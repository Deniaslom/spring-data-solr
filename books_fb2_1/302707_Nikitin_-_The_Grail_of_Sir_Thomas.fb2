<p>Chapter
1</p>

<p>The scorching Saracen sun is burning the
endless orange world. An eagle, barely visible from the ground, has
spread his wings high in the blue of the sky, as if nailed to the
firmament. The air is sweltering, swaying in translucent waves.</p>

<p>Along the broad trodden road, a huge knight
rode a heavy black stallion, heading to the north. Jets of
overheated air are trembling over his iron armor, beads of sweat
trickling down his unprotected face. His sky blue eyes, a color
never seen here before the arrival of Franks, look defiantly. The
knight seems to be seeking for a reason to grab the hilt of his
long sword with his gauntleted hand.</p>

<p>The huge stallion kept a steady pace fitting
for a long journey. He left a track of hoof prints, each as large
as a plate, on the ground as hard as stone, trodden by myriads of
hooves and feet.</p>

<p>A white cloak, with a red cross embroidered
elaborately on it, is flowing from the knight’s armored shoulders.
At the left hip, he has a triangular shield, a bit rumpled, showing
a sword and a lyre upon starry field. On the right, a great
two-handed sword is strapped to the saddle, the iron hilt is wiped
to a shine. A small bag of camping things is bulging on the
horseback behind him.</p>

<p>The crusader had a lance pointed upward in
his right hand. The spike was glittering with orange, as if he
carried a red-hot lump of metal on top of it. The stallion stepped
heavily, glanced askew at his rider with a sullen fiery eye. The
mounted knight looked like an animated statue, one of those
numerous Pagan remnants on the squares of Rome.</p>

<p>The sun was dazzling. The air seemed to be
rising from the Hell’s stove that waited for all the infidels and
sinners to burn them. Away from the road, there was a puny group of
trees, some people in colored, mottled oriental robes lying in the
sparse shadow. Three more men found the shadow under a cart, their
bare feet stuck out. Some buffalos stood in the middle of a muddy
puddle, which could pass for a lake in this land. They were as
motionless as boulders, with only their snouts out of the mud.</p>

<p>The knight passed by the grove without moving
a muscle. It did not befit Sir Thomas Malton of Gisland, the
crusader and hero of the capture of Jerusalem, to show his weakness
before the eyes of conquered people.</p>

<p>The destrier walked slowly, the road was
deserted. Not until midday had Thomas come up with some live
creatures – a string of pilgrims. They went afoot, ragged and
emaciated, without looking up. Thomas whispered a thanking prayer
to Our Lady for his being a noble knight. <emphasis>Cloaks on these
travelers are dirtier than a cloth for people to wipe their shoes
on.</emphasis></p>

<p>The pilgrims, covered with grey road dust,
dragged their tired feet on. Their worn-out shoes were falling to
pieces even as they went. Each one looked like a scarecrow or a
skeleton in hooded cloak. The dust raised by their feet made Thomas
cough, he spurred to leave them behind. None of pilgrims cast a
single glance at the magnificent knight: they had seen lots of his
sort in the Holy Land. However, the knight had also seen all that
lot of travelers, pilgrims, madmen, dervishes, even prophets.</p>

<p>The dark wall of forest was approaching. The
destrier looked there with hope for rest and cool, but it was still
far, so he didn’t bother to mend his pace. The road went across a
small village. Thomas adjusted his sword baldric, alerted. Since
the army of crusaders had passed there with fire and sword, the
resistance of Saracen was broken, but the land remained wild. <emphasis>A
lone warrior should stay alert if he doesn’t want his throat cut in
the night.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas lowered his visor with a metal clink.
His eyes looked closely through the narrow slit in his steel
helmet. At that moment, he saw no beauty of that place: just flat
earthen roofs from where some hothead could throw a spear, and tall
leafy plane trees, a good hide for archers…</p>

<p>He heard some dogs ahead, barking and
growling with malice. The destrier snorted, laid his ears back but
did not lose the step. Once Thomas entered the outskirts, he saw,
in some ten steps ahead, a pack of scraggy dogs attacking a pilgrim
who was pelted with sticks and clods of dry earth from behind the
earthen wall. Dogs snapped at his rags and legs. He did not even
try to protect himself with his thick staff: he could barely
stagger along on his legs covered with bloody clots, with a fresh
red trickle running down the calf. As mongrels smelt blood, their
attacks became fiercer. One dog jumped, clawed at the poor man’s
back and hung there, pawing his flesh.</p>

<p>Once the pack heard the hooves, they growled
louder. A dog tried to snap at the stallion’s leg. Thomas hit it
with the end of the shaft, the yelping mongrel jumped away. Some
Saracen children showed their curly heads up over the fence,
hurling sticks and stones at Thomas. Dogs surrounded him, snarling,
pouncing, looking ready to attack all together. The destrier
shorted anxiously. Thomas reined up to keep the scared horse from
bolting. He turned his lance quickly, speared a dog, shook the
squealing blood-stained body off and struck another mongrel’s
spine.</p>

<p>The speared dog crawled in the dust, its guts
dragged behind, leaving a wet track. The pack crowded around. One
mongrel licked the blood, and suddenly all of them attacked the
wounded creature. They tangled into a ball, hair flying all around
from it, the dog squealed in agony.</p>

<p>The pilgrim leaned on his staff, his face
hidden under the hood. Thomas heard his rattling breath: it sounded
like some torn bellows blown nearby.</p>

<p>“Take my stirrup,” Thomas ordered with
disgust. “These mad dogs will rip you.”</p>

<p>“Grace... upon you... good sire,” the pilgrim
answered in a choked husky voice.</p>

<p>His hand, which seemed skeletal to Thomas,
appeared from a torn sleeve. The destrier snorted with disgust for
the pilgrim’s bad smell.</p>

<p>Thomas could barely hold the stallion in. The
pilgrim dragged himself along, clinging to the stirrup. He looked a
real fright in his loose shredded cloak, definitely off another
man’s back.</p>

<p>When they passed the village, the pilgrim
released the stirrup and fell into the dust in exhaustion. His
wide-open mouth gasped for air. His eyes sank down, lips turned
pale and bloodless, his breath howled like a cold winter wind in a
chimney. “Thank God...”</p>

<p>“Laudetur Jesus Christus,” Thomas muttered
piously.</p>

<p>The destrier trotted away in haste. Not until
the stranger was left far behind did he take a heavy slow pace
again.</p>

<p>The forest was approaching slowly. The sun
was setting. Red and burning it was, like a half-finished hot sword
on the anvil. The air was so dry that it scratched his throat.
Thomas felt like having been hungry for ages. His tired body ached,
his destrier stumbled more and more often.</p>

<p>The road stopped twisting. It seemed to dash
as fast as it could to the salutary coolness of the green forest,
where a stream could be found. Thomas rode up to the nearest trees.
As branches shielded him from the burning sun, his shoulders
squared and his back straightened. His warhorse gave a short neigh
as he trotted by a narrow path among big stocky trees. Thomas
recognized oaks, hornbeams, and elms. The rest were nasty Saracen
plants, none of them allowed by Holy Virgin to grow in his blessed
Britain.</p>

<p>“We’ll have a rest soon,” Thomas soothed his
destrier. “This grove must have a spring. I feel coolness with all
my knightly heart and soul, like a hungry lion!”</p>

<p>He heard a crack in the shrubs ahead. A big
thickset soldier tumbled out of there, like a huge boar, clad in a
shining helmet and a breastplate pulled over a dirt-colored leather
jacket. He had broad shoulders and wry legs, a wide dagger on his
belt, a huge battleax in hands.</p>

<p>The robber looked derisive and sounded
stentorian: “A knight on his warhorse! Not the sort to set off
without gold. Yes, good sire?”</p>

<p>Three more men jumped out on both sides. Thin
and swarthy, clad in ragged Saracen clothes and turbans, they had
resentful looks on their faces and curved narrow swords in hands.
Those one-edged weapons had the local name of sabers. The three of
them kept their eyes on Thomas, while he only watched the soldier.
Definitely a deserter from the great Crusader army, that one was
heavy, strong in arms, his splitting axe far more dangerous than
light sabers.</p>

<p>The Saracen blurted in broken Frank language,
“Silver also... good.”</p>

<p>The leader grunted with content. “Then we’ll
fleece him. Hey, knight! You have a rare chance to leave without a
fight.”</p>

<p>Thomas reined up in five steps before the
leader who crouched with his eyes fixed on the knight’s hands. The
other three set on from the sides.</p>

<p>“All right, go without a fight,” Thomas
agreed.</p>

<p>The leader exposed his yellow crooked teeth
in a smirk. “You go. Leave everything and go.”</p>

<p>“You can’t take me like that,” Thomas replied
tensely. “I fought in the Holy Land, I slew hundreds of
Saracens...”</p>

<p>“Looks like you ran from hard fists in your
home Britain, huh?” the leader asked mockingly. “Or Germany? Get
off your horse! Move it, or we’ll help you.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked over the four of them
haughtily, reined up with deliberate slowness. His thoughts darted
feverishly. He thanked Our Lady for preventing him from taking his
armor off, despite this damned heat, which was definitely sent from
the Hell by Satan himself.</p>

<p>“I passed the lands of Saracen,” he replied
arrogantly. “I will pass here too!”</p>

<p>The deserter raised his axe. Thomas turned
left, pulled the heavy sword out and slashed, holding it with one
hand The axe staff crunched like a straw. The deserter dashed
aside: too late. Thomas felt a start of sword hilt in his fingers,
heard a creepy tinkle. The robber’s arm, cut away near the
shoulder, plopped down on the ground, still gripping the stick.</p>

<p>The robber uttered a terrible shriek. Thomas
turned his shield quickly to the right. A pounding strike in the
center of it made his arm numb. The thieves dropped their sabers.
The warhorse made two giant leaps, he saw the open road ahead, a
sparkling stream...</p>

<p>Something pounced upon him, a strong hand
gripped his throat. Thomas swayed, falling down. At the last moment
he pulled his feet out of the stirrups, as he was taught to, caught
the enemy’s arm, wriggled and collapsed on top of him.</p>

<p>Thomas weighed hundred and ninety pounds, and
his armor put him at two hundred and fifty. The robber gasped,
blood gushed out of his mouth. Thomas raised himself a little. He
heard another tramp flee, fell aside, and a short spear crunched
into the stunned robber’s chest.</p>

<p>Thomas rose, still a bit stunned by the fall.
His helmet had slipped down on his eyes, he set it straight. He had
barely heard fast breath behind when someone socked him on head.
Stunned, Thomas wheeled round and saw a dim giant figure. The giant
swung his arm for a new terrible blow. Thomas grasped he had no
sword in hand, nor a solid heavy shield. He jumped aside, his head
buzzing, his heavy armor a burden. A dreadful strike froze his
shoulder, he heard a crunch of either his bone or his iron armor
plate.</p>

<p>The robber swung for the last crushing blow.
Thomas’s mind cleared. His enemy turned out to be no giant but a
small Saracen, dark and very evil, with bare teeth. A sharp saber
was useless against the armored knight but the Saracen had a
battleax instead, or maybe a cleaver, with its blade narrow as a
beak. He attacked Thomas hastily, with a hail of quick blows,
allowing the knight no time to regain his senses. Thomas backed,
trying to shield with forearms and elbows. His head was clearing,
his strength coming back, but his armor cracked of violent
blows!</p>

<p>Thomas was still choosing the right time when
his knees were jogged by something behind. He flipped his hands,
trying to keep his feet. The Saracen jumped ahead with a scream,
brandished, aiming at the knight’s face. Thomas dropped on his
back. He saw a scary flash of steel, heard the axe swish past him
and caught it in the air. The blow was hard but Thomas held on to
the weapon and rolled aside. Something tinkled under his body, his
fingers found the leader’s giant axe. That one had a short staff,
like Thor’s hammer.</p>

<p>Thomas had time to rise to his knees. The
robber gave him a heavy sider, Thomas got rigid with sharp pain.
The robber yelled bestially, his eyes goggled, his mouth spitting.
His sharp blade aimed at Thomas’s face, with those hateful eyes
looking through the narrow slit: bright blue, as though the very
sky was seen through the Frank’s skull.</p>

<p>Thomas seized the axe with left hand, as his
right arm hung helpless, stepped to meet a new blow, felt hot
spreading within his side, his body contorted with pain. He blocked
the axe blade with elbow. The new pain made his teeth clench, but
at the same moment he struck back heavily.</p>

<p>The broad steel axe blade clove the Saracen’s
head down to his teeth. The blood spurted out powerfully, like
splashes from a huge stone thrown into a puddle colored by a
sunset.</p>

<p>Thomas dropped his axe, staggered along the
road. Stout trees wriggled around like snakes, but Thomas saw his
clever stallion who was nibbling grass and fresh leaves hastily,
knowing his master would not linger.</p>

<p>Thomas struggled to pick up his shield and
sword. Those were incredibly heavy, he dragged them on. His steel
armor had a crack on the side, the red oozing out of it. Thomas
felt more blood spreading under the armor, soaking his knitted
shirt, squelching in his boot.</p>

<p>The stallion stopped eating around, ready to
break into a gallop, but the knight stood still, clinging to the
saddle. The destrier snorted, turned his head in surprise to sniff
Thomas. The knight had lost much blood, everything was going dark
before his eyes. With great effort, he hung his sword on the saddle
hook, then the shield. He felt too weak to clamber up the saddle
but he must have managed it somehow, as later he saw, in
half-oblivion, some green branches moving towards him until all the
world went dark.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Cold tickling drops crept down his face. He
opened his eyes and saw nothing but grey mist. He could not move.
As he groaned, his voice sounded surprisingly hoarse and weak.</p>

<p>Some fingers touched his face. The grey
curtain disappeared: it was a wet cloth, now removed from his eyes.
He saw a gaunt face over him, it looked like a skull stretched
around tightly with dry skin. The man was deathly pale, his massive
cheekbones so protruding that they threatened to break the skin.
Thomas felt creepy all over. The skull said in a rasping voice,
“Gods do not call you, sir.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at his bony fingers holding the
wet cloth. Behind the pilgrim, Thomas saw his own sword, shield,
and dagger hanging on a scaly oak, his armor a heap below it. The
wind ruffled the hair on his chest, and he realized lying naked to
the waist on a pile of twigs, his belly tied up with clean strips.
Under them, he felt some thick twigs at his side, which was still
burning, pitching, stinging with pain.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” Thomas whispered. His voice
broke and hissed, so it sounded like “thanks.” “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“A wonderer<sup>1</sup>,” the pilgrim
replied in a dull, lifeless but strong voice.</p>

<p>“A wanderer?” Thomas repeated.</p>

<p>“A wonderer,” the pilgrim said again. “This
is…”</p>

<p>Thomas struggled to remain conscious, but the
pilgrim’s voice was fading, like a sugarplum while sucked. Finally,
it disappeared.</p>

<p>When Thomas came to himself, much later, he
ran into the same grey mist, guessed to pull the wet cloth away but
put it back the next moment: his forehead was burning terribly, as
if sore of hitting against Beelzebub’s hardest pot.</p>

<p>The wonderer hunched, as still as stone, by a
small fire. He had taken his cloak off to put Thomas on it, and the
knight shuddered with both pity and disgust for the pilgrim’s
terrible emaciation. <emphasis>A skeleton clad in skin and wisps of
rags.</emphasis> As the fire warmed him, the abominable smell of unwashed
body drifted over.</p>

<p>“What’s your name?” Thomas asked in a faint
voice. “Where are you from?”</p>

<p>The wanderer turned his head slowly, as if it
took him a great effort. His eyes were dark, with reddish sparkles
in pupils. “I come from Rus’<sup>2</sup>,” he spoke slowly. “My name
is Oleg. I have come to the Holy Land for a feat, just as you.”</p>

<p>Thomas coughed, winced with sharp pain at his
wounded side. He felt bruises all over his body where the heavy
blows of the robber’s axe had caved his armor in. “Never mind,”
Thomas comforted, gasping for breath. “You’ll have it another
way.”</p>

<p>“I had it,” the pilgrim replied in a flat
voice. “Everything I wished.”</p>

<p>Thomas chocked, raised himself on elbows in
great astonishment, despite the sharp pain he suffered from that.
“But, holy wonderer! You look like a man just out of Saracen
prison… and beaten with all the canes of Nile and Euphrates before
that!”</p>

<p>“My feat,” the wonderer said faintly.</p>

<p>Thomas lay down. “A feat is to kill a
dragon,” he objected wearily. “To storm into the midst of Saracen
hosts, kill their best warriors, capture their banner! A feat is to
rescue a princess and to hammer her kidnapper into the ground up to
his nostrils…” He fell silent, black flies dancing before his
eyes.</p>

<p>Oleg the wonderer stirred the crimson coals
with a twig, slowly and silently, with a thoughtful look on his
face. Suddenly he leaned, snatched something that looked like a
small round stone, shifted it to his other palm. “A dozen of baked
eggs. You can’t do without food.”</p>

<p>The smell was exciting. Thomas recalled
himself riding to the forest. Hungry as a hunter he was, dreaming
of food and some rest in the shadow of trees. “<emphasis>You</emphasis> can,” he
replied impetuously. “I see it.”</p>

<p>The hermit raked the rest of the eggs out of
the fire. Thomas shelled them with trembling fingers. He swallowed
half a dozen without sensing their taste. Not until his stomach got
full and heavy did he check himself. “Oh, holy wonderer, I am
sorry! I was so hungry…”</p>

<p>“Not holy,” Oleg corrected gently. “There are
holy sorcerers, holy hermits and preceptors, but wonderers are just
wonderers.”</p>

<p>He changed the knight’s bandages and examined
his wound. In times Thomas passed out in a fever. His side was
still burning but the acute pain subsided. “God reckon it to you,”
he said clumsily but with proper pride. “You linger here because of
me.”</p>

<p>“I’m in no hurry,” the wonderer comforted.
“Your recovery is fast. Stop that, you owe me nothing. You have
protected me from those mad dogs. I’m just paying back.”</p>

<p>“Quits then.”</p>

<p>Thomas woke up with fever several more times.
Each time Oleg’s face with sad eyes hung over him. Cold drops ran
down the knight’s cheeks, as Oleg put on his forehead the cloth, so
icy cold that Thomas would have removed it if only he had enough
strength.</p>

<p>Finally, he fell so fast asleep that he would
wake in another dream, and he did it several times before he found
himself under the familiar oak, on a thick pile of twigs covered
with his cloak. The rest of his clothes hung on the tree.</p>

<p>The hermit was sitting in three steps. He
watched indifferently the fire burn out, the thin coating of grey
spread over coals. Thomas felt his stomach getting anxious,
twitching and howling.</p>

<p>Oleg looked up. His sunken eyes flashed red
for a moment. “Back to yourself? Your wound is healing. You may
stand up, slowly.”</p>

<p>“Holy father,” Thomas spoke in a shaky voice.
“I have famine mirages as if I were still walking in Saracen sands.
I smell roast…”</p>

<p>“I’ve shot a wild boar,” the wonderer said
indifferently. “Does your faith forbid to eat pork?”</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t!” Thomas cried fervently and
coughed. “Not at all!”</p>

<p>He raised himself a little and was surprised
by having managed it with only a little prickle in his side. Oleg
raked the coals with a sharp twig, hooked a flat brown stone and
offered Thomas. The knight grasped that it was no stone but a
thoroughly roasted slice of meat, so he took it. The hot juice
dripped down, burnt his fingers. He swore, dropped the slice on the
ground, picked it, dug his teeth into the meat hungrily, ignoring
the blades of grass stuck to it – but it was too hot. He spat it
out hastily, threw into his other palm, devouring the slice with
his eyes. The juice was pouring off the bite.</p>

<p>“How you did it?” Thomas wondered. “I had no
bow. It’s no knightly weapon!”</p>

<p>“I made it,” the wonderer dismissed. “Sticks
are everywhere, and the cord of your baldric made a bow
string.”</p>

<p>Gnawing at his meat, Thomas watched the
wonderer with astonishment. <emphasis>However, the boar might have been
never chased before. Or stupid. Or he might have found the animal
wounded and dying.</emphasis> “Doesn’t your faith forbid you to kill?”</p>

<p>The wonderer was surprised. “No one stops
killing due to their gods. Why would I?”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Gods?</emphasis>” Thomas said with horror. “You
are Pagan!” He dropped his meat again, picked it from the ground,
oblivious of grits and dry grass crunching in his teeth.</p>

<p>The wonderer shrugged indifferently. “My
faith is kinder. No persecutions. You can put up the pillar or
cross for Christ beside our gods. This is the way Khors, Simargl,
and even Taran of Celts came to us. And we accepted them.”</p>

<p>“A Pagan!” Thomas repeated with disgust.
“Christ is the god of gods! <emphasis>He</emphasis> is supreme!”</p>

<p>“Put him beside,” the wonderer insisted. “If
people begin to sacrifice to him only, we’ll remove other
gods.”</p>

<p>“Christ accepts no sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“What about praises and canticles? Or some
fragrant smoke?”</p>

<p>Thomas wished to close his ears, but there
were juicy slices of pink meat steaming over charcoal. He smelled
their fragrance. The wonderer hooked a slice after a slice and
offered him. Finally, the twig itself was given to Thomas. He
gulped the food down, his voice half-choked. “Why aren’t <emphasis>you</emphasis>
eating? I can see the sun through you.”</p>

<p>Oleg hesitated over the last slice sprawled
in the crimson coals like a squashed turtle. He shrugged his
pointed shoulders with doubt. “I don’t know… I would live on
locusts and wild honey for a long time. I would eat leaves and
grass. But meat… It rouses a beast in you.”</p>

<p>“Er… Does it? I only feel appetite rouse in
me.”</p>

<p>The wonderer curled his pallid lips in a
ghost of smile, his teeth as white and sharp as a predator’s. He
picked the hot slice with bare hands and did not wince, rolled it
in palms, pressed it. His face seemed motionless: Thomas was not
good at reading expressions on skulls stretched with skin.</p>

<p>He held his breath when the pilgrim brought
the slice to his pale lips. They opened and touched the roast meat,
his nostrils trembled, smelling it. Then the wonderer touched it
cautiously with teeth.</p>

<p>Thomas did not dare to move while he watched
Oleg eat. When the wonderer swallowed the last bit (masticated
almost into a gruel), Thomas breathed out with relief. “There you
are! Beyond locusts and wild honey!”</p>

<p>The pilgrim turned to him with bewildered
eyes, then nodded as he grasped it. “You don’t understand… In my
faith, no food is forbidden. It was part of my feat! <emphasis>Self</emphasis> is
the hardest to overcome. A fast sets the power of spirit over body.
I was hungry for bloody meat but fed myself with leaves. I desired
women but spent my time alone in the cave… Full abstention is what
it needs to find the Truth. But the best lot is not to abstain from
pleasures but to rule them, without them ruling you… Try to get
it.”</p>

<p>Thomas didn’t. “You still keep your Pagan
beliefs, don’t you?” he asked with disappointment.</p>

<p>“So far I do,” the wonderer replied gently.
“The power of my spirit is strong enough to keep my flesh from
trembling at the sight of meat or any hearty meal. You see, I can
have it and remain calm. Thus I can proceed up: from small
reclusion to the Great…”</p>

<p>Thomas did not listen. He had fallen asleep,
sated by food.</p>

<p>On the seventh day, the knight tried to
mount. Once the stallion took his pace, Thomas got pallor as dead
and swung. The wonderer barely had time to catch the knight falling
down.</p>

<p>When Thomas came to his senses, he was lying
under the same oak. All the day long the wonderer was boiling some
stinking broth of roots and herbs in the knight’s helmet, knocking
black excrescences down from birch trees to chop into it. He made
Thomas drink the vile bitter mix, with all the hard wing cases and
little sharp-clawed legs floating there.</p>

<p>Thomas cursed the names of Beelzebub and
Astaroth but drank it. As a noble knight, he knew little about
potions, leaving it to lesser men, but he took his new friend’s
word for it, as believing is noble and Christian.</p>

<p>The wonderer made potions and decoctions and
shot birds skillfully with self-made arrows. Once he shot a young
badger. As Thomas ate, his young muscled body, hardened in battles,
campaigns and far journeys, filled with strength quickly. In times
he would get up and listen to his body. The wounded side was
aching, but no sharp pain.</p>

<p>“When have you washed yourself last time,
holy father?”</p>

<p>“Last month I got caught in a heavy shower,”
Oleg replied with a vacant look.</p>

<p>“Oh. Is there any water nearby? I caught a
glimpse of a stream while falling from the horseback…”</p>

<p>“It is,” the wonderer confirmed. He became
thoughtful, spoke slowly, “Yeah, I have forgotten… The Great
Reclusion permits everything that is allowed to others. So I
can…”</p>

<p>He came back wet and clean, with his hair
plastered to his head and his eyes shining. Thomas watched him in
amazement: the wonderer’s hair turned out to be the color of
sunset, his face as white as if it were never exposed to the sun.
His eyes also had an odd color: green as spring grass, green and
sad.</p>

<p>“You are not Saxon, are you?” Thomas
wondered.</p>

<p>“I’m Slav. And you? From Britain?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I was born on the banks of Don,” Thomas
said with a faraway look. “My castle stands in the bend near the
estuary. It’s surrounded by woods… and bogs and marshes. Britain is
all woods and marshes. The hill under my castle is the only dry
place within hundred miles. The forest is crowded with aurochs,
boars and deer, not to mention badgers and hares. Cries of birds
are driving you mad. Fish are hitting your boat with their heads,
asking to be caught…”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded. “I’ve also loved it on Don.”</p>

<p>Thomas wheeled round lively, his eyes
glittered. “Have you been there?”</p>

<p>“Dozens of times.”</p>

<p>“Have you seen a high castle of white, white
stone? It stands in the bend of the river, with its moat and
rampart on the left…”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head. “I’ve been on the banks
of Don in the Eastern Rus’, Palestine, Colchis, Arabia, Gishpaniya,
Hellas… Rivers got the name of Don wherever the sons of Scyth
came.”</p>

<p>Thomas twitched. “Did those wild Scythians
ever conquer Britain?” he asked with threat.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to the Holy Land without
conquering it, haven’t I? Once Targitai, the great chieftain… or
that was Koloksai<sup>3</sup>?.. decided to replace Dana, the
old goddess of nomads, with Apia, Mother Earth. He wanted to turn
nomads into plowmen at once! Of course, that turned a bloody
strife… After the battle, the Old Believers crossed all Europe and
settled on the Tin Islands. They made some old-way altars of
colossal stones, <emphasis>dolmens</emphasis>… Have you seen them? No? That’s a
pity. The place is beautiful. Stonehenge, that’s the name of it.
The Old Believers also gave names to rivers. <emphasis>Don</emphasis> is a
Scythian word for river. The city built in the estuary was named
London, which means <emphasis>standing in the mouth of the river</emphasis>.
Other Scythian word for estuary is <emphasis>ustye</emphasis>. In Rus’, we also
have cities named Ust-Izhora, Ust-Ilim or simply
Ustug…”<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>“I’ve never seen any savages there,” Thomas
interrupted haughtily. “We Angles live on the banks of Don since
the beginning of time. Since God created us right there, just after
He made all the world, in six months only!”</p>

<p>“Six <emphasis>days</emphasis>,” the wonderer corrected in
a meek voice.</p>

<p>“I know it,” Thomas snarled. “I was afraid a
Pagan wouldn’t believe it. Six days is really a… And six months is
enough time for <emphasis>your</emphasis> gods to do the same if they work
altogether!”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter
2</p>

<p>On the tenth day Thomas managed to climb into
his armor. Still weak and staggering, he mounted with the
wonderer’s help. The restive destrier neighed, tried to take a
majestic pace. The wonderer seized the rein hastily, the horse
stopped dead. His hand on the rein was as wide as an oar, his arm,
bony and gnarled, with some flesh added to it, seemed to be carved
of old oak. He became even broader in shoulders, his face a bit
livened up, but his eyes still full of anguish.</p>

<p>“Thank God,” Thomas said. “Do your gods allow
you to accept rewards?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, I need very little. If no grass,
I eat bark. I sleep on bare ground or stones. Goodbye! And good
luck.”</p>

<p>The knight tried to raise his lance in a
salute but failed. He gave a guilty smile instead, his destrier
took a steady pace, doing his best not to shake the knight. The
wonderer picked his cloak and staff, which he called a crutch, and
strolled along the same road slowly, lost in brooding.</p>

<p>The path winded among trees, the open space
visible ahead. A squirrel ran along the branch over the walk, saw
the strolling man and paused in curiosity, its little teeth made a
clank. A big bird flew past him heavily, tried to perch on a
branch, but her legs were stiff from long sitting in the nest, so
the bird rocked and flapped her wings until her talons regained
confidence.</p>

<p>Oleg stepped softly, trying not to disturb
that bird, a broody hen. Her belly looked pink and pitiful, with
bare skin where feathers had been plucked away to warm the nest.
The bird was emaciated. <emphasis>She seldom leaves her nest and eats
almost nothing, busy with warming and guarding her brood.</emphasis></p>

<p>A doe passed in twenty steps without fear,
followed by a young thin-legged deer. She was alerted, her ears
moved. The doe gave Oleg only a guarded look: he did not seem to
pose any danger. She nuzzled into branches, plucked some fresh
leaves and chewed them, her eyes half-closed with languish. The
young deer gaped at dragonflies while being fed by his mother.</p>

<p>The trees parted. Oleg plunged into the hot
air. The sun pounced upon him, frying him in his cloak. Oleg threw
the hood back, exposing his head to hot rays.</p>

<p>An ordinary hermit perfects himself in
solitude, far from the vanity of the world: in a cave, desert,
woods, or mountains. Such hermits number in thousands. In agonizing
reflection, they obtain the Truth and bring it into the world.
Gautama obtained his Truth in wild woods, Zarathustra secluded
himself in mountains, Christ fasted in a desert for forty days, and
Mahomet heard Allah while brooding on the top of a lone
mountain.</p>

<p><emphasis>But there is a more difficult sort of
reclusion: being among people, dressing, eating, and doing as they
do, but living this life with your flesh only, while your soul
remains as clean and sublime as it was on the mountain peak. Many
tried Great Reclusion, but few succeeded in it!</emphasis></p>

<p>The road meandered in hills. Twice Oleg saw
odd ugly olives with swollen trunks, which only grew in that land,
until the hills parted and the road went out into the open.</p>

<p>Far ahead, there was a lofty fortified castle
– a gloomy building of four floors, with a tall watchtower. At that
moment the castle was ramparted. It looked swarmed with ants, but
those were lots of men: dragging huge stones, tying them round to
lift onto the wall. Oleg saw their bare backs bustling everywhere
and the wet glister of trunks that were barked on the go.</p>

<p>The road forked: one branch turned to the
castle eagerly while another went by. The wonderer passed by the
castle without interest: he had seen lots of its sort. Since the
Saracen were defeated and Jerusalem with her lands captured, the
Frank crusaders fortified hastily, enclosing with walls. Kings vied
with each other in bestowing the lands they did not control on
their knights, and each knight rushed to build a castle to shelter
behind its solid walls.</p>

<p>The castle keep is a tall square tower: wide
and massive, formed by huge granite blocks. It is surrounded by
smaller buildings, their roofs barely visible over the high
rampart. The castle stands in the bend of a river – a common way to
ensure better protection. On the other side, there is a deep moat
dug from the river and filled with its water. The massive gate is
deep in the wall, under the arched cornice, flanked with two small
towers where guards would hide.</p>

<p>The wonderer had left the castle far on the
left and behind when he heard a fast clatter of hooves approach
from there. Without looking back, he stepped off the road and past
the roadside. He knew the wicked men’s habit to whip pedestrians
while riding.</p>

<p>Hooves clattered past him. He saw three men
on light slim-legged horses. The last rider looked back at him,
shouted and stopped. Others reined up reluctantly. The three of
them are dressed in motley rags but all have sabers and daggers.
One also has a bow on his back and a quiver full of feathered
arrows by his saddle. Their faces are hungry and evil.</p>

<p>“Hey you,” the back rider cried harshly.
“Whose man?”</p>

<p>“A pilgrim, good people,” Oleg replied
meekly. “On my way home from the Holy Land.”</p>

<p>“Where’s your home?” the rider demanded. His
friends held their horses who were longing for gallop.</p>

<p>“Rus’.”</p>

<p>The riders exchanged glances. “Never heard of
it,” the back one said angrily. “Some made-up place, huh?”</p>

<p>“Or a tiny kingdom!” a different rider
cried.</p>

<p>“Tiny as my nail!”</p>

<p>“Very good,” the back rider resolved. “He’s
no one’s man.” He dismounted, prodded Oleg’s chest with a whip
handle. Oleg did not stir when the man felt the muscle on his arms
and chest efficiently. Then he made Oleg open his mouth and counted
his teeth.</p>

<p>The first rider cried impatiently, “You’re
ready to grab all sorts of carrion, Ternak! Look! He’s a bag of
bones.”</p>

<p>“He’s from Europe,” the second rider added.
“Our blood.”</p>

<p>Ternak laughed. “God said He knew no Gentile
or Jew. So everyone is equal to Baron’s stone quarry, ha ha! Take
him to Murad.”</p>

<p>They surrounded the pilgrim: two with bare
sabers, the third with an arrow on the bow string. Oleg looked in
their faces of skillful slavers, experts in this gods-awful
trade.</p>

<p>“Stretch your hands!” Ternak commanded. “Not
ahead! Behind you!”</p>

<p>Oleg crossed his arms behind him
submissively. Ternak put a rope on them deftly, tied his hands
together. Another rider helped him to lift Oleg on the horseback.
Ternak shook his hands off. “So heavy a bag of bones!” he said with
surprise. “Abdullah! Take him to Murad and join us.”</p>

<p>Abdullah swore, mounted hastily and galloped
to the castle, whooping and holding the bound pilgrim.</p>

<p>They had barely entered the courtyard when a
huge creature covered with black hair came out to meet them. He
seemed to Oleg half a man, half a beast, with his low forehead,
close small eyes, huge massive jaw and absent neck: his
boulder-like head was seated on muscular shoulders directly. His
bare chest resembled a beer cask, his legs looked as though he
spent his whole life seated on that cask, but his arms were as big
and thick as tree trunks but covered with thick black hair instead
of bark.</p>

<p>The enormous man wiped his hooked fingers,
which looked fire-tempered, on a hem of his blood-stained leather
apron. He looked the wonderer over with revulsion. “That one a
croak on his first day! Kadji damn you, Ternak…”</p>

<p>Oleg was brought to a low stone barn. The
door was ajar, the inside smelled of sewage and stiff air. They
pushed Oleg forcefully into the dark. His foot found no floor, he
went rolling down the stairs and came back to himself on the stone
floor covered with wisps of rotten straw.</p>

<p>He heard the door shut and barred upwards. A
strong hand touched his shoulder, a mocking voice said into his
ear, “Hail to the builder of new world!”</p>

<p>Oleg’s eyes got accustomed to the semi-dark
quickly. He discerned about twenty half-naked men along the walls.
Each one had a tarnished metal collar round his neck, three were
fettered. “Which world?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>“The new one,” the other man mocked. “Fair
one! Christian one! Baron Otset’s castle among barbarity. An
outpost of Christian host in the land of Saracen…” He was
half-naked, his back in awful swollen wales. His face was crossed
by a lacerated crimson wale, his left eye swollen.</p>

<p>Oleg sat up, rubbed his numb hands. “I heard
of… a stone quarry?”</p>

<p>The man grinned, baring sharp stubs of front
teeth. His gums were bleeding. “Ever worked stone?”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, still looking around. <emphasis>If the
man wants to see the novice frightened, he’ll be disappointed.
Pilgrims see many things in their travels.</emphasis></p>

<p>“A pilgrim?”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded at that again. The stranger went
on, “Half pilgrims here. Baron gives us a chance to build the
Kingdom of Heaven on Earth. For him, surely. The castle’s done, now
the wall raised… My name’s Yarlat.”</p>

<p>“I’m Oleg. From Rus’.”</p>

<p>“It is somewhere in Hyperborea<sup>5</sup>?”</p>

<p>In the next morning Oleg was brought to the
forge. Two strong warriors put an iron ring around his neck. The
forger was skillful and fast to join the metal ends and rivet them
together. The skin on Oleg’s throat got burnt a bit.</p>

<p>The guard made a strong slap on his back. “I
love pilgrims! Humble, accepting. Other pigheaded. Yesterday two of
‘em fed to dogs alive.”</p>

<p>The collar was burning hot, slow to cool. The
guards led Oleg through the main gate outside. In half a mile from
the castle, there was a pit large enough to contain two or three
such castles. Fine sharp dust was rising from it. Oleg heard heavy
blows of iron on stone.</p>

<p>The guard led Oleg up to the brink, pointed
at a wooden ladder. “Get down! No pick for you, drag stone out. The
foreman show you in.”</p>

<p>Down in the pit, half-naked men were pounding
rocks with heavy picks, making holes in the stone, driving wooden
stakes into the holes and watering. The wet swollen wood would
break stone. The broken boulders were tied round with ropes and
lifted up.</p>

<p>The foreman frowned at his new slave. “You
drag broken stone. To that wall. On top only those won’t try to
escape. We don’t know if you will.”</p>

<p>Silently, Oleg gripped a sparkling colored
edge of the cut-off boulder. The black-bearded man who took it by
another side told him through gritted teeth, “Don’t be idle, but
don’t work fingers to bone. Or you won’t live till evening!”</p>

<p>They spent all the forenoon either rolling or
dragging stones to the wall. Rope ends were thrown down from above,
Oleg and the black-bearded man called Shaggy tied the stones round,
dawdling with knots to extend the moments of rest. Then boulders
were lifted up with poignant slowness, their sharp edges scratched
the stone wall, the crumbs of granite fell down.</p>

<p>After a brief lunchtime, when each slave was
given a dried fish and a slice of bread, Oleg was told to drive the
wooden wedges. Others were watering. The slab of stone underfoot
was crackling and groaning when Oleg felt a strange strain in it.
Next to him, two moaning slaves were rolling a broken-off boulder
with long poles.</p>

<p>“Step aside,” Oleg warned them. “Or you may
be injured.”</p>

<p>The slaves looked bewildered. The foreman
gave him a sharp look, then suddenly barked at them, “Get away!”
The slaves flew up, like birds flushed. The huge slab gave a crack.
A boulder shot up as if hurled by catapult and ploughed the dry
rocky ground two steps long. Oleg stood on the very edge of the
larger slab. The foreman kept his eyes on the novice, his mouth
twisted. “You know stone? Good… Two fools owe to you.”</p>

<p>The slab was broken like an overripe
watermelon: its inside gleaming red with black grains, lined from
top to bottom with straight grooves, water-swollen wedges stuck in
them.</p>

<p>Oleg picked up his excessively heavy hammer.
Slaves moved around like half-dead men, their eyes lackluster. His
heart was wrung with guilt: he still had not found the Truth to
rescue them.</p>

<p><emphasis>There’s nothing truly great about the one
who lifted himself from slavery to the emperor’s throne, as many
did.</emphasis> Oleg used to know Upravda, a blue-eyed shepherd who left
sheep herding in Carpathian Mountains for the throne in
Constantinople. He translated his Slavic name, which meant rule,
governance, and law, into Latin as Justinian to mean the
same<sup>6</sup>. The word <emphasis>justice</emphasis>, derived
from it, spread in Latin and other tongues. He had done much, that
fair-haired shepherd, though the throne was prepared and given to
him by his uncle Justin, once also a shepherd in Carpathians.
<emphasis>But even the most powerful emperor can’t find a way for
happiness. For salvation, as the young Christian faith puts
it.</emphasis></p>

<p>By evening he was hardly able to drag his
feet along. The hammer was dropping out of his hands, twice he
escaped falling boulders only by miracle. Covered with stone
crumbs, dripping with sweat, he could barely hear, through the buzz
in his ears, the foreman shout for everyone to finish work and get
out.</p>

<p>The exhausted workers rushed to the rope
ladders dropped from above, where the guards’ swords rang and
glittered with bare steel. Oleg lingered. His breath burst out in
rattles, his legs quivered.</p>

<p>The foreman whipped him. “Move it!” he
bellowed. “You must be in before dark!”</p>

<p>Someone helped Oleg up to his feet. The
guards above struggled to keep their mad dogs who pawed the ground,
reaching for slaves, and clanked their scary sharp teeth.</p>

<p>The foreman shoved Oleg into the barn, both
collapsed on the dirty floor. Once the gate was slammed behind
them, its folds started to shake. Oleg heard scratches, creepy
howls. A thick paw, as large as a bear’s, tried to squeeze under
the gate.</p>

<p>Oleg turned on his back. The foreman shook
his head. “You endure. No wail… A stoic?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head slowly. “It’s just puny
body suffering. I am free.”</p>

<p>The foreman pulled a mocking face. “But
you’re set in this puny body, aren’t you? You can’t leave it. It’s
<emphasis>your</emphasis> body if I get it right!”</p>

<p>“My <emphasis>soul</emphasis> is desolated. How can I put
body first? Mark Aurelius was right, though an Emperor. He said man
has nothing but his soul.”</p>

<p>“What if body dies? Of this work?”</p>

<p>“Here I’m fed better than I was… in my cave.
I get less tired than I used to be in the work to master my body
with spirit.”</p>

<p>The foreman nodded, with no further interest
in the novice. For previous three years, he had met different
people in the stone quarry: pious men, pilgrims, and stoics, men of
many countries and religions. He had taught ascetics and hermits
who would only wear hefty chains and mutter prayers to break stone.
His primary concern was to reveal a man eager to riot or escape.
That one was neither: he, a foreman for three years, could sense it
from a mile away.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>It was the second week of Oleg’s breaking
stone and dragging heavy boulders. He gained some muscle, though he
still looked gaunt and bony as against others. He was a welcome
workmate: never shirking, ready to take the worst part of it, eager
to help.</p>

<p>Once on his way back to the barn he heard a
man swear and a lash whistle. A big man was crucified on an oaken
cross, his clothes torn off and scattered about the yard. A Saracen
in a huge green turban, naked to his waist, with sugar-white teeth
bared in malice, was lashing the poor man with delight: spinning
the lash over his head, hurling it down with a whistle, each slash
meant to break the skin as deep as possible. The poor man’s back
was lined with crimson wales. Bitter buzzy flies were dropping on
it to lick his blood and ichor before a new lash.</p>

<p>The foreman nudged Oleg as he walked. “A
nobleman,” he said with a frown. “They’d have the likes of us
nailed, and he’s just bound! Held for ransom.”</p>

<p>“Who is he?” Oleg asked aloofly.</p>

<p>“A knight errant. Or maybe just a returnee
from Holy Land. Not every knight lucky as our Baron! Many got their
mouth watered and that’s all. Now would love to get home alive but
scatter their bones on the way…”</p>

<p>They were the last to enter the barn. Guards
prodded them with thick ends of spears and barred the door.
<emphasis>Thomas Malton</emphasis>, Oleg recalled. <emphasis>An arrogant knight. A boy
in the appearance of a man grown, his body in its prime, but his
soul still a bud.</emphasis></p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>In his third week in the stone pit, Oleg saw
a violently bashed man nearby: half-naked, his neck in the iron
collar, his legs chained. It took Oleg some time to recognize him
as Thomas and just a moment to forget it. He worked hard, but his
thought was free to shrink deep into the soul, so he was searching
the Real World desperately for the answers to the questions that
tormented him while in the other world his mortal body, along with
other two-legged animals, would drive wedges, raise a heavy hammer,
drag boulders.</p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a hoarse voice nearby:
“Wonderer? Er… Sir Oleg?”</p>

<p>He saw Thomas’s face: dripping with sweat,
thinned, his southern tan gone. In the clatter of picks around, no
one was looking in their side. “Yes, Sir Thomas, that’s me,” Oleg
replied slowly. He was still in another world.</p>

<p>“I didn’t recognize you at once. This work
does good for you! You got stronger, put some muscle on… Are you
going to stay?”</p>

<p>“I can speak to gods anywhere,” Oleg said
indifferently.</p>

<p>They heard a foreman’s warning shout.
Cursing, Thomas brought his pick down on the rock, the stone
fragments flew high. A cloud of dust raised and made everyone look
alike. In the commotion Oleg lost the sight of Thomas, but in the
evening the knight found him again. “I’ve changed with the man you
worked with,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“We’re all men,” said Oleg indifferently.
“All humans.”</p>

<p>For a while, Thomas crowbarred a granite
boulder, thinking over an answer, then gave a guarded look around
and whispered, “No men here but slaves! Does it befit you, a
freeborn…”</p>

<p>“Slaves are men,” Oleg interrupted.</p>

<p>“Not men like us.”</p>

<p>“No one was made a slave by God. Only by
people.”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head angrily, his blue eyes
blazed with fury. “Sir wonderer! You are too humble. I want to get
out of here. I need help. A bit of help!”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded at the other men’s backs that
glistened with sweat.</p>

<p>Thomas waved away angrily. “They’ve died out.
But not you! I feel a glimmer in you…”</p>

<p>Oleg looked indifferent. He was driving his
crowbar in a narrow slit, crushing the stone. Thomas breathed
heavily. His muscular arms raised the pick over his head
frequently, his blows cracked rocks like rip nuts. The chain on his
ankles clanked miserably.</p>

<p>“You’ll burn out,” Oleg said.</p>

<p>“What?” Thomas wondered.</p>

<p>“Overstrain. Run out of your strength
soon.”</p>

<p>“I shan’t linger! If no way out, I… swear on
the Heaven and Holy Communion, I’ll smash my head!”</p>

<p>His breath rattled, as he had swallowed much
stone dust. His neck was squeezed by the collar, his burnt blisters
rubbed till they bled. The glitter in his eyes could belong to a
small animal at bay, his fingers trembled. Oleg realized clearly
that the handsome knight was not long for this world. At least, for
the part of the world where Baron Otset’s castle stood.</p>

<p>“How will you get out?” Oleg asked without
interest.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Thomas said desperately. “But
here I shan’t live till Sunday. I know it. And no one to trust!
Slaves… They’re <emphasis>slaves</emphasis> after all! It’s only you I know. You
cured me, and I once saved you from dogs!”</p>

<p>The wonderer raised his arms evenly and
strongly, bringing the sharp end of the heavy crowbar down into the
crack between boulders. Thomas could almost see other boulders that
moved unhurriedly in Oleg’s head, casting a dim glimmer into his
impenetrable green eyes.</p>

<p>“But,” the wonderer spoke gently, “people
should not be forced, even to their good. If they can’t forget
their flesh here, if they’re unhappy because of its suffering… they
must be released.”</p>

<p>Thomas jerked his shoulder impatiently. “Damn
your wise words! Who will release them?”</p>

<p>“We,” the wonderer replied in the same humble
voice.</p>

<p>In the evening Thomas was brought to the
common slave barn. None of the exhausted, work-disemboweled men
paid any attention to the novice. Thomas made his way to the corner
where Oleg was sitting. “You’ve travelled a lot,” he whispered with
excitement. “Might have seen more of such pits than I. Do you see a
way to escape?”</p>

<p>“There’s always a way,” Oleg replied softly.
“But our collars will give us away… and our rags. We’ll be stopped
in the nearest village and handed back. No one would like to
quarrel with Baron.”</p>

<p>Thomas nodded. “I think so. And I can’t leave
without… some things. I hate to part with my warhorse, my armor and
sword, but let the damned Baron have it! But in my saddle bag
there’s an old copper cup…” He stopped, gave Oleg a searching
look.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve seen it,” the pilgrim said
quietly. “In search of something to dress your wound… Why is it so
important?”</p>

<p>“It’s holy,” Thomas whispered. “A sacred
thing.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” Oleg said, “ritual. I see. Every our
sorcerer used to have a cup on his belt. Back in the times of
Targitai, the golden plow, yoke, and cup fell from the sky…”</p>

<p>Thomas hissed angrily, “Don’t you liken holy
Christian relics to some Pagan things!”</p>

<p>“Well, well. On the way out, we’ll need the
armory first. You put your iron pot on, we take horses and gallop
away.”</p>

<p>“I have to smash Baron’s head before!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll be seized. Speed is our only
rescue.”</p>

<p>“But the cup must be in his bedroom! He’s no
fool to keep it elsewhere. I’d rather die than leave it!”</p>

<p>The wonderer watched him with a strange
expression, then sighed, tossed and thrashed heavily in the stone
corner. “Man is reckless… Isn’t that a simple Truth?”</p>

<p>“Ho-ly won-de-rer!” Thomas spoke in measured
tones. He choked with fury, veins in his neck bulged, the metal
collar strangling him like Baron’s iron fingers. “Will you help
me?”</p>

<p>The wonderer had big, mild, all-forgiving
eyes. Those could belong to an icon, a righteous man close to
Christ, one of his twelve paladins. “Off chance I shan’t abandon my
search of Truth despite… In Great Reclusion, do as others do.”</p>

<p>“Will you help?” Thomas moaned.</p>

<p>“A little,” Oleg replied in a quiet voice.
“Don’t expect much.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter
3</p>

<p>All the next day Thomas stood in the full
blaze of the sun, tied to a post in the middle of the yard. His
clothes were torn off. The servants laughed, threw leftovers at
him. The burning Saracen sun was driving him mad. Bugs and flies
swarmed his bleeding wounds, his eyes, nostrils and ears, fresh
wales on his back. Thomas swore, then roared like a bull until his
voice got hoarse and his head dropped on the chest. He could only
moan then. His legs gave way, so he hung on the bounds that cut
into his flesh tightly and made it blue.</p>

<p>Oleg hoped Thomas would be brought back to
the barn, but the night came and the poor knight was still not
there. Tired stone-breakers gobbled their meal. Twice they fought
near the food caldron for a slice of meat, then everyone collapsed
on pitches of rotten hay. Soon Oleg heard snoring, rattling breath,
painful groans.</p>

<p>He listened to the sounds outside, approached
the gate. Behind those oaken folds banded with thick iron, two
soldiers had to watch all the night long. <emphasis>Baron is severe, but
are both of them actually there?</emphasis></p>

<p>Without looking at the chink between folds,
through which the iron bar could be seen, Oleg grabbed the edge
with his left hand, his right one set against the crossbeam. He
strained and began to lift the fold, his knuckles scraped against
the stone gatepost. The massive hinges creaked faintly, the gate
bar moved with a grind.</p>

<p>With gritted teeth, he bent every effort to
lift the massive fold, his eyes fixed on the glittering pole coming
out slowly of the rusty hinges. The wooden edge almost touched the
stone vault.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the pole slid out. Oleg hardly kept
the fold in hands. Holding his breath, he put it down carefully and
listened. The yard was quiet as the barn was: the heavy sleep had
overcome exhausted slaves. As a breath of fresh night air came in
through the wide slit, some of them tossed uneasily and
groaned.</p>

<p>Oleg squeezed himself quietly between the
stone wall and the fold taken off hinges. The broad courtyard
looked empty. He heard horses snort in distant stables, their
hooves knock on the wooden fence. In the moonlight he saw a
tethering post in the middle of the yard.</p>

<p>The castle had its lights on. He caught a
glimpse of a man’s figure, big and round-headed, against the
curtain in the fourth, topmost floor. In the next window, a woman’s
head was seen for a moment, her golden hair lit by a torch from
behind looked ominously red, until some long dark hands seized her
by white shoulders and pulled away. The silk curtains were drawn at
once.</p>

<p>Oleg sneaked in the shadow along the wall.
For a moment, it seemed to him that once he had been sneaking the
same way, in the same rags, emaciated…</p>

<p>He waved unnecessary thoughts away, picked a
stone, tossed it up to feel its weight, sides, roughness. The
warden’s stone hut was dark ahead, a drowsy guard sitting on the
threshold. Oleg passed by him tip-toe and climbed the wall,
clutching at the juts of rough stones.</p>

<p>On the top of the wall, he lay down, lest
they see him against the stars, listened. Finally, he heard a faint
rustle, as if a leather sole shuffled on top of the wall in three
or four steps. The sound did not repeat but Oleg had detected the
shadowed guard by it. He took the stone out, weighed it in hand. He
had never missed a mark in five steps before.</p>

<p>He ran tip-toe, making no more noise than a
moon ray, and saw the guard better: big, broad-shouldered and
young, in a glittering helmet and a mail with shimmering iron
plates. He leaned on the wall drowsily, with half-closed eyes, but
if he raised his head a bit his eyes would have met Oleg’s.</p>

<p>Oleg prepared to hurl the stone. He knew he
would not miss, but a strange weakness fettered his muscle. <emphasis>A
young man is to die… what for? Is it his fault that he’s in the way
of a runaway slave? Perhaps he’s an outlaw, the worst kind of man,
but he might just as well only happen to be here and soon leave it
for a good honest job…</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg ran to him noiselessly, tips of his toes
barely touched the stone. He punched the helmet, it crunched, the
boy went slipping down the wall. Oleg caught him, put down into the
corner. The dark blood gushed from under the helmet, spilt hot on
his hands. Oleg clenched his teeth. He did not expect this, out of
the habit to use violence in his cave. <emphasis>The lad will never come
to… I could have thrown the stone, all the same!</emphasis></p>

<p>Feeling guilty, he took the sword belt off
the body, unsheathed the knife and tucked into his belt backwards,
in Scythian way. A cloud hid the moon for a moment. He sneaked
along briskly, getting used again to the weight of sword on his
left.</p>

<p>The yard remained empty, its broad ill-fitted
paves and dented stone stairs flooded with moonlight. The walls
were formed by solid stone slabs while broken pieces were used to
cobble the courtyard. The place was all stone, from top to bottom:
the keep, walls, towers, slave cellars, even the yard…</p>

<p><emphasis>Slave cellars?</emphasis> Thomas must be in
another kind of cellar: a torture chamber. Baron must have one. All
big lords have those: open and secret, separate for common people
and nobles… <emphasis>But where is it?</emphasis></p>

<p>He stopped dead, his eyes examined the dark
stone buildings. Baron built in a hurry to fortify in the
unfriendly land, men in his stone quarry dropped like flies, but
everything is durable, made for ages… and following a familiar
pattern. According to that canon, the torture chamber was placed
straight under the keep, for the lord to visit his treasury and
cellar with his most dangerous – or expensive – prisoners without
stepping outdoors.</p>

<p>Oleg took in the castle at a glance,
estimated the thickness of walls, the location of windows and
rooms. His intuition pointed at a small guarded window at the
ground level. The yard was still empty, the moon covered by a
shaggy cloud, so he adjusted the sword belt, ran along the top of
the wall and kneeled, ready to slip down into the dark.</p>

<p>Huge inhuman hands emerged from the darkness
on his left. Oleg was late to stir away: strong fingers had grasped
his neck. He gave no cry of pain and astonishment only because his
throat was squeezed. He felt lifted up in the air. His head jerked
back almost at the point of breaking the neck. Another monstrous
hand hit Oleg’s arm, the one with the sword he managed to draw out
despite pain. The sword disappeared, with a brief flash in the
moonlight.</p>

<p>His arm got numb of the heavy blow. Through
pounding in ears, he listened to hear steel tinkle on the stone but
it was quiet as if the sword fell into a haycock. Gasping, he
grabbed the fingers on his throat but could not remove them: his
right arm was dangling. His was getting weak quickly. With a soft
growl, the monster pressed him to the tower wall. The moon came
out, and Oleg felt deadly cold, as he found himself in the grasp of
a fierce grinning troll!</p>

<p>Wheezing, Oleg kicked the tower wall to push
off. He flung away together with his enemy who stopped on the very
brisk of the wall, his foot hung off. The monstrous teeth snapped
straight before Oleg’s eyes, but the fingers unclenched: the troll
had no wish to fall down on the stones, even with prey in his
clutch. Staggering, Oleg rubbed his throat, backed two steps and
jumped down briskly on the lower cross-wall, visible in the moon
light.</p>

<p>His trembling legs failed him. He fell,
everything went dark with pain, as his injured arm was pressed
down. He rose hastily, gasping still. The troll could have killed
him from an ambush, with a sword or a hammer-like fist, but the
beast loathed people, he craved to see the agonizing face of a man
seeing his death and trembling with fear, to enjoy his agony and
terror!</p>

<p>He had barely got up when the troll jumped
down to him softly, like a giant cat, although twice as heavy as
Oleg. A curved blade glittered in his right hand. Oleg leaned
against the wall desperately: a deadlock, but the troll didn’t
raise the sword. He could hack Oleg’s head off, slash his body
slantwise or down to the waist, but that was too easy death!</p>

<p>Suddenly, Oleg grasped what the troll wanted:
to slash his belly open, guts to fall out, death be inevitable, but
last long, very long, and the victim to know it coming, to wail in
fear, to crawl, with the wet grey tangle of his entrails dragged
behind…</p>

<p>He gathered his last strength, pushed off the
stone and leapt on the troll, his right foot aimed at the sword
paw, his left one – at the groin. The troll stirred, the sword
slipped off his finders and went tinkling down the stairs, but
Oleg’s left foot missed and kicked the monster’s hip instead. The
troll reeled, his blood-colored eyes flashed like burning coals
when the wind blows ashes off them. Oleg alerted, fell on his back,
defenseless like a baby before a wolf. The troll hung over him,
huge and ferocious… and rushed for the blade.</p>

<p>The sword lay a floor below, shimmering like
a fish just out of water. The troll stooped for it. Oleg jumped
down at him, kicked his back with both feet.</p>

<p>Any man’s spine would have been broken like
an overdried splinter, but the troll only collapsed, his body
rolled a floor downstairs, with a thunder of bones. Oleg felt cold
when he saw a glitter in the black paw – the troll had seized the
sword!</p>

<p>Gasping for air, Oleg rushed back to the top
of the wall. <emphasis>The cellar where they keep Thomas is straight
beneath, but this mad beast in the way! Goodness knows how a troll
got to this southern land…</emphasis> A cloud slipped on the moon, and
everything went black. Oleg felt his back cold: he could barely
tell the narrow passage along the top of the wall apart from the
black emptiness. He clenched his fists and ran along the path. His
heart sank with every step, as he expected his foot to find
abyss…</p>

<p>The castle was an ordinary tangle of walls,
towers, stairs, and landings made for defense, good to place
catapults and blazing tar barrels at, but Oleg realized with fear
that he got lost. He ran to the corner, rounded a watchtower with a
sleeping sentinel inside and stopped, trying to figure out where he
was.</p>

<p>The clatter of troll’s sharp claws on the
stone was approaching, as the monster ran up the narrow stairs. The
sword swung in his paw, glimmering in the moonlight. His ears were
pointed and upright like a wolf’s, his big white teeth bare and
gleaming.</p>

<p>Oleg retreated until he climbed on the
observation deck, the highest point of the castle. Over the wooden
railing, he saw stars: cold, far, and prickly on the sky as dark as
sin, the ground far below in the blackness.</p>

<p>The troll sniffed, raised his head. His grin
got broader, he went upstairs in a slower pace, bending slightly: a
tight, alerted ball of bestial muscle.</p>

<p>Oleg retreated to the edge of the deck,
looked around like an animal at bay. His right arm still ached,
fingers bent poorly. The troll ascended slowly, in silence, his
eyes fixed on Oleg. The broad curved blade shared the predatory
glitter with the monster’s big teeth, the four curved jutting fangs
the brightest.</p>

<p>Oleg’s back clung fast into the corner, the
railing cracked. The troll climbed on the deck in five steps. Their
eyes met. Seeing the runaway fully in his power, the troll grinned
with malice. He made a step forward, yellow saliva foamed in the
corner of his thick lips. He watched the victim’s face with
delight. It was a helpless creature trembling before him, and he
wanted to take all the pleasure of it, to the last drop, to revel
in fear and awe before taking a life – with regret for
impossibility to kill twice, trice, many times – taking it slowly,
for the victim to see own death, inescapable and terrible…</p>

<p>The troll raised the sword in right hand, his
left one stretched aside, reaching the rails. Oleg hardly took his
eyes off the glittering blade. The troll grinned: this time no way
for his enemy to escape. Suddenly he tossed the sword to another
hand. Oleg’s heart beat faster, but then he looked in the beast’s
blazing eyes and realized: the troll has equal use of both arms, he
plays with the sword to make his prey liven up for a moment, to
plunge it into a deeper agony and terror afterwards.</p>

<p>The rails crackled under Oleg’s weight. He
felt poles moving apart. <emphasis>A moment – and I’ll fall down into the
cobbled yard.</emphasis> The troll would not kill with a sword: he’d
rather gnaw at his prey to feel warm salty blood on lips, tear the
living flesh while the prey writhes, twitches, pushes him away with
weakening fingers…</p>

<p>Oleg was fingering a rough pole behind him
when his palm found the knife hilt. He flinched. How could he have
forgotten it?</p>

<p>Trying to look petrified with fear, he pulled
the knife out cautiously, gripped the handle. The troll made one
more slow step, his gleaming red eyes almost burnt his prey
through.</p>

<p>A crow cried harshly above their heads. The
troll shot a glance at it. His eyes returned to his prey at once,
but Oleg had time to swing his hand: so fast that he saw only a
blurry move himself. The troll gurgled as if he choked with wine,
his eyes popped out. The knife was deep in his throat. His
monstrous hairy paws convulsed, the sword slipped out, struck
against the stone, bounced and stopped.</p>

<p>The troll seized the knife handle, lurched.
Oleg saw the blade, dark with blood, in the huge hand, a hole in
his throat, blood gushing out like a mountain stream, foaming and
steaming in the moonlight. The troll went staggering to Oleg, his
hand with the knife advanced, his eyes such a bright blaze that
Oleg could see nothing but those red fires.</p>

<p>Keeping an eye on the troll, Oleg picked the
sword, jumped into the corner. For a moment they stood, devouring
each other with eyes. Oleg raised the sword: heavy, sharp, with a
curved blade. The troll reeled but kept walking, a knife in his
hand stretched far ahead. He was wild, wheezing, covered with
blood.</p>

<p>Oleg did not strike – the troll collapsed at
his feet, sprawled like a cut-down tree.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Thomas hung in his chains, feeble and
half-conscious, when he heard the door bar click, then a soft
whisper: “Sir Thomas! Don’t sock me on head!”</p>

<p>A familiar figure slipped into, setting the
door ajar. Thomas jerked his head up, peered at the wonderer,
unable to believe his eyes: Oleg had a sword on his belt and a
knife in hand. He stopped in the middle of the torture chamber,
giving his eyes time to accommodate to the fading light of the only
torch. “Oh… <emphasis>You</emphasis> seem to have been socked.”</p>

<p>He approached, seized the hooks on which the
tormented knight was hanging. The muscle bulged on his shoulders.
Oleg sniffed, pulled – and the iron pin creaked out of the wall.
Thomas could not believe his eyes, but the wonderer, breathing
heavily near his left ear, tugged another pin – and Thomas was
free.</p>

<p>The small room smelled of burning, the air
was stiff. A wall was covered with hooks, pincers, saws, iron rods
used to pierce a leg through, special tongs for tooth wrenching and
lip ripping. The corner housed a small forge and a pile of
firewood. Wincing, Thomas rubbed his swollen wrists. “Was there a
guard?”</p>

<p>“There is,” the wonderer said in a dull,
almost sleepy voice. He did not seem to mind the thick iron ring
chaffing his neck. The deeply curved writing on it, visible in the
semi-dark, said the slave belonged to Baron Otset. Oleg looked
around the chamber sadly. A bunch of keys that had once been on the
jailer’s belt jingled in hand. “Can you walk?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“My bones intact,” Thomas informed bitterly,
with waking hope in his voice. “I’m burnt and beaten, that’s all. I
only mind I didn’t hit back this time!” He snatched at his slave
collar violently: that damned thing was burning him days and
nights.</p>

<p>The wonderer glanced back at him from the
door. Thomas followed him out, screwing of bright light: there were
two torches lit in the passage. The wonderer glided along as a
shadow. On the go he threw the bunch of keys under a heavy gate,
with a wide stream of sewage running out from under it. There was a
startled cry, a trample of bare feet.</p>

<p>“Runaway slaves there,” Thomas explained
unnecessarily. “You knew it?”</p>

<p>“It’s the same everywhere. All the same…”</p>

<p>Thomas struggled to keep up but suddenly
checked himself. “Wait! We won’t get out! At night the yard is
guarded by a troll. I don’t know where he came from…”</p>

<p>“You could have warned before,” the wonderer
grumbled. “His watch has ended.”</p>

<p>Thomas sneaked after him, clutching at the
wall. The answer puzzled him. He could barely keep up with Oleg:
stiff legs were reluctant to obey.</p>

<p>“Let’s go to stables,” the wonderer said.
They stopped. “Your horse is there.”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave the cup!” Thomas replied,
looking aside.</p>

<p>The wonderer shrugged indifferently. “Hurry
then. Dawn’s at hand.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll move on my way with a prayer. Fights
and bloodshed are none of my business.”</p>

<p>The corridor curved. In twenty steps there
was a massive door to the courtyard. Beside it, a bulky soldier sat
on a keg, his back rested on the wall. His helmet, iron plates on
his shoulders and knees, and the broad blade of his axe were
gleaming red in the torchlight. Sometimes his red lips opened
sleepily, but the guard stirred at once, cast a suspicious look
around, and got drowsy again. His black hair was shoulder-long. He
had a thick leather armor under his iron plates, an axe across his
laps, a gleaming shield leaned against the wall next to him.</p>

<p>Hiding in the shadow, they watched him.
Thomas clenched and unclenched his fists. “If I got this bumpkin…
But he’ll bellow as a bull before I reach him!”</p>

<p>With obvious displeasure on his face, the
wonderer pulled his knife out, took it by sharp point, as if to
weigh it, then by handle. Thomas watched in confusion. The wonderer
swung, his hand made a sudden brief and swift move. A faint
lightning flashed in the smoky air along the corridor, died out at
once. The sleeping guard stopped quivering, his head dropped, his
chin set against his chest.</p>

<p>Thomas snatched the sword from the wonderer’s
hand, rushed forward. The knife was stuck in the guard’s head
beside ear, two thin dark trickles running down. The wonderer
pulled the knife out on the run, picked the guard’s axe. He stopped
at the door, wiped the bloody blade with a cloth. “We get out?”</p>

<p>Thomas hardly took his astonished eyes from
the pilgrim’s pale face. “What? Ah! The armory must be on the
right, sir wonderer.”</p>

<p>“Been there?”</p>

<p>“No. But if <emphasis>I</emphasis> were building…”</p>

<p>The armory door was in ten steps, guarded by
two men. Thomas noticed that the wonderer clenched his fists
powerlessly and whispered something of no more killing, please, for
we are all strangers in the night, or some nonsense like that.</p>

<p>The guard seated on a wooden block was
dozing, his legs jerked. Another one was walking to and fro,
yawning, rubbing his eyes with fists.</p>

<p>The sitting guard gave a loud snore, his legs
stretched across the passage. Irritated, his partner intended to
kick him, but the sleeping man looked like a bull, so the guard
thought better and went away to the opposite wall, with a small
guarded window in it. He jumped, grabbed the rods with both hands
and pulled his face up to the fresh air jet.</p>

<p>“Day is breaking,” the guard said, then
jumped down and turned. He saw a flash, a violent blow shook his
body. Oleg caught him in the fall, put on the floor gently. He felt
a draught, as Thomas galloped by like a horse. There came a thump,
as if a log were axed.</p>

<p>Oleg flung the armory door open, glanced back
at Thomas with reproach. The knight’s eyes glittered with joy. “Why
kill him?” Oleg spoke sadly. “He’s no enemy.”</p>

<p>“And what <emphasis>you</emphasis> did?” Thomas
wondered.</p>

<p>“Just stunned.”</p>

<p>“That’s why his brain splashed on walls!”</p>

<p>The armory was a big room with low ceiling,
full of trunks, chests, sabers, daggers and other weapons. Along
the walls, there were shields, pieces of armor, and flexible lines
of riveted steel, all lying in heaps. Small mail rings shimmered
like fish, dusty helmets stood in a row like overturned pots.</p>

<p>Thomas rushed into the far corner, rummaged
there avidly, scattering the pieces. “That’s my armor!” he
whispered.</p>

<p>His hands were trembling, his blue eyes in
tears. He hurried to pull the heavy steel on, his fingers slid off.
“Sir wonderer,” he begged in a whisper. “Don’t take it as
impudence… Please help me with clasps on my back! The knight’s
trouble is that sometimes he can’t array himself in!”</p>

<p>In a moment, a half-naked stonemason with an
angry face was concealed within the gleaming steel. The armor was
fitting but the slave collar did not want to go inside, Thomas
pushed it in with a fist. His blue eyes looked at Oleg through a
narrow slit, the rest of his body covered with iron.</p>

<p>Thomas stooped easily – pieces of his armor
slid apart in particular places to allow it – seized his triangle
shield, snatched the cross-handled sword from the wall. “Forgive
me, sir wonderer. Though you are no highborn but not a servant
either. I shouldn’t have asked you to clasp me as if you were a
squire…”</p>

<p>“Stop it,” the wonderer winced. “You’d better
hurry. Do you hear it?”</p>

<p>There was a noise in the yard: clamor,
furious barking of dogs, then a desperate squeal. “Slaves picked
the keys,” Oleg said. “It took them so much time… Now they’ll smash
and plunder all around, break into the wine cellar… That will
distract the guards.”</p>

<p>They hurried up the steep stairs, climbed on
an open landing. It was dark below, the night ripped by torchlight,
clang of steel, and shouts of men, but the sky was going lighter,
stars fading. They felt a cool morning breeze.</p>

<p>They saw a watchtower on the left and the
wall stretching along from it. In three or four steps, there was a
lower wall fencing a corner off the yard. A guard in light armor
was walking on the top of that wall, his cold hands under his arms,
a sword and a knife on his belt. He cast uncaring glances below,
where the torchlights rushed and men shouted.</p>

<p>Thomas cursed: the guard was unattainable on
that side-by-side wall. The soldier raised his head and saw an
armored knight and a half-naked man, lean but broad-shouldered,
both with swords. His eyes popped out, his chest started rising, as
he took in the air for a loud cry.</p>

<p>Thomas felt some hot thing rush past him. The
next moment, he saw the wonderer pouncing upon the guard: he jumped
legs first, and they crossed around the soldier’s neck with such
strength that Thomas heard the crunch of broken bones. Both slid
down the wall: the guard with his eyes popped and the half-naked
man on his shoulders. At the last moment, the wonderer clutched at
the wall edge. His legs came apart, the limp dead body slipped
down.</p>

<p>Thomas could hardly believe his eyes: he had
never seen such a fight practice. He heard a faint slap below, as
if a sack of wet linen were thrown down on cobbles. The wonderer
pulled himself up the wall, shook his fist at Thomas: “Damn you,
knight! I don’t stop killing!”</p>

<p>“How’d you get back here?” Thomas cried
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m not going to!” Oleg shouted back
angrily. “I’m going to stables, to horses. And you want Baron? His
chambers are just beneath you!” He rushed along the wall to the
stairs that led down into the yard.</p>

<p>Thomas came to his senses, chose the shortest
cut, although dodging and twisting, built in a way to help defend
the castle. He ran by the inclined edge. Men in the yard below
cried louder with joy, torchlights rushed faster. He heard a crack
of wood, a clang of steel.</p>

<p>A guard, as lanky as a milestone, stood
half-asleep beside an ornate door. He raised a gleaming spear.
Thomas crushed him with a brisk strike of gauntleted fist, thrust
the door with his shoulder. The wood cracked, the massive bar flew
off its hinges with an ear-grating screech of iron, the folds flung
open.</p>

<p>Thomas broke into the ornate room as an
avalanche. It was a bedroom, as large as a hall, low-vaulted, lit
by a huge fireplace that could burn a whole tree. A crooked old man
was sitting beside the fire, throwing thick billets in it. In the
middle of the room, there was a high bed covered with a bright
canopy and curtained by silk.</p>

<p>Running across the bedroom, Thomas tore the
bed curtains away, then stopped and turned, his sword and shield
ready for battle. On the two puffy pillows of the luxurious bed, he
saw two heads: one female, her golden hair lit the room when Thomas
ripped the curtain away, and one male, black as a firebrand and big
as a caldron.</p>

<p>Baron was asleep, his mighty arms stretched
behind his head. He had a tiny forehead, overhanging brows, a short
flattened nose with huge nostrils, and a heavy back-slanted jaw.
Thomas felt something odd in his face but he had no time to think
it over: Baron turned in his sleep, his nails scratched his strong
chest with black bestial hair. The blanket slipped off, and the
nightgown on the golden-haired woman opened wide. Thomas started
back, blurred by the tender whiteness of her skin. He had time to
see her alabaster breast, perfect in shape, crowned with a
bright-red rose bud.</p>

<p>She woke up, her blue innocent eyes opened
wide in astonishment, as well as her small coral mouth. Amazed, she
looked into the eyes of the same blue that watched her through a
narrow visor slit.</p>

<p>Thomas struggled to take his eyes off her.
His fury, which had been boiling up for all the days of his
shameful captivity, nearly leaked down all into some folds and
cracks of his soul.</p>

<p>He grabbed Baron’s naked shoulder, squeezed
it with gauntleted hand. “Get up! The Hell’s tired waiting.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter
4</p>

<p>Baron turned his head quickly, took in the
room in a tenacious glance. Thomas swayed his sword ominously,
throwing crimson lights into Baron’s eyes. On the wall behind
Thomas, there hung a huge axe with fanciful hooks on butt. The old
man raked billets in the burning fireplace. He was shaking, despite
sitting near the fire. He paid no attention to Thomas, nor to his
master.</p>

<p>Thomas caught Baron’s look and nodded: “Take
it!”</p>

<p>Baron stood upright: dark, massive, covered
with hair like a forest animal. Thomas noticed something odd again,
his heart was wrung with alarm. Baron’s legs were too short, his
arms huge and muscular, a strange head seated straight on his
sloping shoulders… “And the rest?” Baron bellowed.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced around. <emphasis>Baron’s armor must
be in another room.</emphasis> <emphasis>Send him for it – and he’ll bring a
dozen of guards!</emphasis> “No,” Thomas said and lifted his sword.</p>

<p>Baron roared, tried to run away through the
smashed door, but Thomas brandished his sword and nearly slashed
the enemy’s side open. With a creepy howl, Baron snatched the axe
from the wall, wheeled round abruptly to the armored knight.</p>

<p>He hold the axe with both hands at the knee
level, his eyes fixed on the unexpected foe. Thomas suddenly felt
weak: Baron’s eyes had no pupils, no irises, but they were not all
white as a blind man’s – they were fiery red! Their blood-colored
light was going brighter, blazing up as if the Hell’s fire, from
which this monster had emerged, shone through his skull.</p>

<p>“You die!” Baron roared with a creepy move of
his jaw: it was getting heavier before Thomas’s eyes, transforming,
covering with a bony shell.</p>

<p>“All men die,” Thomas replied as firmly as he
could, while his voice tried to break into a frightened squeal.
“But you – now.”</p>

<p>He brandished the sword. Baron raised his
axe, parried a blow. The sword blade hit the axe handle. Thomas
expected the sword to cut it as a twig, to slash the beast down to
the waist, but the blade bounced off. Thomas’s hands were burnt
with sharp pain. He heard a roaring laughter – the axe handle had
only the looks of wood – and fell on his back to dodge a blow.</p>

<p>In the host of Duke Gottfried, Thomas was the
only knight who could in his full armor fall on his back, roll over
his head, and get up to his feet. This skill saved his life again.
The dreadful axe blade cut the air so close to his face that Thomas
felt the wind. Baron stepped forward in a haste to finish his enemy
off while he was down. If he knew Thomas, he could have done it in
time – but he didn’t, and Thomas stood upright, breathing heavily.
His shield remained on the floor, and Thomas kicked it aside,
gripped the long sword hilt with both hands. His eyes, also
burning, were fixed on Baron.</p>

<p>Their eyes met in a fierce duel: bright blue,
burning with the bitter cold of icy North, against red inhuman…
Baron’s body was transforming: his shoulders got even broader and
stronger, his mouth turned into dreadful jaws. They opened, four
hideous fangs came out. The monster breathed heavily, as if he, not
Thomas, had been running in heavy armor. Thomas heard ferocious
shouts from the yard, steel clanking and clanging, horses
neighing.</p>

<p>“Die,” the turnskin croaked. He went to
Thomas, shifting his axe between hands. It had a long sharp double
hook on the butt, a jagged spear blade on its back. They clashed.
Thomas shuddered: the troll’s face, covered with black hair, was
close, with its wide wrenched nostrils and crimson eyes under the
thick bone cornice. The turnskin’s sharp-toothed jaws opened wide.
Thomas shrunk back and that saved him: huge teeth clanged near his
visor, all but snapped at it. Thomas pushed away with the handle,
felt muscle hard as wood under the troll’s thick hair.</p>

<p>Troll brought his axe down, aiming at the
shiny helmet. Thomas parried, but his arms went numb of a terrible
blow, he barely kept his feet. The woman sat up on the bed, her
eyes wide open in silent astonishment, her gaze shifting between
the armored knight and the troll, as though choosing the one to
stake on. Thomas retreated, struggling to parry the violent blows,
each one almost knocking the sword out of numb fingers. The troll
howled, breathed heavily, his sharp-pointed ears moved like an
animal’s.</p>

<p>The flames in the fireplace blazed up. The
old man poked them, almost falling face first into the fire.
Trembling, he shoved his hands now in his bosom, now straight into
the fire. His flabby neck got covered with goose bumps. He never
looked back, though Thomas and the troll all but stumbled over his
hunched figure, cast mighty clanging hand-numbing blows just over
his head.</p>

<p>Thomas clenched his teeth – it was shameful
and dangerous to retreat – and lunged. The troll parried only half
of the unexpected blow. The sword point stabbed his face near the
eyebrow, slashed his cheek down in two. Blood gushed out
forcefully, the troll started back, apparently stunned: the sword
had slashed his thick eyebrow bone. The huge hand jerked up to wipe
the blood. Hastily, Thomas struck twice. The troll staggered but
blunted his attacks, the axe handle in both hands. Thomas slashed
quickly, with all his strength, giving time to recover – but the
foe <emphasis>was</emphasis> recovering. The crimson blaze in his eyes turned
acid yellow.</p>

<p>The troll snarled hoarsely, his breath stinky
and husky, his enormous fangs glittering. Suddenly he gripped the
blunt end of the axe with both hands. The flash of steel seemed to
have lit the whole room. The blow was dreadful, irresistible.
Thomas did not try to parry: he simply stepped to the left at the
last moment. With a smack, the blade hacked handle-deep into the
oaken floor. Thomas cast a mighty blow with the sword in both hands
like a spear. The sword point pierced the troll’s skin, as thick as
a double-leather armor, the blade went two palms deep into the
flesh.</p>

<p>The castle shuddered of the terrible roar. A
shield dropped from the wall, huge antlers fell besides. The flames
clung to the coals in fear, the woman stood straight. The troll
bent with pain, the sword handle was pulled out from Thomas’s
hands.</p>

<p>Thomas backed hastily, glanced around but saw
nothing to use as a weapon nearby. The troll’s yellow eyes, blazing
with fury, were fixed on him. The sword was stuck in his side as
though in wood! The troll pulled the axe handle and twisted: it had
stuck too deeply. He pulled with all his might. The thick black
blood finally gushed from his wound, fizzing, foaming, falling his
thick hair as a wind falls trees. The axe was still there. The
troll set his foot firmly, gave a dreadful roar. Monstrous muscles
bulged on his back, the blade screeched, coming out from the thick
wood, and the axe was in the troll’s hands!</p>

<p>Thomas backed until his back touched the
wall. He was shaking. The dreadful troll was coming on him, raising
his axe for the final blow. The sword, still stuck in his side,
leaned to the floor, barely keeping in, blood gushed over the
handle and down by the blade. A trail of bloody inhuman footprints
was left behind.</p>

<p>His dreadful eyes looked at Thomas, blazing
with terrible white fire. Monstrous arms lifted the heavy ax
overhead. Thomas sprawled on the wall. He could not take his eyes
off the monster’s ones – and those suddenly darkened, red sparkles
disseminating quickly in the black. The axe slipped off, hit the
troll’s head with its butt, and thundered down on the stone. The
troll reeled forward. Thomas had barely moved away when the huge
bestial body collapsed on the wall. The troll’s claws scratched
deep furrows in the stone, he slid down to the floor.</p>

<p>Thomas seized the sword handle briskly, his
palm felt hot and sticky. He set his foot against the massive body
and pulled. The sword came out easily as if pushed away by a hot
spurt of blood. Thomas wiped the blade on the hairy back as clean
as he could. The troll was still twitching, all four paws scratched
the stone floor with a creepy sound.</p>

<p>Thomas heard an astonished voice: “I’d have
never believed it!”</p>

<p>The woman jumped off the bed, a white
kerchief with a golden monogram fluttering in hand, like a scared
butterfly. Thomas stood like a statue, with the blooded sword. She
shoved the kerchief into his trembling hands, threw her arms around
his head, snuggled up to him, frightened, tender like a morning
breeze, like a light cloud. Thomas dropped his sword, stood there
like a fool, not daring to stain the kerchief, though she gave it
for him to wipe the blood off his fingers. He felt a keen regret
that his iron armor was between their bodies.</p>

<p>Shivering, she clung to him so forcefully
that she could have knocked Thomas down if he was not pressed to
the wall. Hating his armor, Thomas muttered with embarrassment,
“You are free, my lady!”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, thank you very much indeed, my
miraculous rescuer!”</p>

<p>“Please don’t look at the beast. Such a
terrible sight for you…”</p>

<p>She embraced his neck with her sugar-white
hands, raised her pretty head. Her beautiful face, shining with
hope, was just before Thomas’s eyes, her eyes glimmered with
happiness. Her voice was so tender and melodious that his heart
ached: “It’s awful! I did not know he was mortal. When he slew my
husband, Baron Otset, and took his appearance… A monster! False
damned monster! He deceived me. I was always deceived, by everyone!
Baron lied…”</p>

<p>“A monster,” Thomas muttered. The sword
dropped from his hand again, his muscle relaxed. He embraced the
tender woman’s shoulders clumsily, fearing to stain her golden hair
with blood. “But now he’s dead.”</p>

<p>“My dear Baron,” she whispered. Her
magnificent blue eyes looked in the narrow slit of his helmet with
a plead. “I mean, my mysterious knight! You won’t leave a weak
woman without protection, will you?”</p>

<p>“My honor can’t allow it!” Thomas replied
with knightly ardor. “Just your word – and I’ll do everything for
you not to worry!”</p>

<p>Her beautiful arms were still around him, her
high breasts waved, being pressed to his steel armor. “Your
nobility has… won me!” she exclaimed with emotion. “And my castle
with its lands, stone quarries and slaves in addition. Behind
Baron… the last and the one before him… I felt safe as behind a
stone wall. But now I’m so afraid, so alone! You must become my new
stone wall, brave knight! A wall behind which my faint scared heart
will find refuge!”</p>

<p>Thomas opened his mouth and closed it, blood
pounded louder in his temples. He heard a distant ringing in ears.
Her deep pupils were expanding, filling all the world. He felt
dimly that her tender hands pulled the helmet off his head neatly,
her deft fingers unclasped the broad steel plates, drawing the
mighty but rigid knight out of his armor, like a shelled
oyster.</p>

<p>Thomas tried to shake the overcoming weakness
off. He was not only weary after a hard battle: some strange
sluggishness added to it. His thoughts were in a mess (maybe a
consequence of the header). Her immense begging eyes screened all
the world off. His lungs were crackling, he coughed, spat out a
clot of blood. He felt a stitch in his side as if an arrowhead
stuck there. Thomas had a vague memory of the hard blow landed
there. His armor endured, but a couple of ribs might have broken
like straws.</p>

<p>Far away, there were voices, the crash of the
furniture turned upside down. The sound of heavy footsteps
approached, the bedroom door cracked open on its single hinge.
Thomas heard a loud indignant cry: “I thought him dead! And he’s –
what a shame! – pleasing his insatiate lust!”</p>

<p>He caught a glimpse of the wonderer’s angry
face in the mist. Oleg was grim as a black rock, his eyes
unfriendly, his breath fast. He had a two-handed sword, as large as
a beam, in his hands, its point rested against the floor.</p>

<p>Thomas stirred. Being very weak, he felt some
unusual, scary lightness in his body. His foot stumbled over a heap
of armor. With slack surprise, he recognized his breastplate, shin
plates, his helmet… He found himself sitting on the floor, his head
on the woman’s knees. Baroness fingered his hair tenderly, stroked
his head. The fireplace was bursting with flames, the air as hot
and dry as a blow of simoom, the terrible hurricane of Saracen
deserts. The shouts of fury and clang of steel were coming from
outside, through the windows.</p>

<p>Thomas heard an icy cold voice over his head,
an arrogant voice, full of great contempt: “Get out, slave! Or my
husband, the lord of the castle, will rise and kill you!”</p>

<p>The wonderer looked with confusion at the
motionless troll who sprawled his four paws in a huge puddle of
blood: “I think he’ll rise when pigs get wings.”</p>

<p>“It’s the former,” Baroness said coldly. “And
the present lord is here! He’s fierce and merciless.”</p>

<p>The wonderer moved his heavy rocks of
shoulders and backed. “Well, if that’s the turn of it…”</p>

<p>Thomas gathered the last of his strength to
croak, “Sir wonderer… wait. Horses…”</p>

<p>The wonderer stopped in the doorway. The door
was still swinging on a single hinge, squealing like a knife
scratching a pan. “What?”</p>

<p>“Help!” Thomas moaned.</p>

<p>The wonderer came back, touched the knight’s
forehead, gave an anxious whistle. Thomas felt his strong fingers
behind ears, on the back of the head, then a stitch in the bridge
of the nose. Suddenly he felt a huge load taken off, no more warm
dampness inside. His eyesight cleared, he saw distinctly the alarm
in wonderer’s eyes, his compressed lips.</p>

<p>Baroness seized his legs, trying to keep him.
With great difficulty, Thomas drew aside her beautiful snow-white
hands, for the only touch of which other knights would give their
lives. He got up, lurched. The wonderer watched, with a sullen
approval, the knight climb into his rumpled armor like an old ill
turtle.</p>

<p>“My lord!” the young Baroness cried, her
marvelous eyes filled with tears. “You’re exhausted. You’ve slain
the monster…”</p>

<p>Thomas dressed as fast as he could, puffing
and panting. The wonderer supported him by shoulders, clasped his
back, pulled, pushed and tapped – and Thomas found himself inside
the armor. At once he felt clad and protected, comfortable with the
heavy steel on his shoulders.</p>

<p>He heaved the sword up from the puddle of
black blood. As against the sword in the wonderer’s hands, it
looked like a dagger.</p>

<p>The wonderer waved to him from near the
window: “We’ll have to go through back chambers!”</p>

<p>“Slaves got into?” Thomas asked dully. He
shot an embarrassed glance at the golden-haired Baroness. “We can’t
allow… They’ll rape…”</p>

<p>“Slaves are far. Guards are retreating to the
gate. A dozen of those mugs will be there soon, and I hate it when
people fight like animals.” He backed from the window, ominous
crimson lights danced on his face. They heard shouts of triumph and
screams of agony from outside, the crackle of burning
buildings.</p>

<p>Thomas turned to Baroness: “Where’s the
cup?”</p>

<p>“Which?” she asked, her beautiful eyebrows
raised very high. “I have many cups. Baron brought them from
everywhere. And the previous Baron… And the one before him…”</p>

<p>The wonderer turned around. “<emphasis>This</emphasis> cup
came by itself,” he snapped angrily. “Speak, woman!”</p>

<p>Baroness straightened up with an arrogant
look. Her long eyelashes flew up. “Am I not protected by a brave
knight, a slayer to monster? <emphasis>A knight</emphasis>, though he wears a
collar of my slave?”</p>

<p>Thomas coughed. “Sir wonderer. You’re
speaking to a highborn lady.”</p>

<p>The wonderer winced as if he drank some apple
vinegar. “Sort it out as you like. I’ve left the horses near the
tower wall. If you want to get out safe – come with me. Otherwise
I’m leaving alone.”</p>

<p>Thomas trailed behind Oleg miserably. There
was a fight at the stairs, a floor below: a rush of heads,
glittering blades, stakes and axes. Men shouted, steel clanged,
wounded ones uttered terrible screams.</p>

<p>The wonderer all but dragged the knight.
Suddenly Thomas stopped, raised his visor. His face was pallid,
eyes shone like stars. “It was not my life I wanted to save! You
know.”</p>

<p>“A cup dearer than life?” the wonderer
blurted in astonishment.</p>

<p>“Many things are dearer than life. Honor.
Nobility. Fidelity. Even love. Run, sir wonderer! You’ve amazed me,
I’d have never thought… I owe my life to you twice. I’m sorry I
can’t pay back… I’m staying. Even if I die.”</p>

<p>“Honor and fidelity – I know the meaning of
it. But… a cup?”</p>

<p>“Not a plain cup.”</p>

<p>With a strange expression, the wonderer
watched the doomed knight leave for the bedroom. The glittering
figure passed through the doorway and vanished, leaving a track of
blood drops from his sword point. Oleg heard a mighty roar swell at
the stairs. The last defender gave a plaintive cry, and slaves
rushed up, their bare backs glistening. Few of them had swords or
daggers – most brandished picks, crowbars, stakes, and hammers
wildly. Even the handles were stained with blood.</p>

<p>The wonderer clenched his teeth, gave a heavy
sigh. His legs moved apart into a fighting stance themselves. He
took the sword with both hands and began to wait.</p>

<p>Thomas ran out, clasping a leather bag to his
breast, the bare sword in other hand. His visor was down, so Oleg
could not see the knight’s face. Blood was streaming down his
armor. He jumped over dead bodies, stumbled over a wounded man who
tried to crawl. “Slaves here too… They’ve broken into the bedroom
from another side to rape Baroness.”</p>

<p>“And you protected her with all your
might?”</p>

<p>“Er… It was before I found the cup! I killed
three…”</p>

<p>The wonderer winced. “Wasn’t that a
haste?”</p>

<p>“I slashed the third, then saw displeasure in
her face and doubted… Where are horses?”</p>

<p>“Castle is butchered and plundered all over.
Some crossbowmen barricaded themselves in a tower, shooting
everyone. If we run across the yard, we’ll get set with their bolts
as hedgehogs with spines. Can you climb down the wall in your
steel?”</p>

<p>“Better than a monkey!” Thomas assured and
ran after the wonderer. Oleg rushed along the corridors, upstairs,
and across the rooms briskly as if he knew the castle well.</p>

<p>Slaves tore expensive curtains, crushed
furniture with axes. Once the wonderer rushed across the burning
floor, vanished in the smoke for a moment. Thomas speeded up in
fear to get lost. When they ran out onto the wall top, the sky was
shining blue, a lone small cloud blazing with orange, but the yard
was lit by the crimson light of great fires burning the furniture
and rich clothes thrown from inside. The servants squealed
terribly, as the blood-mad slaves butchered them for being
well-fed, sleeping near warm caldrons in kitchens, spared of the
draining work in the stone pit.</p>

<p>A rope fixed between the merlons hung down
from the wall. Two horses stood tethered to a tree near the castle.
Some half-naked men were running to them, attracted by the dense
smoke and shouts from the castle.</p>

<p>Thomas swore, pushed the wonderer aside and
started to descend. He caught hold of the rope deftly with his
gauntlets and legs, slipped down quickly, slowed his slide before
the very ground. When Oleg descended after him – slower, lest he
scrap his hands – the knight was rushing to the horses, shouting
and brandishing his sword.</p>

<p>The common men stopped, took a fast council
and rounded the dangerous knight, making their way to the castle
gate. Thomas turned to the wonderer and pointed at the rope. “We’d
rather take it. A useful thing in journey.”</p>

<p>“A thrifty man,” said Oleg with surprise.
“Come on, I’ve fetched two. If you need one to hang yourself, let
me know.”</p>

<p>Thomas untethered his horse. The stallion
sniffed him and snorted happily. Thomas seemed to see the sparkles
of pride in the horse’s eyes when he smelled blood on his armor.
His destrier preferred the blow of war trumpets to the sounds of
lute. <emphasis>The blow for attack, for a heavy mass of armored chivalry
to gallop forward, stirrup by stirrup, crushing all in its
way!</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg jumped on the horseback easily. Thomas
made a notch in memory: to find out where the wonderer had learnt
to mount that way, touching neither the stirrup nor the rein. And
where, in which cave or desert, what holy spirits taught him to
throw a knife that accurate, to wield a huge two-handed sword? He
<emphasis>did</emphasis> wield it, not simply brandished like a furious cook
brandishes a knife. It took Thomas, a professional warrior, just a
glance to tell a skilled fighter apart from… others.</p>

<p>The knight galloped, heavy and still, the
lance in his right hand, as usual, his visor up. He looked askew at
the wonderer who drove the horse with legs, as wild Scythians do,
with no touch to the reins. He did not bend down to hide from the
wind, his face motionless, his look vacant. Was he still searching
for the Truth? Thinking of the high? Anyway, he had not forgotten
to take both the lance for the knight and a fine lamellate bow for
himself. <emphasis>Though the bow of English yeoman is no worse, it is
tall as a man or even taller. And this lamellate bow can be shot
from horseback – by the one who’s strong enough to draw it. That
requires great strength indeed.</emphasis></p>

<p>On the left of his saddle, the wonderer had a
wide quiver stuffed with long white-feathered arrows, its silk
laces shining in the sun. The covered axe hung near it. His boots
held in the wide stirrups as though poured into.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said. He reined the
warhorse up, making him take a slower pace. “What can you do
else?”</p>

<p>The wonderer looked confused. Thomas hurried
to correct himself, “In the war craft, I mean. I see you’re
thinking about the high, but the noble art of war is also ranked
high in our world!”</p>

<p>“The world is cruel and stupid, alas. It
still is.”</p>

<p>“What do minstrels sing about if not feats of
arms?” Thomas cried in surprise. “If not battle and fight? What are
heroes born to if not fight and die with glory?”</p>

<p>The wonderer shook his head and gave no
reply. His stallion was as huge as the one under Thomas but the
knight remembered the great effort it took him to break the horse
in, while the wonderer’s destrier walked as meek as a lamb. He only
looked at his rider askew with fear. <emphasis>I heard Scythians can
squeeze with their knees so forcefully that a horse falls dead with
broken ribs. Can those rumors be true?</emphasis></p>

<p>“The Hellenes,” Thomas began, trying to get
the wonderer talking, “knew only chariots. The first time they saw
men ahorse, they took those people, Tauric Slavs, for fairy
creatures – half a man, half a horse. And gave them a name of
centaurs, or riding Taurs… Those were said to be good shooters at
full tilt!”</p>

<p>The wonderer gave him a sidelong look. “Is
there any food in your bag?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Nothing but the cup,” Thomas replied, upset.
“So what?”</p>

<p>The wonderer seized the bow from his shoulder
instantly. The white feathering flashed. At once, Thomas heard a
ringing click. The wonderer hung the bow back without expression.
Only then did petrified Thomas look where the arrow had darted
to.</p>

<p>In forty steps ahead on the roadside, a big
hare was thrashing, its body pierced through. Still not believing
his eyes, Thomas overrode the wonderer, picked the hare up with the
lance point. The wonderer, with the same still face, stretched his
arm. Thomas pulled the arrow out briskly, wiped it clean from blood
and handed to him respectfully. “I’ll skin it myself at the halt,
holy father! Er… sir wonderer! Christian faith is certainly the
truest one, but Paganism seems to have some good things too…”</p>

<p>The wonderer smirked out of the corner of his
mouth and said nothing.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter
5</p>

<p>By noon, they entered a small village. The
wonderer rode up to a remote house reeking of soot, burnt iron and
rust. A strong, sturdy man came out to meet them, his leather apron
in burnt holes. Oleg, staying in his saddle, asked, “Can you shoe a
horse and unclench two iron rings?”</p>

<p>The man glowered at him. “I’ll have to make
fire again…”</p>

<p>“That’s a pity,” Oleg said sincerely. “I
thought you’d make use of two gold coins…”</p>

<p>The man wheeled round to the house, bellowed
so loud that horses laid back their ears in fright: “Varnak,
Boldyr! Warm the forge up, fast! Sharpen some nails!”</p>

<p>Oleg jumped off the horse. Thomas smirked
understandingly, dismounted and gave the reins to the children that
came running. The village smith had many children: some of them
made the fire, others unsaddled and watered the horses, while his
wife hastened to pluck a goose</p>

<p>The blacksmith’s eyes widened when he saw the
collar on the noble knight’s neck, but he said nothing. Wielding
his chisel and tongs quickly and skillfully, he unclenched the
damned rings and threw them on burning coals to melt. <emphasis>No trace
of us if Baron’s overseers come to question.</emphasis> Oleg tossed two
gold coins in his palm. The smith thanked and dropped them on the
sooty anvil. It looked accidental. Then he smiled, put coins into
his purse accurately.</p>

<p>Oleg smirked. “Different things happen?”</p>

<p>The smith shook his head in distress. “You
won’t believe it, good man! Each summer I got foisted twice or
trice: gold or silver turns dry leaves the next day! That was until
I knew no magic can stand iron and began to drop coins on my anvil…
I’ve already caught a fraud. That fool swore he was duped himself.
Maybe that wasn’t a lie. If he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a wizard, why he did
nothing when I… er… taught him a lesson?”</p>

<p>When he fixed a loose horseshoe, Oleg gave
him one more golden coin. They rode away at once, the goose in
their bag, in a hurry to get as far from the castle as
possible.</p>

<p>The scorching sun was in zenith. The road
meandered: beaten, trampled in the dry solid ground many centuries
ago. Once it would have to round hills, turn to cities and groves,
but as the ages passed, the cities had been ruined and groves cut
down, so only the hills remained, though subsided of age. The road
was making its way among ancient ruins. Some boulders, whitened of
wind and heat, had rolled down onto the roadside.</p>

<p>“What is that wooden necklace on you?” Thomas
asked curiously. “You keep touching it, as if afraid to get it
filched.”</p>

<p>“My charms are not a necklace,” the wonderer
said without turning his head.</p>

<p>“Charms? Do you charm with them?”</p>

<p>“Through them, I hear gods give advice.”</p>

<p>Thomas laughed. “And I hear none!”</p>

<p>“Really? I hear a gang of brigands dividing
their loot in that grove. And farther across the forest, there’s a
village where we’ll find a shelter for night.”</p>

<p>Thomas gave him a skeptical look. “The
village… you may have been there before. But the brigands… Well,
let’s chop them up like cabbages!”</p>

<p>The wonderer winced, replied with disgust,
“Can’t do without fight? We’ll better round them.”</p>

<p>He turned onto a side path to a grove. Thomas
followed reluctantly. His stallion tossed his head up, snorted in
excitement. Thomas shared his delight when he heard a small stream
tinkle ahead. They broke through thick shrubs and saw a spring – a
small lake, not larger than a knight’s shield, surrounded by fresh,
sappy green grass. A spurt of water was rising in the middle of the
sandy bottom. The grits of sand whirled, spun round and sunk,
forming a smooth round rampart that could belong to a tiny
castle.</p>

<p>The wonderer unsaddled the horses and started
gathering brushwood. Thomas considered skinning a hare to be a more
noble affair than that, so he skinned it deftly, disemboweled and
cleaned. “The arrow pierced the heart through! I admire you, sir
wonderer! To hit a hare running across our way at forty steps, at
full tilt!”</p>

<p>“We rode slowly,” Oleg reminded,
frowning.</p>

<p>He struck fire, blew the spark up on the dry
moss. Reddish flames started licking honey-yellow twigs timidly,
then grew braver, gnawed deeper into twigs that crunched like sweet
bones in a dog’s strong teeth, sparks flying up. While Thomas
fussed around the fire, choosing a place to fry the slices of meat,
Oleg took a small camp bowl out of the bag silently and filled it
with water. “Holy father!” Thomas exclaimed in amazement. “You’ve
thought about everything!” He sliced the liver, stuck it on some
thin barked twigs, fried it over the coals diligently, while the
meat was boiled in the bowl. The wonderer had added some herbs to
the stew, their aromas drifted over the tiny glade.</p>

<p>After the meal, they lay in a light shadow,
watching the scorching sky through sparse branches. It was heated,
with not a cloud.</p>

<p>The horses chewed grass nearby, nibbled the
young sprouts of shrubs. Thomas put his hands behind his head, some
pieces of his armor off, but his sword and shield close at hand.
“What a wonderful world God created,” he said in quiet surprise.
“Once I told Saracens that in winter in our country water turns as
hard as stone. They made a mockery of me. If I said that our rains
last for weeks, that we curse rains and showers, they would not
believe either. For them, each drop of water is worth its weight in
gold, while we don’t know how to get rid of that water! My Britain
is all wild swampy woods.”</p>

<p>“Rus’ is the same,” Oleg agreed.</p>

<p>“It’s in Europe too? The forests here are
puny bushes as against ours. In our country, one can live a life
without seeing the sky! And here everything is seen through, no
place to stay alone. In our land, getting to a neighbor town is a
dangerous journey across bogs, wild woods, mess of wind-fallen
trees and bogs again and swamps and marshes!”</p>

<p>Oleg sounded sad. “If one of our princes
wants to war another, he has first of all to send scout parties
ahead to know the way. After the winter, there are always new
lakes, bogs, flooded areas. Then he has half of his army pave roads
and clean the way. And if an appanage prince refuses to pay tax,
what’s the way to force him? More trouble than it is worth! It’s
easier to attack Tsargrad<sup>7</sup> than a neighbor entrenched in his
bogs!”</p>

<p>“Is Rus’ all like that?” Thomas doubted.
“What about centaurs?”</p>

<p>“They belong to Southern Rus’. Some call it
Scythia<sup>8</sup>, in the old way . Everyone is a
rider there. It’s a space. No sky<emphasis>line</emphasis> there but a
sky<emphasis>round</emphasis>. Trees are rare but the grass is waist-high. They
are the same nation but differ from us in clothing and hunting ways
and prayers. The Forest and the Steppes have different gods.”</p>

<p>“God said: no Gentile or Jew! If to think it
over, we’re all the same nation, though we speak different tongues.
The God’s decree is to become a single nation again!”</p>

<p>Oleg gave him a surprised look. His soft
voice had a mock hidden deep in it: “A single nation bowing to your
only god? What about those who wouldn’t like it?”</p>

<p>Thomas punched the hot ground with his huge
fist. “We’ll force them. It is what God inspired the Great Crusade
for – turning Pagans into the true faith!”</p>

<p>Oleg tossed as if he were lying on sharp
stones. “The world is changing,” he said in a low voice. “Indeed it
is. Once men had been simply plundering. They did put it that
blunt: we’re going to plunder Tsargrad, they said. To get our
winter coats in Persia. Going to war to take slaves from our
neighbor, take loot and burn what we can’t take… Now we make wars
to bring civilization to faraway lands. Yes, we’re plundering still
but silent about it, ashamed of it… The millstones of culture mill
slowly but surely.”</p>

<p>Thomas sat up, feeling his beliefs insulted.
“What do you mean, sir wonderer?” he asked with dignity.</p>

<p>Oleg sat up too, looked at the sun. “We must
go. By evening we’ll be in the village I mentioned – and part
there. Your way is to Britain, mine – to Rus’. Or rather you can
have some more rest and I shall ride on.” He got up, dusted off,
made a deafening whistle. His horse tossed his head up, broke
through the bushes to him timidly. Oleg jumped into the saddle with
no touch to stirrups. The horse squatted under his weight.</p>

<p>“Your bowl!” Thomas cried.</p>

<p>Oleg waved aside. “Take it. A useful thing in
journey.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I’m used to being content with little.” He
began to turn his horse.</p>

<p>“Wait, sir wonderer!” Thomas cried. “I accept
your kind offer to ride to the village together. Every road seems
shorter when you have a companion.”</p>

<p>The wonderer’s face expressed no joy.
Probably he would rather stay alone with his thoughts of the High,
but Thomas hurried to pour the rest of the stew on the burning
coals, shoved the bowl into the bag, struggled into his armor
hastily, leaving two important clasps on his back undone.</p>

<p>He climbed into the saddle with an effort: a
hundred and ninety pounds in him not to count the armor, but the
destrier strolled on as he was used to, his huge steel horseshoes
thumping on the ground.</p>

<p>They outrode some carts loaded with poor
household chattels. Women and children sat there under awnings,
while men drove the draft horses, so dry and slim-legged as if the
violent heat had melted not only grease but also meat out of them.
The men followed big Franks with unfriendly eyes but looked down
when Thomas gave them a menacing once-over.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said suddenly. “We are
both riding north from Jerusalem. We could travel together for much
more than a day!”</p>

<p>The wonderer shook his head. “I’m not much a
one for fighting.”</p>

<p>“At least we could ride side by side for a
longer time! And if it comes to swords, I’ll cope myself.” He bit
his tongue when he remembered that the wonderer had witnessed his
last “coping”. He was the one who nursed Thomas back to health,
curing him with herbs and dressing his wounds.</p>

<p>“No,” the wonderer said firmly. Thomas
realized that nothing was to change his mind. “I am another sort of
man. Your road is different, as your life is. Besides, you are
secretive. I feel a strange thing about you. A very strange thing.
And a danger I can’t fathom.”</p>

<p>“Danger?” Thomas repeated in perplexity.
“Which one? Life is full of dangers. Especially a knight’s
life.”</p>

<p>For a moment, the wonderer rode silent. The
knight fidgeted impatiently, waiting for his answer. “Other
danger,” Oleg said reluctantly. “Somehow related to the cup. But
how? I don’t get it.”</p>

<p>“Your charms told you that?” Thomas whispered
in a superstitious fear.</p>

<p>“So they did.”</p>

<p>Thomas crossed himself, spat over his left
shoulder and cast a cautious glance around. They were riding
through a deserted place. “Our Lady, preserve and protect!.. If you
think bad of me, sir wonderer, it’s all my fault. You saved me
twice and I mistrusted you… Sir wonderer. The cup I bear is really
more than a cup!” He fell silent. Oleg rode by his side, still,
stalwart, and frowning as he looked at the way ahead. “Sir
wonderer, have you heard of… the Holy Grail?”</p>

<p>Thomas held his breath. He had said the last
words almost in a whisper, but they sounded thunder to him.</p>

<p>The wonderer shot a blade-sharp glance at
him. “Is it… that one?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>“It is,” Thomas replied in surprise. “You…
know it? You, Pagan?”</p>

<p>“When Christ, the god of yours, was
crucified,” Oleg said, “one of his followers placed a cup secretly
to collect his precious blood… Was it that way? Since that, you
hold that cup sacred. You call it the Holy Grail.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced around with caution. “You
see,” he whispered, “even you Pagans were reached by the fame of
Holy Grail. Many knights set out to find it: Sir Galahad, Sir
Lancelot, Sir Gawain, Sir Percival… But we needed Crusade to free
Jerusalem, the Holy City, from infidel Saracens, to free the Holy
Sepulcher and the holy places where Christ had walked…”</p>

<p>“How did you get the cup?” the wonderer
interrupted.</p>

<p>“In a fierce fight, sir wonderer. I wouldn’t
say it came rushing to my hands.”</p>

<p>“There’s a legend,” the wonderer spoke
harshly, his eyes fixed on Thomas, “that only a pure soul may take
the cup! Other men, it says, will get ill and die in throes…”</p>

<p>Thomas looked down. His cheeks blushed bright
crimson, the color spread over all his face and to his neck. Even
his ears flashed so brightly that one could light torches from
them. “Sir wonderer… I may die in throes, but first I’ll deliver
the cup to my blessed Britain! Let God’s grace fall on the heads of
Angles, the people who worship Christ… and for whom I’m ready to
give my life!”</p>

<p>Their horses walked side by side, so their
feet in the stirrups touched. The field workers followed them with
anxious eyes. Both riders looked enormous on the deserted road,
neither a tree nor a bush near it. Their horses are Frankish –
huge, heavy, stout-legged, their steel horseshoes crush the ground
with a crunch. The massive knight’s armor is glittering in the rays
of sunset as though covered with thick blood. Another rider is a
clod of darkness: hooded, still and gloomy in his black cloak, its
flaps flying like a black raven’s wings.</p>

<p>The sun set. The air started to lose its
heat, very slowly. Horses cheered up, feeling a rest soon. The
clear blue sky was darkening imperceptibly until it was menacing
lilac and the pale sickle of moon came out filled with ominous
light. <emphasis>A sun of vampires and dead things to replace the live
orange sun.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas breathed in the fresh, chilly air
happily. The violet sky changed to black. Stars hung straight
overhead: bright and big, the whole swarms of stars never seen in
the northern sky.</p>

<p>“It is close,” Oleg told him. “That group of
trees… It’s an orchard. There’s a house behind it. See it? Neither
see I.”</p>

<p>“How do you know then?” Thomas wondered.</p>

<p>“I know”, the wonderer said indifferently.
“As you know good places to build a castle, a smithy, a watchtower,
so I know such places for orchards and houses.”</p>

<p>The moon was flooding the world with ghostly
pallid light, only the areas beneath trees remained black as coals.
Horses walked on a trodden road but riders could barely hear the
sound of hooves. Somewhere behind the trees, frogs were crying in
strangely stern, metal voices. Thomas doubted whether it were
frogs. <emphasis>Here, in a desert?</emphasis> Oleg pointed silently at the
trees: metal trills were coming from branches.</p>

<p>The roof of a small house was seen from a
distance, surrounded closely by curly, well-groomed trees. The flat
earthen roof was moonlit, while the rest of the house dark. Thomas
and Oleg heard some risen male voices, drunken shouts, then a loud,
insistent knock on the door.</p>

<p>They reined their horses into a slow pace.
Trees hid them, allowing to approach on the dart throwing distance.
They stopped on the edge of a broad moonlit lawn near the house.
Before the porch, several motley-clothed men were laughing, passing
among them a wicker basket with a narrow jug mouth sticking out
from it. One of them hammered at the door with his fist and roared,
“Open the door! Open it, you stupid woman! Or we break in!”</p>

<p>A faint female voice replied from inside:
“What do you want? Go away!” She sounded scared, almost
weeping,</p>

<p>“You’ll know what we want!” the man cried
hoarsely. “Let us in!”</p>

<p>“I have a knife to protect myself!”</p>

<p>Thomas breathed faster, his face contorted
scarily, dark in the faint moonlight. Oleg hemmed with sympathy,
his eyes thoughtful. The knight was shaking with fury, his eyes
popped out, his lips white and trembling. He seized his helmet and
slapped it on. The visor shielded his face with a clink.</p>

<p>The man at the door roared with laughter. His
friends cried cheerfully. One of them ran onto the porch, shouted
in drunken boldness, “You can’t stab all of us! But you can… ha
ha!.. sate all of us if you try your best!”</p>

<p>“I brought true men to amuse you!” the first
man cried in a hollow voice. “Open it, silly!”</p>

<p>They heard a woman weeping inside. “She can’t
kill all of you but we can!” Thomas cried, his voice constrained
with fury.</p>

<p>The laughter stopped. In full silence, men
turned to the trees. Their hands gripped daggers, axes and swords.
The horses beneath Oleg and Thomas stood motionless, as well as the
villains. Apparently, they had been the masters of night up to that
day, no one dared to challenge them. “Hey,” one of them cried from
the porch, “whoever you are! Stay where you stand, and you’ll be
safe. Or go to hell if you don’t want your bones dragged away by
dogs!”</p>

<p>Thomas roared with a creepy laugher, like a
mighty lion to a jackal sprawled in his paws. “My bones?
<emphasis>Your</emphasis> bones are straw for my sword!”</p>

<p>Two villains stirred at last, started to move
closer to the darkness beneath trees. Oleg drew the bow string
briskly and seized an arrow.</p>

<p>The villains came closer, their eyes made out
the dim shapes of riders when Oleg put the arrow on. The bow string
clicked, his fingertips gripped another arrow at once, he made a
shot, seized the next arrow… The quiver was over his shoulder, so
the wonderer could pull arrow out, put it on the bow and shot it
with a single move, and he did it with such a lightning speed that
Thomas had barely drove his horse into a heavy gallop when several
arrows swished by him in a sequence. Someone near the house shouted
in fury.</p>

<p>Thomas burst out of the shadow with roar,
bent down to the horse’s neck, his lance pointed ahead. The two
closest villains froze on the spot, advancing their daggers. Thomas
pierced one through like a leaf, his bones crunched under the
lance, another was trampled by his destrier. The night filled with
terrible cries. Men were running away from the house, falling. In
the ghostly moonlight Thomas saw glittering silver feathers in
their necks, backs and breasts. The arrows went easily into the
flesh of half-naked villains.</p>

<p>Thomas’s lance had been left behind, so he
pulled out a sword, slashed the third villain slantwise, brandished
at the next one but saw a white bloom opened at his chest, with a
wooden stem. The villain fell to his knees, blood gushed out from
his mouth. Thomas yelled, shook his sword at Oleg. The rest three
were fleeing along the road, their coal-black shadows darting ahead
of them like night birds. Thomas bellowed and drove his warhorse
after them.</p>

<p>Oleg rode out of shadows slowly, an arrow on
his bow string. He watched and listened, but there were only death
rattles and moans in the night. Soon he heard the thud of hooves
that amplified to thunder. A big ferocious knight burst out onto
the lawn in all his magnificence, a huge sword slantwise in hand,
big drops falling on the ground from the blade. He seemed to be
just out of butchery, even his horse splashed with blood.</p>

<p>“You killed all!” Thomas barked at Oleg.
“Could you have been a slower shooter?”</p>

<p>“As a child, I was taught to have seven
arrows in the air.”</p>

<p>“We are not in your Pagan Rus’! Here, in the
Christian world, men can barely shoot at all.” He pulled up, made a
circle around the lawn. The wounded men tried to crawl away,
moaning, leaving dark traces of blood behind. Soon they got silent
and motionless, with their fingers dug into the ground.</p>

<p>The door was opened with caution. A pale
female face appeared in the slit, then her thin hand. Making sure
of no villains on the porch, the woman came out silently: small,
thin in waist, her eyes big and scared.</p>

<p>Thomas waved his metal hand at her. The
sword, dark with blood, was still in it. The knight checked
himself, wiped the blade hastily and sheathed it. Oleg took the bow
string off, hid the bow in its case. The woman ran down briskly,
her heels tapped on the porch as a squirrel’s paws. She bent over a
wounded villain, turned him to his back.</p>

<p>Thomas touched the reins, his stallion moved
closer to the woman, like a dark mountain, the ground trembling and
thumping under his hooves. The woman jerked up her head, her face
pale, her eyes wide with fear. “Thank you for your interference,
noble knight,” she said quickly.</p>

<p>“It’s my duty,” Thomas replied gallantly.</p>

<p>“Now… please help me carry this man into the
house.”</p>

<p>“What for?” Thomas wondered.</p>

<p>“To put him to bed, to dress his wound!”</p>

<p>Thomas’s gauntlet slapped on the saddle.
“Woman! You feel pity for a beast who wanted to take you by force
and kill you! Let him die. As a Christian, I’m never angry with the
dead.”</p>

<p>“Then you should have killed him at once!”
she objected passionately. “Now the fight is over, it’s time to
lick wounds. I won’t have a man die at my door! Even if he’s no man
but an evil wolf!”</p>

<p>Oleg dismounted. “Open the door. I’ll
help.”</p>

<p>He seized the wounded man by his collar and
belt. The woman ran up the porch. Thomas dismounted, his good
spirits lost. <emphasis>This silly woman knows nothing.</emphasis> The beginning
was fine: a cry for help, a brief fight, a woman saved – but then
all of it turned folly. <emphasis>Province!</emphasis> And the wonderer could be
expected of even less so. <emphasis>A Pagan, uneducated, just out of caves
where any good manners can hardly be learnt.</emphasis></p>

<p>While the men was put to bed and Oleg dressed
his wounds and the woman – Chachar was her name – warmed some
water, Thomas examined the bodies outside. Five dead, two wounded
badly: unconscious, hardly able to breath. Thomas was glad the
merciful woman had not noticed them. He took out his misericord, a
long narrow dagger made to finish wounded knights off through a
visor slit, and stabbed their throats.</p>

<p>Five villains were killed with arrows: shot
in head, in throat, two shot in heart, and Oleg’s arrow in back had
also reached the heart. One man was span with lance like a bug with
a spin. The one trampled by the destrier had been carried to the
house. On the road, Thomas had run down and slashed three more.
Overall, he had sent to the Hell five – as many as the
wonderer.</p>

<p>Cheered up a bit, he tethered the horses and
started to pull the arrows out. The force with which the wonderer
had sent them was amazing. Some men were pierced through. By the
moment he plucked all five arrows, he got all covered with blood
again, like a butcher. <emphasis>Bow is a dreadful weapon.</emphasis> The Holy
Church had a purpose to oppose it and to prohibit crossbows, or
arbalests, at all. <emphasis>With a bow, even a coward can slay a hero. If
heroes die and ambushed cowards remain safe, it will put an end to
courage. Battles should be honest: breast to breast, face to
face!</emphasis></p>

<p>He wiped the arrows clean, washed himself in
the barrel of water near the porch and went into the house.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter
6</p>

<p>The small woman’s house was neat and tidy,
with fire blazing in a big stove and stew gurgling appetizingly in
pots. Chachar served bowls to the table. Her cheeks reddened and
eyes glistened while she stared at Thomas and Oleg in joy. She was
young and tempting, her ripe breasts almost bounced out of her
low-necked dress – so light in that southern heat that it did not
hide her sinful, as the Christian faith put it, body but draw
seductively its every detail.</p>

<p>Oleg, a Pagan, feasted his eyes upon the
young woman gladly, but Thomas began to feel uneasy. Twice he
choked with tiny pieces of meat. Chachar kept serving him more and
more of it, pouring with sauces, sprinkling with herbs, spices, red
and black pepper – and looking in his eyes, moving her whole body
closer to him, all but whining and waving her tail like a pup. Her
lips, plump as ripe cherries, came apart, showing pearl-white
teeth, as pointed as a child’s. Her whole being caught every desire
of the brave knight.</p>

<p>Oleg ate unhurriedly. He did not listen to
the conversation but replayed the fight in his mind’s eyes and
approved own behavior gloomily. He had felt no desire to kill, no
warrior’s delight – he was just annoyed and blankly sad. That meant
he could keep his bow and arrows: they would not make him go
astray. Neither would they obscure his search for Truth.</p>

<p>The house had two rooms, the wounded man
lying in the back one. He dared not to moan, in fear of being
killed if they heard. Chachar brought him some food and came back
anxious. “He has a fever… What can we do?”</p>

<p>Thomas waved aside with irritation but Oleg
was the first to reply. “I’ll have a sleep there and see to him.”
He stood up.</p>

<p>“Would you stay at the table for a bit more
time?” Chachar said briskly. “Men love to feast! I can bring some
old wine, a couple of jugs I still have in my cellar.”</p>

<p>“We’ve had a shattering day,” Oleg replied.
On the threshold of another room, he turned back and nodded at
Thomas. “But sir knight might amuse you with his stories. He’d been
fighting the Holy Land free, storming Jerusalem…”</p>

<p>He shut the door behind him, fell on the bed
that was knocked of planks roughly. The wounded man held his breath
in another corner. Oleg put his hands behind his head and fell fast
asleep.</p>

<p>But he had touched his charms before, so his
dreams were full of blood and fear.</p>

<p>Early in the morning, he woke up to merry
voices outside. Thomas, naked to his waist, washed his face near
the water barrel. Chachar poured water on his hands, laughing,
trying to splash it on his back – white as a woman’s but muscular
as a proper man’s, with two bluish scars under the shoulder blade.
The knight squealed, jumped aside: the water was icy cold, taken
from a spring.</p>

<p>Oleg stepped aside from the window on his
toes. The knight’s armor lay on a wide bench, clean and polished to
a shine, which could have hardly been done with Thomas’s own hands.
The huge sword hung on two iron hooks in the wall. The steel-plated
gauntlets were on the windowsill, beside flower pots… <emphasis>Just
yesterday night, this woman was in terrible danger, and the knight
was crucified, burnt, and tortured just a day before. Great is the
vitality</emphasis> <emphasis>Gods endowed Man with. They must have prepared a
hard lot for him.</emphasis></p>

<p>The door slammed. Thomas entered the room,
disheveled and smiling. His tanned face looked as if it had been
stolen from another body – the tan ended abruptly at his throat.
“How did you sleep, sir wonderer?”</p>

<p>“Well, thanks,” Oleg replied, staring at the
knight. “And you have circles under eyes. You can stay here and
have a rest.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“I’m leaving after breakfast,” Oleg said with
no further explanations.</p>

<p>Thomas looked embarrassed. He put his clothes
on hastily, began to pace up and down the room. “Sir wonderer… We
are both heading for the north. May we ride together to
Constantinople at least? You have no way to escape it, neither have
I. All roads from Asia lead to this second Rome – the only place
where Europe meets Asia!”</p>

<p>“Why do you want it?”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer, I’ll be frank with you. It is
the woman.”</p>

<p>Oleg looked at the young knight intently.
“What are you going to do? Sell her? We drove the rapists away but
we can’t stay here to guard her innocence.”</p>

<p>Thomas sounded unhappy. “She has… entrusted
herself to us. Her husband – or maybe her patron, I did not
understand and felt no need to elicit – was killed last week. They
took the horses, so she got stuck in the house. She begs to take
her away from this scary place.”</p>

<p>Oleg came to the window, looked over the yard
and Chachar at the green valley, the olive grove and curly bushes,
at the blue merciless sky with not a hint of rain. He shrugged.
“She did not beg <emphasis>me</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked miserable as he was at that
moment. “Sir wonderer… I have my hands full with the cup. Maybe you
could?..”</p>

<p>Oleg brought his quiver from another room,
checked the arrows quickly and put it on his back. With a desperate
look on his face, Thomas watched the strange pilgrim adjust his
belt in a very professional way, drag the two-handed sword from
under the bench. “Do what you like,” Oleg replied. “And I have no
interest in women.”</p>

<p>“She’s not a woman! She’s a victim. We are
bound to help her. Don’t <emphasis>your</emphasis> gods tell you to help the
weak?”</p>

<p>Oleg cast a piercing look at him. “But Pagans
are bad, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Not <emphasis>that</emphasis> bad!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas. I am looking for salvation for
all people in the world.”</p>

<p>“So you let each single one die?”</p>

<p>Oleg paused, then asked abruptly, “What your
woman wants?”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>My</emphasis> woman? Sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>“Well, not yours then, though she thinks
otherwise. What does she want?”</p>

<p>“She asked to take her to any big city.”</p>

<p>Oleg thought for a while. His shoulders,
heavy as big stones, moved reluctantly. “Two days’ journey… We’ll
be there by tomorrow evening. I can stand it. Then I’ll give you
the horse – you need a spare one in all your steel. A
<emphasis>remount</emphasis>, I mean.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“On foot, as I’m used to.”</p>

<p>Thomas did not fathom why go on foot when you
can ride, but he didn’t want to irritate his comrade and said
nothing.</p>

<p>After they broke a hearty fast (Chachar put
on the table all of her stock), Oleg went to the horses. There were
six of them left by marauders. He saddled three as remounts and
prepared the most beautiful one for Chachar, a highborn lady. <emphasis>At
least Thomas very much wants her to be that.</emphasis></p>

<p>When Thomas put his armor on (Chachar must
have helped him) and stepped heavily out on the porch, three
saddled horses were pawing the ground impatiently under the window.
Three remounts were loaded with bags, packs, and bundles. The
wonderer was searching the dead men, turning out their pockets,
collecting coins and rings. He had fastened the captured sabers and
darts to the remounts. Each spare horse also carried a water
skin.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said with surprise,
“are we crossing a desert?”</p>

<p>“There are no wells on the short cut. Without
water, we’ll have to make a hook and over.”</p>

<p>“A hook? And over?”</p>

<p>“This is Rossian for a longer road. I mean
that with own water supply we can take a shorter way.”</p>

<p>Thomas’s face expressed hesitation, as if he
could not decide whether a shorter way was better. <emphasis>They say: he
who cuts his way never comes home by night, and he who rides
straight gets to devil.</emphasis> He turned his head and called Chachar.
Her clear voice replied from inside, a clatter of dishes joined it.
Thomas gave Oleg a guilty smile and went into the house.</p>

<p>Chachar came out in men’s clothing and a
traveling cloak. She lingered on the porch, staring at the wonderer
as if she had never seen him before. Thomas also stopped, gazing at
the one who was his comrade in the stone quarry.</p>

<p>The wonderer had left his cloak in the house
and came out in a short sleeveless wolfskin jacket, fur outside.
The jack was open, allowing to see his breast, as wide as a granite
slab, and his bare shoulders, massive and glistening like rocks.
His longs arms seemed to be carved of a dark oak, so thick and
strong they were, bulging with sinews and muscle. His body was
mighty but his face still and humble. His fire-red hair was tied
with a silk lace over the eyebrows. Thomas found this look
strangely attractive,</p>

<p>The wonderer’s trousers were made of curried
leather. His belt was thick, with iron pendants scattering sunbeams
all along it. A flack and a narrow knife were suspended on rings on
the left of his belt. Two rings on the right – for a short sword –
remained empty.</p>

<p>“A sword, an axe, a cleaver,” Thomas offered.
“Would you take any?” He descended from the porch, still staring at
the transformed wonderer. Back in the stone quarry Oleg had not
pined: on the contrary, he had fleshed out with dry muscle. Now his
big body had not a drop of fat, as if it were forged of steel.</p>

<p>“I’ve left the axe on a remount,” Oleg
replied indifferently. “I don’t like to carry much steel on.”</p>

<p>Thomas stroked his armor involuntarily. He
thought that such a bull as the wonderer was born to carry whole
mountain ridges. “Wolf skins were worn by barbarians who sacked
Rome,” he said ironically.</p>

<p>“And destroyed it.”</p>

<p>“So they did,” Thomas agreed reluctantly.
“But you are vulnerable like that!”</p>

<p>The wonderer turned the hem of his jacket
back. On the inner side, two knife handles glittered side by side,
identical as peas in a pod.</p>

<p>“Knives?” Thomas said in surprise. “What
for?”</p>

<p>The wonderer stooped. Thomas pulled a knife
carefully. It went out of the leather case in a reluctant, balking
way, as if it didn’t want to leave its nest where its twin remained
warm.</p>

<p>While Chachar walked around horses, shifting
the saddle bags in her way, Thomas turned the knife in hand,
watched the blade in enchantment. He remembered the throw with
which the wonderer had cleaned their way out of the shape-shifter
Baron’s castle.</p>

<p>The blade was razor-sharp, no longer than a
palm, but heavy, thickened on end. One side has the cutting edge,
while another, for some strange reason, a stripe of base copper
riveted to the excellent steel. The gleaming blade is seated on the
straight shabby bone of a handle covered with small notches. <emphasis>To
prevent fingers from slipping</emphasis>, Thomas guessed. Once he saw the
throwing knives of Assassins, members of a secret Saracen sect, but
those had wooden hilts. In the best knives, the wood was stretched
over with shark skin, so rough that even sweaty fingers would never
slip off. He scratched the sparkling spot of damask steel on the
top of the hilt: the blade was set through it, the upper end bent
down to keep the bone in place firmly.</p>

<p>“Why this strip of copper?” he asked with
displeasure. “It ruins the beauty!”</p>

<p>“Beauty?” Oleg smirked. “What’s beautiful
about murder?”</p>

<p>“A murder holds no beauty,” Thomas replied
with dignity, “but a joust does.”</p>

<p>“Yes. The more complicated and magnificent
rite, the less the murder itself is visible… This strip protects
against stabs.”</p>

<p>Thomas was surprised. “Fencing with such a
short thing?”</p>

<p>“You’re still to be convinced that the world
has other lands than Britain?”</p>

<p>Chachar mounted at last, tired of waiting for
the knight to help her, when Thomas checked himself. She sent him a
charming smile from the saddle. He smiled back guiltily, handed the
knife back to the wonderer and mounted his huge stallion.</p>

<p>Oleg outrode the knight and the young woman
to let them chat without him in the way. The day was bright and
sunny, the bloody night left behind, as well as the house with the
wounded man in its back room. <emphasis>Intact save broken bones, so he’ll
go robbing and plundering again as soon as his broken leg
knits.</emphasis></p>

<p>The woman’s happy laughter and the knight’s
manly voice were behind Oleg. He went deep into brooding. As his
hand touched the charms habitually, a vague fear began to creep
into his soul, breaking through clean and sublime thoughts about
the secret purport of life and being. One charm stuck in his
fingers too frequently – the one showing swords, arrows, fierce
griffons and heavenly fire… The world is dangerous: villains rob on
the roads, marauders break into villages, wolf packs wait for a
lone traveler, but charms are silent about such daily mess, trifles
and small inconveniences. That was the ordinary life – but now
dangers seemed to be beckoned from every side, dragged onto their
way!</p>

<p>Oleg looked himself over, then shot a glance
back. The knight was telling Chachar of heroic deeds and battles,
throwing out his chest proudly, roaring with laughter. <emphasis>Is he
dangerous? An ordinary knight, one of many in this land captured by
Arabs and then invaded by European hosts? Or is it the
woman?</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg missed the moment when the woman’s
laughter ceased. Suddenly, he heard Thomas nearby. “Sir wonderer,
what’s the good of that copper?”</p>

<p>Oleg started, gave the knight a puzzled look.
Thomas rode stirrup by stirrup with him, keen curiosity written on
his face. Woman rode behind in resentful silence.</p>

<p>“I’m interested in weapons,” Thomas
explained. “Surely, knives are no knightly weapon, but as a unit
commander in the assault of Jerusalem, I learnt to use different…
Not for myself, for I am a noble knight of Gisland, but for my men
I had to… Do you understand, sir wonderer?”</p>

<p>“When you slash with swords,” Oleg said,
annoyed with being brought back to mundane matters, “they collide
and slide. The fight gets clumsy, ill-predictable… When I parry a
blow with my knife, I know exactly where the enemy’s blade is.
Copper is soft. A blade will not slip along it but be stopped.”</p>

<p>He took the knife out, handed it to the
knight. Thomas turned it in hand, his gaze shifted to the
wonderer’s big hands. “Isn’t the handle short for you?”</p>

<p>“Three fingers fit into? That’s enough. And
there’s room for a thumb on another side. That will do for a good
throw. The shorter handle is the better. Would you like a try? On
the average, the thrown knife makes a turn in the air within seven
steps, so it will stab the one standing or running in three, ten or
thirteen steps.”</p>

<p>“What if the enemy’s in eight steps?”</p>

<p>“Then you make it turn faster. Or slower.
That’s all.”</p>

<p>Thomas handed the knife back hastily. “No! A
knight is not a kind of wandering Gypsy.”</p>

<p>“Hum… What about wandering knights?”</p>

<p>“Errant!” Thomas corrected indignantly.
“<emphasis>Errant</emphasis> knights! Back in the times of King Arthur and since
then, the knights of the Round Table were erring in search of
adventure…”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what Gypsies do?.. Well, well. By
the way, you can throw a knife in a knightly way – straight, as if
it were a dart. With no turns! That is what the blade ends are made
heavier for, and the handle is made of light wood or bone. Would
you try?”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head. “We, Angles of
Britain, have an inquiring mind but little love for changes. A good
sword and a long spear are our weapons for ever and ever! We shall
always remain what God has made us!”</p>

<p>He reined up. Oleg rode farther, alone with
his thoughts. Soon he heard the silver tinkle of woman’s laughter
behind, then a hollow burst of the knight’s laughter. Oleg marveled
at the powers of their vitality and endurance again. <emphasis>Gods must
have prepared a hard way ahead for man. Otherwise they’d not give
him such powers.</emphasis></p>

<p>The road rose on a mountain peak and Oleg had
time, before a descend, to take the environs in at a glance: green
hills, a valley with smooth square fields, small villages – and a
high ramparted castle far ahead. At the distance it seemed small
like a toy, no details visible, but the road went there, swarmed
with galloping riders and slow heavy-loaded carts.</p>

<p>Frowning, he drove his horse down slowly. The
road was trodden, gently sloping, sided with old olives with
swollen trunks and crooked branches that seemed to be bent in
torment. The heat grew torrid. The bright blue sky was getting
lighter until it was the off-white color of ashes. The air turned
so dry that a breath of it was scratching. They saw hares darting
and heard quails chirring in the wheat fields and thick grass along
roadsides.</p>

<p>Thomas rode in his armor stoically, only his
helmet off and hanging on the saddle hook. The wind ruffled his
flaxen hair, tore drops of sweat off his red steamed face. Chachar
tried to sing, laughed, kept stealing glances in the knight’s eyes
of bright blue color, strange and wonderful in this land of
brown-eyed people.</p>

<p>At noon Oleg spotted some rich greenery from
a distance, turned there and found a small stream. They made a
halt, watered horses. Chachar spread food and spices on the
tablecloth. Oleg undressed, rinsed himself with the icy water that
made its way upward to the sun from goodness-knows-which depth.
Thomas watched him with envy. Finally, the knight could not help
stripping naked himself and dipping into the stream, which was less
than knee-deep. He screamed and laughed happily, raising clouds of
sparkling spray. He also washed his clothes, beat them with stones
and spread out in the grass to dry up.</p>

<p>When Oleg untied the bags of oat from horse
snouts, Thomas was sitting near the stream, tearing his white skin
with nails as hard as hooves, his face twisted with exceptional
enjoyment. “Flies…” he moaned through gritted teeth. “Begot by
Satan himself for torturing Christian knights. They get under
pieces of armor where no Saracen saber can reach…”</p>

<p>“Flies? Really?”</p>

<p>“Disgusting white worms! They make flies, be
it known to you, sir wonderer.”</p>

<p>“I know it,” Oleg muttered, “but a noble
knight knowing that <emphasis>is</emphasis> a surprise!”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head, scratching himself
furiously. “You won’t believe what silly things are put in our
heads as children! To be named a knight, one has to learn trivium
and quadrivium, to sing and make verses, to read and write… But I,
to tell the truth, went into knightly exercise most of all!”</p>

<p>“I can guess,” Oleg mumbled. “If even kings
in Europe can’t read and sign with <emphasis>a cross</emphasis>…”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t matter,” Thomas dismissed with
light heart. “As soon as a king receives a letter, he has a Jew
caught and brought to him. All Jews can read and write, as required
by their faith. The Jew reads the letter to the king. He dictates
the answer, the Jew scribbles it, the letter is sealed and sent
back with a rider! That’s all. And the king who gets the answer
will also have a Jew brought to read it.”</p>

<p>“Very convenient,” Oleg agreed.</p>

<p>Thomas did not catch the sarcasm. He reached
an itching place between his shoulder blades and groaned with
joy.</p>

<p>“Call Chachar,” Oleg offered. “She has cat’s
nails.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back warily at the woman. She
was sitting half-turned in few steps, listening. Her cheek and pink
ear were blush red, hands moved awkwardly, dropping meat, eggs and
onions. “I can’t,” Thomas replied finally. “She’s a woman of noble
birth! I can’t make her do this plain work.”</p>

<p>“Of course a common woman would have
scratched your back better. But she’s unlikely to be found
here.”</p>

<p>After the lunch and a brief rest, they
continued the journey. Soon they rode in a hundred steps past a
strange ancient building. It stood in a flat valley, high thick
grass swaying around it, the entrance overgrown with shrubs, thick
green ropes climbing up the walls, clinging to the cracks, their
leaves glistening like wax. The building was enormous, gloomy,
formed by huge grey stone blocks. Having been abandoned for
centuries, dented by winds and heat, it was a silent memory of
ancient empires and vanished nations.</p>

<p>Oleg felt anguish gnaw at his heart. <emphasis>It is
known that Black God would not allow Man to climb out from wildness
and ignorance to the shining peaks where the Fair Gods dwell! He
plots and impedes, but people are helped by Fair Cods who created
them.</emphasis> However, there is still more loss than success on the
thorny path. A seat of culture is barely created when the wild
hordes sent by Black God would ruin its prospering cities, burn
libraries, destroy dams and canals… It is raised from the ruins –
and ruined, burned and butchered again by beastly men. Endlessly,
all the time… Too much loss, blood and suffering.</p>

<p>Surely, the Man is moving to the shining
peak. Though rolling down almost to the bottom after each disaster,
he then climbs a bit higher than he did the last time. The young
European kingdoms, despite all their ignorance and violence of
savages, are more humane in heart as compared to ancient empires
who left the ruins of colossal circuses where live men – gladiators
– had fought to death. <emphasis>Those empires built pyramids, lighthouses
and temples where thousands of people were sacrificed, while the
new Barbarian faith only had one human sacrifice, the last and the
greatest one: Christ, the founder of the faith, gave his life.
Since that, people are not sacrificed any more. Even gladiator
battles were replaced by chariot racing…</emphasis></p>

<p>The evening was falling. They headed for the
crimson half of the sky: it looked as though covered with dry
blood, dark and brown, bright purple drops let out in the ruptures
only. The sun was half below the skyline, long reddish shadows lay
across the evening land.</p>

<p>The road led to the castle: it stood out
gloomily against the crimson sun and expanded with every step they
made. Oleg looked at it with a sullen eye, urged his horse on, so
that to pass it before dark. The lands around the castle looked
swept by a terrible storm. Everything was broken, trampled, and
soiled. Wide stubs glistened in place of the grove, for the trees
had been sawn down almost at the ground level. The castle stands in
the middle of trampled field – freshly built, its watchtowers still
not roofed. No annexes: only a great square keep of four floors and
stables and a rampart surrounding a large area of the roughly
loosened ground. The main building has holes instead of windows,
some with fresh-forged grates in them. A flag with eagles, dragons
and roaring bears is flying over the castle gate.</p>

<p>Thomas was telling Chachar loudly and
competently that shrubs and trees had been cut down and grass burnt
in order not to allow a wicked enemy to get close without being
seen. “The land is still Saracen, Christian warriors need to
consolidate the captured lands urgently. After that, they will be
able to extend their noble rule to other Pagan nations.”</p>

<p>They had already passed the castle when the
gate opened and two riders burst out at full tilt. Both cried
loudly, waved their hands. Thomas reined up and turned his horse
slowly, his lance pointed menacingly at the approaching strangers.
Oleg rode aside, took his bow and draw the string briskly. Chachar
hid behind the shining knight’s back.</p>

<p>Two unarmed, save daggers on their belts,
young boys in very bright clothes came to them unhurriedly, reined
up in three steps. One of the boys raised his palm. “I am a squire
of Sir Gorvel, the noble knight!” he said in a clear ringing voice.
“My lord asks you, tired travelers, to do him a honor of your
visit! You are invited to have a rest in his castle. Your horses
will be fed by choice corn, and you will be woken up in the
morning… if only you don’t prefer to stay for a few more days.”</p>

<p>Oleg took a breath in, going to refuse
firmly, when Thomas cried happily: “Gorvel? We climbed the walls of
Jerusalem together with him, like two evil monkeys! Arrows swished,
stones flew, and two of us stood back to back… Is it his castle?
He’s a seignior now?”</p>

<p>“The King granted him these lands,” the
squire replied with such pride as if it were himself granted with
them. “There are only seven of us. The rest are Saracen, hirelings
and vagrant folk, but the location is perfect – the crossing of
caravan roads!”</p>

<p>Thomas waved imperiously for Oleg to come to,
drove his horse along the road to the castle. Chachar cast a
triumphant look at the wonderer who looked like a wild animal to
her. She caught up with the magnificent knight and young squires
briskly. Oleg hid the arrow, followed them reluctantly.</p>

<p>The squires shouted to the guards at the
gate. One of them blew a horn, though the guards had seen them from
the wall before. The squires made way respectfully for guests,
including Oleg in his barbarian clothes. He could not help
shuddering. He never liked strangers behind himself, especially
when his soul shrunk with a vague foreboding of evil.</p>

<p>The gate swung open. In their way, blocking
the passage, a huge red-bearded knight stood in his armor, his
helmet in the crook of right arm, his shoulder-long hair, as red as
fire, ruffled slightly by the wind.</p>

<p>Thomas vaulted off the horse heavily with a
clang of steel. The red-bearded knight came to him. They embraced
with such a thunder as if two forgers collided, thrown by giant
hands. While they clapped each another on shoulders and shouted
happily, it sounded like an iron gate being knocked out by a ram,
with sparks scattering around.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas!”</p>

<p>“Sir Gorvel!”</p>

<p>The squires and a handful of guards were
standing around in a sparse circle, looking at the mighty warriors
in silent awe. Finally, one man dared to lift his sword and cry
glory to the Crusader army.</p>

<p>The squire took the reins of Oleg’s horse.
“I’ll take them to stables,” he said with an air of importance.
“You go to the servant room, have dinner there.”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, jumped off and squatted,
stretching his legs. He thrust the bow and quiver into his bag over
shoulder, left the axe by the saddle but took the sword. Chachar
flew down as a butterfly, threw the reins gracefully to another
squire.</p>

<p>Thomas released himself from the read-bearded
lord’s embrace. “Wait, sir wonderer!” he cried to Oleg hastily.
“Stop, you deaf devil! Sir Gorvel, this man is no servant to me but
a brave companion-at-arms. A co-fighter, as they say in Rus’.”</p>

<p>Gorvel put his hands in thin mail gloves on
Oleg’s shoulders in a friendly manner. “Welcome, Sir… wonderer. My
castle is your castle. Please feel at home! Angles say: my home is
my castle, but we are another sort of man – all wide open, our
hearts on our sleeves…”</p>

<p>His tanned scarred face expressed
astonishment: his gauntleted hands seemed to be lying on round
granite boulders.</p>

<p>“We don’t need much,” Oleg said sulkily. “A
pitch of hay for horses, a corner for us to sleep in, a slice of
bread for dinner.”</p>

<p>Gorvel clapped on his iron hips, upset. “What
is not, that is not! Poor horses will have to eat choice oats,
guests – to be content with feather beds in chambers. As to dinner,
we can only serve pies and sweet biscuits instead of bread. We’ll
also find something for you to wash those dry things down your
throats!”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at Gorvel closely and laughed.
“If you are the same, I beg you not to serve wine in barrels!
Several jugs will be enough.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Gorvel comforted him. “It’s
enough… to start with!”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter
7</p>

<p>Oleg entered the great hall and stopped for a
moment, stunned by loud voices, jokes, toasts, and songs. In the
bright light of blazing tar torches, at two broad tables, all the
seven Franks in the company of Saracens (those turned Christians or
simply in service of Gorvel, a brave warrior) had a feast: eating,
drinking, crying out toasts.</p>

<p>Oleg felt their tenacious, searching looks
with his skin. He knew he looked like a Frank, with his red hair,
green eyes, big bones and bulging muscle, but a Frank washed
suspiciously clean. His wet hair was plastered to the forehead, his
clothes dusted off. Frankish knights in the land of Saracen kept up
their European habits, washing their bodies fewer times a year than
their Saracen servants and mercenaries who lived up to Koran did in
a week. At their feast, dishes were given to dogs to lick them
clean. Hounds rushed about the hall, fighting for bones, raising
their back legs to water the legs of tables and, preferably, those
of guests, Chachar in particular, to mark these people as
familiars.</p>

<p>Fiery-bearded Gorvel and Sir Thomas were
seated in throne-like wooden armchairs, others on broad benches.
Four people were seated separately, facing the lord: Chachar, a
tall beautiful woman of breeding with tired eyes next to her, a
handsome young man with a sleek face and arrogant malevolent eyes,
and – as in every Christian castle – a stout monk in black cassock
belted with a plain rope.</p>

<p>Gorvel stood up, showed Oleg (with a wide
gesture that almost knocked down a servant with a tray) his place
next to the monk. The latter pretended to move aside but only
pulled up to himself a big jug and a plate with half a roast boar
instead.</p>

<p>The monk reeked of roast onions and sour
wine. Oleg sat, elbowed a space for himself, reached the roast boar
haunch, salted it. The salt here was strangely white and fine. A
servant put a wide cup in front of him, but Oleg did not move a
muscle. While eating meat, he felt strength filling him: beastly
but quiet and meek that time, ready to obey every order of spirit,
in fear of being plunged into starvation, hardships and torments
once again. He had never been much for drinking wine, and that was
no proper time at all. He sensed a vague danger within the hall and
needed his wits with him.</p>

<p>Gorvel and Thomas clapped on each other’s
shoulders loudly, drank for the battle in Cilicia, for the fight on
the walls of the Tower of David, for the victory in Terland. <emphasis>No
mention of Jerusalem: they must have celebrated big cities
before.</emphasis> Gorvel’s eyes glittered, his face reddened, he spoke
loudly and tried to roar marching songs. Their toasts referred to
small towns and keeps that, as Oleg realized, were to be followed
by settlements, villages, homesteads, wells, barns and hen coops.
Anyway, there was so much wine that it would suffice to drink for
each stone in the Temple of Solomon and for each nail in the twenty
gates of the Tower of David.</p>

<p>The young man winced arrogantly at Gorvel’s
laughter. In times he bowed to the tall beauty’s ear and whispered
something, and she nodded with her eyes down. Oleg caught her
single look at the handsome lad and understood much of it, but that
was none of his concerns. <emphasis>People play their games everywhere in
the same way, though everyone thinks of own self and situation as
unique.</emphasis> Oleg even felt relieved at the familiar sight of their
looks and gestures – those two were no danger. <emphasis>And the monk? He
cares of his belly and nothing more.</emphasis> Whether Gorvel kept him
half-starving or the monk’s own reason was lost to greed, but he
grabbed everything he could reach, hiccupped, choked, dropped
slices of meat and moved his knees apart hastily to catch them.
<emphasis>A woman’s habit.</emphasis> <emphasis>A man accustomed to wearing pants would
have moved his knees together.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg knocked aside the dogs who jumped over
his feet. <emphasis>In Rus’, dogs are not allowed even to decrepit houses.
Even the poorest mongrel has an isolated doghouse – and this castle
seems to be a great kennel itself!</emphasis></p>

<p>Gorvel and Thomas roared with laughter,
changing a mighty clap for a clap. They had left their armor in the
armory, so their friendly slapping sounded as if a thick tree were
lashed to drive a bear down from it or wild bees out of a hollow in
its trunk. Gorvel’s wife shot hostile glances at her husband. The
young man winced and raised his eyebrows ironically. Oleg spotted
that the eyes on his young face looked very old. Then he noticed a
thin netting of wrinkles, some burst blood vessels in the white of
the man’s eyes, the guarded looks he cast at laughing Thomas. The
merry knights recalled, in eager rivalry, what they felt while
standing back to back among hundreds of Saracens. The ladders had
broken, leaving them on the wall: two Christian knights against
infidels…</p>

<p>The wine splashed on the table from Gorvel’s
cup. The red-bearded lord did not mind it. He yelled, interrupted
Thomas, also drunken and yelling, to find out details, roared with
laughter, demanded songs, sent for his minstrel but forgot it at
once, cried for the barrels of Chios wine to be brought into. “You
see, Sir Thomas, all the merchant folk drag their caravans past
this place. For my protection and for the castle construction and
for they, bloody suckers, crucified our Christ… That’s how I got
those few barrels. Or few <emphasis>dozen</emphasis>? My steward swears they
topped over hundred last week… I have deep cellars. Two scores of
slaves died while digging and covering them with stone…”</p>

<p>“Sir Gorvel,” Thomas asked, “have you settled
forever? Won’t you return to Britain?”</p>

<p>Gorvel stopped roaring with friendly laughter
and got serious. He drained his cup in one gulp, thundered it down
on the table. “My soul is Anglic! I’d rather herd cows on the banks
of Don, my home river in Sheffield, than rule a kingdom here! Alas,
my king commanded to build a fortress. We are few here, and Saracen
as many as grits in a desert. We can only be safe in castles:
Saracen are bad at taking them. Still bad…”</p>

<p>“You’ve built it fast!”</p>

<p>“We had to erect a mound,” Gorvel complained.
“All this land was as flat and bald as my confessor’s head! See him
there, at the table? They dragged stone from across the river and a
mile over. Lots of men drowned, but I had the rampart raised in two
weeks! Only then I set to the castle.”</p>

<p>“A strategist decision,” Thomas praised.
“You’ve seen me in battles, yeah? The King appreciates me, but he
did right to bestow this land on <emphasis>you</emphasis>, to make <emphasis>you</emphasis> a
lord! And I’m still a knight errant, ‘cause I’m no fit for a
seignior.”</p>

<p>Gorvel squinted at him. “May we change
places?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Thomas shivered, as if an icicle fell under
his collar. “Not for the world!” he replied ingenuously.</p>

<p>Gorvel burst out laughing, but his eyes were
sad. The monk poured the rest of wine into his cup, sent a servant
for a new jug. Gorvel commented it with assumed merriment, “Due to
the caravan road, I have wines of Chios, Mazandaran, Liss,
Darkover, even of Zurbagan. If they made me a watchdog, I’d rather
be one on a rich market than in a poor village!”</p>

<p>Long after midnight, Gorvel’s wife, Lady
Roveg, left the feast. Soon after her leave, a serving maid bent to
Chachar’s ear and hinted in whisper that a decent woman should not
remain in the company of drunken men anymore, as their jokes had
become even more vulgar and their songs scabrous.</p>

<p>Chachar stood up with great reluctance. No
way to tell that she’d heard saltier things and preferred the
company of men to any other. She doesn’t like women, neither they
like her, offending her out of fear<emphasis>.</emphasis> The maid led her to the
vast chambers of Gorvel’s son, Roland, Odoacer, or Theodoric
(Gorvel had not decided on the name for his firstborn son still,
though he dismissed flatly any of his wife’s hints that the stars
heralded a girl to be born.)</p>

<p>Chachar turned and tossed in the luxurious
bed for a long time: the chamber was too vast, she felt exposed,
like in the middle of a city square. Sleep escaped her. Something
was scratching and rustling under the bed, so she dared not to put
her feet down on the floor. She wrapped herself in the blanket up
with her head, but the night was too hot and stuffy, she bathed in
sweat. Finally, Chachar stood on the bed, looked around, and jumped
down on the floor, trying to land as far as possible from the
bed.</p>

<p>The single faint lamp lit grey squares of the
stone wall, leaving the rest of the room pitch-dark. Chachar made
the wick longer. The oil blazed up, as her eyes did, when she saw a
sparkling mirror framed in wood on the wall next to her. Not the
polished bronze plate her previous home had, but a true bright
mirror where she could really see herself!</p>

<p>The mirror was sided by bare daggers. One had
a big spider sitting on it, its belly whitish, its eyes gleaming
strangely in the yellow light. Chachar stepped away warily, but not
so far as to lose the sight of her reflection in the mirror. She
turned around, moved her eyebrows, bent her slender waist. The roar
of rude male voices and tipsy singing came from below, and she saw
that the reflection’s cheeks flashed cheerfully, her eyes lit up,
her breasts rose, their hard nipples stuck against the fine fabric
of her nightgown. She always felt better with men, while in women’s
company she faded – like a butterfly with pollen wiped roughly off
her wings.</p>

<p>Hesitantly, she glanced back at the dark bed,
so gloomy and scary to sleep alone in: she couldn’t help expecting
a hairy black hand to emerge from beneath and grab her. She pushed
the door, walked out warily into the dark corridor.</p>

<p>She saw a light moving far ahead and hurried
to it until she saw a lit face, red and puffy, pieces of felt armor
with iron plates sewed on them. The soldier reeked of wine. He gave
her an indifferent once-over, nodded at the stairs. “Still feast
here in hall! Hungry you? Come down, help need in kitchen. And
you’ll gorge there!”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” Chachar said. The old
soldier, flattered by her words, threw out his chest, raised the
torch proudly as if it were his lance and he were the knight riding
into the royal tournament.</p>

<p>Chachar approached the ajar door of the big
hall, peeped into with caution. The feast was lavish but the wooden
armchairs and the bench facing them empty. Gorvel’s wife and the
pale young man disappeared. The monk was sitting at another table,
eating and drinking for three. He dropped goblets and copper cups,
yelled obscene songs, even tried to dance.</p>

<p>Chachar stepped aside without being seen,
slunk tip-toe along the corridor until she heard voices from behind
the last door. She listened, tidied her hair, set ajar the door
timidly.</p>

<p>In a big chamber, Gorvel and Thomas sat near
the blazing fireplace. Lady Roveg was seated regally in a luxurious
armchair besides. All three of them listened attentively to the
young man singing and playing lute. His fingers ran across the
strings briskly, his voice sounded so manly and beautiful that
Chachar forgave him at once his arrogant face and malevolent fishy
eyes.</p>

<p>Thomas was the first to spot the door ajar.
Chachar tried to move away, but the knight whispered something to
Gorvel who replied with a broad smile. Chachar knew that sort of
understanding grins. Thomas stood up and, stepping as softly as he
could, came out to her.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” she told him in a plaintive
voice. “Can’t sleep.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at her from above. He smelled
of good wine, strong man’s body, sweat, and something special that
made her gasp for air and her heart beat faster. She felt her
cheeks flush as red roses. Thick blush covered even her neck, only
her breasts, high and sensual, remained snow white. Thomas looked
down involuntarily. In sweet presentiment, Chachar saw the effort
it took him to take eyes off the low neck where her waving breasts
rose eagerly to meet his keen gaze.</p>

<p>“What chamber did my friend Gorvel allot
you?” he asked in a suddenly hoarse voice. His eyes turned in their
sockets in spite of himself. Chachar felt his ardent gaze moving on
her tender skin, leaving a red trace of blush.</p>

<p>“A floor above,” she answered and dropped her
eyes to let the knight look where he would. “The chamber of his
future heir.”</p>

<p>“Or a heiress,” he said with a hoarse laugh.
“Would you… like to see round my friend’s castle? Now that you
can’t sleep in such a stuffy night… Maybe a storm’s coming? I also
feel somewhat anxious…”</p>

<p>“I’ll be happy to stroll around the castle
with you, Sir Thomas. The walk may help me to sleep…”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back at the monstrously thick
wall. “Well then… let’s start from the bottom? And finish on the
watchtower, under the sky and stars. I’ve never seen such big stars
before!”</p>

<p>“Neither have I,” she confessed and went
first, feeling his gaze on her back. Her cheeks were so burning
that they felt nipped. She was glad she had put no excess clothing
on: her well-built body, always inspiring men to reach out for it,
was seen through the nightgown even in the dim torchlight. Back at
the feast, the Saracen stared at her, the red-bearded host glanced
approvingly, stripping her off with his eyes, and even the
fishy-eyed minstrel was looking at her too intently, to Lady
Rovig’s obvious vexation!</p>

<p>They went descending by steep stairs. It was
moist and chilly down there. Chachar kept close to Thomas: she felt
creepy, and the knight walked by her side, mighty and handsome, a
true man from head to foot, so at the first opportunity she
screamed with fear and seized his hand. So they proceeded: she
trembled and nestled up to him in fear, as the shadows thickened
and moved in such a way as if this newly built castle were already
haunted.</p>

<p>Down in the cellar, they faced a massive iron
door. Thomas sniffed, his chest puffed up, he pushed the iron folds
hastily. From inside, there came a cold moist air of deep
underground – and such a powerful smell of wine that Thomas reeled.
In the dim crimson light of the torch he held overhead, they could
see three high bulging rows, as though formed by lying
buffalos.</p>

<p>“Three rows of wine barrels!” Chachar
exclaimed in astonishment. “Why does he need that much?”</p>

<p>“I know that man!” Thomas laughed. “He deems
it an offense to drink water when there’s any wine within two miles
around. And now, in his own castle by the cross of caravan
roads…”</p>

<p>Chachar looked in the knight’s laughing face,
with crimson lights dancing on it, and descended into the cellar
bravely. The stairs had sharp edges, not worn still, the ground
beneath her feet smelled of untrodden freshness. Poles and boars
jutted out of the rows here and there. The wine barrels formed
three rows: two along the walls and one in the middle, sided by
passages as wide as a man’s arms spread: such breadth is convenient
for rolling out the barrel you need. The monstrous casks of thick
oaken planks towered on each other so high that Chachar shook her
head in amazement. “More than one can drink in hundred years!”</p>

<p>“And one with friends?” Thomas asked
merrily.</p>

<p>“Well, maybe in fifty…”</p>

<p>“Gorvel’s a brave knight but not the one to
miss profit. He always had a transport of loot following him.
That’s why he’s a lord here and I’m going home. He’ll sell the
wine, buy something else, then sell again… We’ll hear of a new
kingdom soon, Chachar!”</p>

<p>He stuck the torch into an iron rest. Chachar
turned to him at once, her eyes glittered. She put hands on his
chest, feeling a broad curved plate of muscle under her fingers.
Below it, his heart, as huge as a hammer, pounded steadily, each
new beat of it stronger and faster. Chachar smiled triumphantly,
reached for his lips with her own… Thomas took her by
shoulders.</p>

<p>The ringing silence, when both of them only
heard his rattling breath, was suddenly broken by heavy footsteps.
Thomas glanced around, slapped involuntarily his heap where the
sword hilt used to be. Two broad-shouldered warriors in gleaming
iron helmets were coming downstairs to the cellar. Thomas could not
see their faces, but bare swords in their hands cast ominous
crimson lights around. They walked alerted, as if in search for
somebody, holding their curved one-edged Saracen swords a bit
slantwise, as the hirelings of East are used to. Their habits gave
them out as Saracens… and good fighters.</p>

<p>He moved Chachar behind his back and
whispered, “You know them?”</p>

<p>“Never saw them before…”</p>

<p>Thomas froze behind the barrels but the
warriors could not see them. The two men walked slowly, protecting
each other. Oblivious, Thomas flung his hand to the heap, and his
fingers only felt linen fabric. However, he had a short dagger on
his belt!</p>

<p>The warriors descended from the stairs onto
the ground, stood there for a while until their eyes accommodated
to the faint light. One of them whispered to another, and they went
forward cautiously, bending down in a predatory way.</p>

<p>“Chachar,” Thomas whispered. “Crouch behind
this barrel! Let them pass by, then run to the stairs”</p>

<p>“They’ll see me!” she mouthed.</p>

<p>“They’ll see <emphasis>me</emphasis>, not you.”</p>

<p>“But you?..”</p>

<p>“I’ll try to keep them. And you raise an
alarm when you’re out. Or run straight to Gorvel. He’s two floors
above.”</p>

<p>She crouched, hiding in the shade. Thomas
backed, his eyes fixed on the Saracens. Something crunched under
his foot. Both warriors gave a start, hurried to his side with
their broad blades advanced. One had his sword in right hand,
another – in the left. However, they did not rush headlong.
<emphasis>Definitely no novices at man hunt.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas ran back, hiding behind the rows of
barrels. Poles crunched underfoot, marking his way. Finally, both
warriors saw his gliding shadow and increased their pace – but did
not broke into run as Thomas hoped them to. His heart was wrung in
the fingers of fear. <emphasis>Will the innocent woman have time to escape
assassins?</emphasis> He had no doubt they <emphasis>were</emphasis> assassins. He’d
seen too much of life to confuse wine with vinegar or a priest with
a vagrant.</p>

<p>The warriors parted and ran along the edges
of the passage, all but brushing against the barrels. Thomas pulled
out his dagger, turned it in hand angrily: it was so tiny and
toy-like as against a huge two-handed sword. <emphasis>The two of those
have smaller swords. Curved Arabian ones, but real swords, no toys
like this.</emphasis></p>

<p>They slowed down their pace, started coming
from both sides, as far as the walls of barrels allowed, their
tenacious eyes caught every move of the cornered knight. Thomas
weighed the dagger in hand, recalled his friend wielding this
strange weapon artfully – and hurled it into the warrior in four
steps. The dagger hit his chest forcefully, rebounded, fell on the
earthen floor, and bounced under the barrels. The warrior recoiled.
Thomas could not see his face in the shade but heard his croak of
suppressed laughter. “Bad luck?.. You should have learnt!”</p>

<p>His sword cut the air abruptly. The second
man dashed to at once, raising his sword. Thomas pushed off
strongly, jumped up on the barrel and to another one. There was a
loud crack behind, a splash on his legs. The assassin cursed in
Arabic as he pulled his sword out of the cut barrel.</p>

<p>His companion cried, “Keep him there! I’ll
bar the door. He won’t escape!”</p>

<p>Thomas measured by eye the distance to the
one who remained beneath. The assassin smiled malevolently, waved
his free hand in an invitation to come and try to take him while he
was alone. He held his sword loosely, but Thomas could tell the one
whose failures had added to his experience apart from a greenhorn.
If only he had not thrown the dagger that stupid…</p>

<p>He climbed like a monkey on dump wooden
barrels, his cheeks blushed with shame and humiliation. <emphasis>At four
steps! By flat side! A miss would have been better than that…</emphasis>
He wished Chachar had time to slip out while they were driving him
on the very top…</p>

<p>He heard a clang of the door barred by the
second warrior. They started to come from both sides. Thomas
climbed on the topmost cask but he had barely jerked his foot away
when the lower edge was cut off by blade. He jumped to save his
feet, fell down, his hands found the next barrel. Another sword
flashed into the cask from beneath and nearly chopped his fingers
off.</p>

<p>Thomas swore, fell, rolled over the barrel,
stopped in a hollow between round sides. He heard them laugh below.
One started to climb carefully, another stared at Thomas without a
blink, his sword ready. The first man struck, Thomas jumped on the
next barrel. The blade crunched through the wooden side, the
warrior pulled it out, brandished again. Thomas crouched, ready to
jump. The assassin waited, then brandished several times, trying to
reach him. His last blow was brisk and treacherous. Thomas flew up.
What saved him up to the moment was their swords being heavy, no
light sabers – that gave him time to evade the crushing blows of
sharp steel. All the same, he felt a cold in his chest. <emphasis>The
cat-and-mouse game has a single end: a mouse unable to hit
back…</emphasis></p>

<p>They were surrounding. Thomas jumped along
the row, from one barrel to another, as if they were backs of giant
turtles. Everything in the damp cellar was moldy or covered with
slime. His legs ached with effort to keep himself from falling
down.</p>

<p>There were three barrels ahead, then the end
of the row. Driven skillfully to his inescapable end, Thomas saw
his death, heard his wings flap overhead. Gathering the last of his
strength, he jumped suddenly from the middle row to another. The
assassin’s late strike slashed the sole of his boot. Thomas didn’t
make the jump, his chest hit against the wooden edge, but he jerked
his legs up instantly, got onto the barrel and rolled away. He
heard a crack, then curses and gurgling, the smell of wine grew
stronger. Behind him, they swore and shouted angrily.</p>

<p>Thomas ran along the row, his shoulder
brushing against the wall, jumped down on the ground. Limping, he
rushed for the door. He heard a footfall behind, but the door was
already close. He seized the iron cramps, flung the bar away with a
crash, seized the second one… The footsteps got so close that he,
having removed the second bar and pulled the door open, was forced
to dart headfirst down the stairs. A steel clanged loudly on steel,
a sword swished through his hair and barely cut his ear off.</p>

<p>He fell, his forehead hit against the cask
bottom. The door banged shut, the bars clanged again. He saw a
familiar glitter on the ground between barrels, grabbed the thing
before he realized what it was, heard footsteps and made, with
inscrutable speed, his way onto the top of the cask wall. In
surprise, Thomas gazed at his clenched fist: it held his dagger by
hilt.</p>

<p>Both assassins breathed heavily. “Stop
jumping as a cowardly monkey!” one said in a guttural voice. “Climb
down, be a man.”</p>

<p>“You are not a true knight,” another
accused.</p>

<p>“Better you come up here,” Thomas invited.
His breath wheezed out, his throat was dry.</p>

<p>“We’ll have to.”</p>

<p>They started climbing on the barrels. Thomas
slashed briskly the thick rope keeping the row together. Huge,
monstrous wine vessels started sliding apart. At first, the
warriors didn’t mind the barrels moving but then they heard a heavy
rustle, a groan of dump wood. One jumped off, his sword advanced,
the other was still gripping at the side of the huge barrel. It
turned round slowly and rolled along with others, speeding up, so
he came off, fell on his back, the sword still in hand.</p>

<p>Thomas hung on the scrap of the rope, as
thick as a ship one, dangling in the air. The barrels were rolling
apart from beneath his feet. The first assassin ran away in fear,
but the heavy casks rolling down from a high row were fast to gain
speed. The second one was barely up to his feet when a barrel
knocked him down and rolled over him. Thomas heard his bones and
skull crunch, his chest clap like a burst bull bladder, saw blood
gushing from beneath the cask. In the shady cellar, the villain’s
blood seemed as dark as tar.</p>

<p>For a moment, Thomas saw a flattened spot.
<emphasis>Like an animal’s skin taken off and lying by the bed on the
castle floor in winter.</emphasis> Then another barrels rolled over,
thundering, pushing among themselves, and Thomas could not see the
sprawled body anymore.</p>

<p>The first one had almost reached the wall but
the enormous wine-gurgling monsters ran him down and rumpled. The
casks cracked, the powerful smell of wines made Thomas’s head
dizzy. He felt more drunken than ever before.</p>

<p>That was when he heard a thundering sound.
The door shook, all but flying off its hinges. Thomas released the
rope and landed with a shriek, “I’ll open, just a moment!”</p>

<p>His feet slipped in the puddles of wine, he
fell trice, got all covered with mud, struggled up the stairs. Once
he removed the bars, the door flung him away. He cried, fell back
into the wine puddle. Sir Gorvel with two soldiers, all armed,
appeared in the doorstep. Behind them, he heard Chachar squealing
and saw a glitter of helmets, armor, and bare swords.</p>

<p>He felt strong hands on his shoulders,
struggled up to his feet. It was Gorvel looking at him with
anxiety, his eyes all but popped out. “Sir Thomas! If you wanted a
spree, why alone? It’s not friendly. I’ve never treated you like
that!”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head drunkenly. “Oh, Sir
Gorvel… Would I ever do such a thing to your wine cellar if not in
a grave need?”</p>

<p>“Never mind the wine!” Gorvel dismissed.
“What had happened? The woman was jabbering but I got not a damned
thing of it, with all that wine gurgling in my head… Anyway, I’m no
match for you, sir Thomas. You reek of wine as if you had some
forty barrels!”</p>

<p>“No, only three or four,” Thomas comforted.
“No more… I mean them damaged. Gave a leak… You may laugh, Sir
Gorvel, but I had no lick of your wine at all…”</p>

<p>Gorvel roared with laughter eagerly. Sir
Thomas could barely keep his feet, his eyes rolling under his
forehead, his tongue tied. If soon he visited the wine cellar, the
purpose must have been other than a talk of sublime love!</p>

<p>Afterwards Thomas was asking himself what the
hell made him go to that cellar but found no reasonable answer. The
only explanation he discovered was that no logics can be found
where a woman is involved.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter
8</p>

<p>Oleg was sprawled on his bed awake, fingering
his charms. The faint moonlight fell through the guarded window,
only part of the bed lit by it. Oleg had estimated how he would lie
for sleep to keep his face away from the ghastly light.</p>

<p>His fingers quivered, lingering for long on
small wooden figures. He felt his back creepy as he saw every road
coming to a dead end. <emphasis>Danger on the right and on the left, above
and below, looking into the window and waiting on the stairs.</emphasis>
The charm with a double heart meant danger not only for him but for
his. <emphasis>But who is mine here?</emphasis> If only not that odd knight with
his noble ways… Then nothing was clear at all. <emphasis>Who can link me
to the knight and want both of us dead? What can link us together
at all?</emphasis></p>

<p>He closed his eyes and concentrated on his
feelings as he ran the wooden figures through his fingers slowly
once more. A charm stuck between his thumb and forefinger – the one
with the sword and arrows again! <emphasis>Gods persist in warning.</emphasis> In
the daily turmoil, it is not always possible to see the signs of a
coming trouble or to hear own soul: all-seeing, all-hearing,
all-understanding. Sometimes the voice of soul comes in a dream,
and the one wakes up enlightened, happy with having invented or
discovered a thing in his sleep! <emphasis>Sometimes you hear it early in
the morning, while still half-asleep, with your head clean and free
of mundane stuff, but only a sorcerer can seclude from the world
and listen to his soul. Charms are the simplest tool through which
the soul can speak, give a hint or a warning…</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg slipped off the bed quietly, his blanket
left bulging, and hid underneath. He kept fingering his charms when
he heard a soft rustle outside the window. The chamber went dark as
if something had screened the window. He seemed to hear a breath
held, then a resonant click: Oleg knew that sound of a metal
crossbow string. He uttered a short groan, pulled the dangling edge
of the blanket down a little, pushed the wooden bed from
beneath,</p>

<p>Oleg listened, slipped out briskly, a knife
in hand ready for a throw. A short metal arrow was stuck in the
thick head of the bed, the blanket pierced through by it. The arrow
point had a deep groove in it. Oleg touched the arrow, feeling the
warmth of a stranger’s palm, tugged it out. It was deep in the
oaken head of the bed, almost half through it. However, the
strength of the shooter’s arm could never be known with a crossbow.
<emphasis>A child will shoot it with the same strength as a man grown.</emphasis>
At once Oleg was near the window, seized the metal rods, strained
himself. He heard the rustle of stone crumbs, then the rods bent
and, with a faint grind, went off their stone jacks. The court yard
was silent save cattle lowing in the barn and a young silly dog
yelping behind the outhouses. The moon, with its edge nibbled,
floated the sky deadly.</p>

<p>Oleg squeezed himself through the window,
scraping his shoulders. His fingertips felt stone ledges and
cracks. Gorvel’s castle was almost impregnable, as Franks saw it,
but a brave skilled climber or a daredevil could climb its walls up
to the roof easily. <emphasis>Franks will have to learn much by a bitter,
gory experience. The assassins of Saracen are capable of much more
than pompous European knights or simple-minded common folk.</emphasis></p>

<p>Pressing himself to the wall, he climbed down
slowly, stopping and listening. He heard someone descending on the
left, hidden by salience of the tower wall. <emphasis>Not a very good
climber: he pants, knocks on stones.</emphasis> To judge from the sounds,
the climber was clad in mail or light armor. <emphasis>Definitely, he’s no
Saracen: assassins always go light, nothing excessive on. They
condemn Franks, even while serving them, for taking no step without
a pood</emphasis><emphasis><sup>9</sup></emphasis> <emphasis>of iron on their
shoulders.</emphasis> He might well be a European. <emphasis>The one eager to
learn from Saracens, otherwise he’d not dare to climb a sheer wall
in the dead of night. He’d have pleaded tradition, the good Anglic
sword strike, or even the valor of the Knights of the Round Table,
to refuse flatly.</emphasis></p>

<p>The stars rocked overhead, but Oleg proceeded
down, into the pitch dark. The roofs and the top of walls are
moonlit, while the court all covered with impenetrable black
shadows cast by the walls. The top of the tethering post is
glittering as a lone island in the sea of darkness.</p>

<p>When he smelled the ground close, the
crossbowman jumped down. Oleg heard his boots on the stone paves,
unclasped his hands at once, never minding the noise: his bare feet
made no sound. With his heart wrung with fear, he ran across the
moonlit patch in the middle of the yard, plunged head first into
the salutary shade and stopped dead, listening. The heavy footsteps
were far ahead.</p>

<p>Oleg’s eyes accommodated, and he made out the
figure of a man running away, a metal glitter of his back. <emphasis>The
crossbowman didn’t left his expensive weapon.</emphasis> The murderer ran
up to the rampart, started climbing it. His limbs moved swiftly, as
if he were a spider on the web.</p>

<p>Oleg sneaked slowly to the wall. The
crossbowman was climbing a rope but Oleg had to make it on the bare
stone, gripping at the smallest cracks and ledges. When the man
screened the stars over the wall for a moment, Oleg was in the
middle of it. When he reached the top himself, he heard the clatter
of hooves and a muffled neigh in the dark beneath. A horse with a
rider in flapping cloak burst out of the shade and galloped away
from the castle.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped down from the very top, fell on
the edge of the moat, rolled down the slope, reducing his speed. He
heard crackles and crunches under his body, felt his bare feet
pricked, as if some fish and bird bones had been thrown down from
the castle walls for ages. The clatter of hooves was fading away
fast. Oleg rushed after, unfastened his jacket at once. The earth
beneath his bare feet was pleasant cool, the morning air chilly and
sharp as a Damask saber. He’d get warmer in his run, so it was the
cold, not the warmth, he needed to preserve. The crossbowman drove
his horse in an even gallop, evidently sparing its strength for a
long ride.</p>

<p><emphasis>Few people know, while the rest are
charmed by the might of horse muscle and suppressed by own
laziness, that no horse can run as fast and far as man can! In a
run for half a verst</emphasis><emphasis><sup>10</sup></emphasis> <emphasis>the horse will
come first, but at a longer distance it will run short of its
breath or even fall, while a man can run ten versts and longer with
the same speed, in full armor!</emphasis> Ruses were trained to run in
armor, with shield and axe in hands, two-handed sword on the back,
throwing knives on the belt or hidden under a flap, and
<emphasis>akinak</emphasis>, a short Scythian sword, at the top of the boot. That
sword was typically referred to as <emphasis>a knee thing for strife</emphasis>,
abbreviated to <emphasis>knife</emphasis>.</p>

<p>Dust rose over the road as a subtle cloud. As
Oleg ran, he glanced at either the fat-lightening sky or the
distant sparkle of metal plate on the crossbow stock. The clatter
of hooves was distinct in the night silence: even birds had not
roused yet, no songs, and Oleg’s bare feet raised the dust without
a sound.</p>

<p>Finally, the sound of hooves died away, but
the pale light of dawn enabled Oleg to see the tracks, dim and dark
on the road ahead. The far edge of the land was going pink. If the
crossbowman turned aside, into the thickets, he would be easy to
trace. Hoof prints, broken branches, trampled grass – all the signs
for an experienced eye to know the rider’s way.</p>

<p>His breath burst out hoarse and hot, his
throat overdried. Oleg realized he was going tired like a huge fish
thrown onshore. His cave was not much for running about, so he
broke off the habit to exercise. And the advantage of his previous
experience would not suffice alone…</p>

<p>Panting of the run, he thought suddenly the
crossbowman might have experience too. And there were many other
dangers: a snake lurking in the rotten leaves, under a log, or
within an empty horse skull…</p>

<p>The traces turned off the road suddenly, Oleg
had barely run past but, however, he broke into the shrubs at once
and saw deep hoof prints in the damp ground. He felt the coolness
of stream ahead. By that sensation, Oleg could draw the twists of
it, tell its depth, and name all the grasses and flowers on its
banks. He heard the clatter of hooves again. The horse’s pace was
even, thick blades of juicy grass crunched in its teeth.</p>

<p>The clouds blazed up in the sky, the dawn
came down to the ground from them. The sand turned orange and
shining, the rich grass sparkled with all the tints of green.</p>

<p>In a two or three hundred steps ahead, in the
curve of the stream, a shelter of newly cut branches stood. It was
made skillfully: Oleg could barely single its sloping walls out in
the surrounding greenery. The rider, with a crossbow over
shoulders, trotted straight to the shelter. When he was in ten
steps from it, a small man in long green oriental robe went out of
the bushes on the right. He had a simple bow of ash stick, with a
tightly stretched string, in hand.</p>

<p>The rider waved his hand reassuringly from a
distance. “I’m friend! You are hard to be taken by surprise,
master, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“How was it?” the man in green robe
interrupted.</p>

<p>“I’ve pinned him like a toad, to the back of
the bed. This Frankish crossbow makes a terrible strike! But it
takes so long to draw the string with a winch… And this bloody
double traction!” He vaulted off, clapped his excited horse by
neck, took the saddle and harness off and shouldered them. “Good
horse, fast as wind… Chukan and Gexah still there?”</p>

<p>“Their job is harder,” the man in robe
replied. “The knight is brave, his armor always on him, even as he
shits in the bushes. He has to be caught. That’s not shooting down
a weaponless pilgrim!”</p>

<p>The rider kept his hot horse from rushing to
the cold stream, slapped and patted the animal. “That pilgrim is
more like a bear!” he said with displeasure. “I smelled danger,
though he had no armor nor arms!”</p>

<p>Oleg took his throwing knives out, estimated
by eye the distance to the crossbowman and his master. Oleg’s heart
beat like mad, protesting against a sudden stop of the run. Big
beads of sweat ran down from his forehead, broke through the dams
of eyebrows to bite eyes. His fingers felt wet, he wiped them on
his knees.</p>

<p>The man in green robe glanced with a sullen
approval at the crossbowman who was leading his horse round to cool
it and keep it, steamed, from drinking icy water. “It’s done. I
hope it is! Chukan and Gexah never missed before… Just think: five
thousand dinars for a cup! That’s fantastic!”</p>

<p>“In silver?” the crossbowman asked,
grinning.</p>

<p>“In gold, you fool. A single shot earned you
a thousand golden dinars! See it? Where else could you have earned
that much?”</p>

<p>The rider shook his head in astonishment. “A
thousand in gold?!”</p>

<p>“A thousand. Chukan and Gexah will get each
that much. And two thousands are mine, for I’ve planned it all and
directed you three, skilled with knives and arrows but weak at
brains.”</p>

<p>“I don’t object,” the crossbowman said
hastily. “You always had a bigger share. But we’ve never got that
much… That seems queer. When we set a king with arrows, after we
passed three lines of his bodyguards, we received less. And here –
kill a knight and a pilgrim, take a cup… And that’s all?”</p>

<p>“Why should it matter? Do what they want but
don’t ask why. In fact, I’ve grasped it was sufficient to take the
cup only but they once had it go wrong. Either stolen or taken
back…”</p>

<p>“I see. Dead won’t come to take it back. A
thousand in gold, Ganim! For this money I shall…”</p>

<p>The heavy crossbow, with a long polished
butt, fidgeted on the rider’s back. Oleg waited until the other man
turned face to him while leading the horse round. The knife slipped
out of Oleg’s hand like a silver fish. He took the second knife at
once, flung into the back of the green-robed man whom the
crossbowman called Ganim. The crossbowman jerked his arms up as if
he wanted to fly, fell on his back, dropping the reins, and stayed
motionless: his mouth wide open in a silent cry, his right eye a
gurgling bloody mess, with the knife hilt jutting out of it.</p>

<p>The green-robed man stood with his back
turned to Oleg, but some beastly feeling made him wheel round. He
drew his bow at once, shot. Oleg jerked aside, caught the arrow
with hand. The robed man, baring teeth in fury, scratched the knife
handle sticking out in his chest: the blade had crushed through the
breastbone. He began to draw his bow again. In ten steps, Oleg
alerted. Ganim drew it and put down several times, seizing a
moment: if the pilgrim could catch an arrow with his left hand, he
could manage it with his right too…</p>

<p>Finally, Ganim’s fingers unclenched, he fell
to his knees, half dead. The bow dropped out. His eyes flashed and
faded, he fell on his side, his arm bent clumsily. A blood puddle
was spreading from beneath him. His other hand scratched the ground
for a while, then stiffened.</p>

<p>Oleg came from aside, stopped in three steps.
“You’re not dead,” he told Ganim, “so leave my knife’s hilt. Look
at me.”</p>

<p>Ganim made no move. His quivering fingers
straightened. Oleg came from behind, turned him with a knock and
recoiled. Suddenly, Ganim jumped from the ground. His left hand
flung a handful of earth into Oleg’s face, his right one pulled the
knife out of his chest and struck, with lightning speed, the spot
where Oleg should been standing. But the earth flew past Oleg, he
elbowed the knife away, seized Ganim’s hand and twisted it
fiercely. Ganim screamed, fell to his knees.</p>

<p>Oleg twisted it further. He heard bones
crack, tendons burst with a crunch. Ganim’s face hit on the ground,
which was wet with blood. The red spilled out from his chest in an
uneven trickle, pulsing in time with his quivering heart.</p>

<p>“I have not missed,” Oleg told him
pressingly. “I wanted to ask, that’s why you are still alive… Who
paid five thousands in gold?”</p>

<p>With effort, Ganim turned his face. It was
caked in bloody mud, his eyes and mouth closed up with it. “You’ll
be destroyed both…” he croaked. “No one can stand up to their
might!”</p>

<p>“Names!” Oleg demanded. He twisted the
enemy’s hand, the last gristles crunched, Ganim stopped twitching.
His strength was drained fast with the blood loss. Oleg hit him by
shoulder blade, heard a dry crunch, seized the fragments, as thin
as bird bones, and started rubbing their blooded ends, with marrow
flowing out of them, against each other. “Say it!” he demanded
fiercely. “Say it now!”</p>

<p>Ganim wheezed with terrible pain, twitched,
his lips foamed. Oleg seized his private parts with another hand
and squeezed. The new pain made Ganim toss up, his pallid face went
black, a wheezing voice escaped his lips. “I’ll say… It was… in
person…”</p>

<p>He tossed up again, his body flinched, then
stretched like a log, gave a last quiver, like grass in the wind,
and froze. His face looked more awful than a strangled man’s one,
his goggled eyes were full of terror. Oleg sighed, closed his eyes,
folded his arms on his chest.</p>

<p>The crossbowman lay still. The blade had gone
deep into his brain. Oleg pulled the hilt with caution, to overcome
the resistance but avoid being spattered. He wiped the knives
clean, then put them into covers. Both entered their nests
reluctantly, like the swords of minstrels’ songs that screamed with
joy (swords, not songs) each time when unsheathed and cried with
grief when leaving the battle.</p>

<p>Searching the shelter of branches, he found a
well-hidden leather bag with gold coins, weighed it in hand. <emphasis>If
these are golden dinars, they number in no less than five thousand…
Someone is craving for the cup desperately.</emphasis> So craving that he
ordered to kill two in his way: a knight, hero of the capture of
Jerusalem, and a peaceful pilgrim. <emphasis>Now the knight must be
beating off two killers, if still alive.</emphasis> He might have been
invincible in jousting and heroic as a member of attacking knightly
force, but Saracen assassins were harder nuts to crack. The poor
knight might already be wheezing with his throat cut, his hot blood
shedding the ground…</p>

<p>He hid the gold in a different place, went
around the shelter in broadening circles. He saw lots of hoof
prints. On the wet ground near the stream they were so distinct
that he could easily count every nail and dent in iron horseshoes.
However, the sun rose high in the sky before he identified the
horse of the mysterious employer, the one who had brought five
thousands of golden dinars.</p>

<p>Oleg ran, watching the tracks on the earth
and patches of trampled grass, listening to the birds crying and
grasshoppers chirring. <emphasis>A steppe is a whole being. An experienced
ear on the one end of it will grasp easily what’s going on
another.</emphasis></p>

<p>He ran in wide steps, keeping his elbows
behind, so that his chest breathed in deeply and mightily without
squeezing his heart. In hundred steps on the left, a magpie flew
out of a bush with an indignant scream. At once, Oleg slowed his
run down to a walk, his eyes fixed on the suspicious bush, his hand
on the knife hilt.</p>

<p>His eyes were still on the veil of green
leaves, trying to penetrate through the bush, when he heard a soft
voice behind, “Here, slave!”</p>

<p>From behind a thick log, a dried-up sinewy
man stood up, clad in a thin mail with wide collar. He had a curved
sword on his belt and bow in hands, an arrow on the string. Oleg
recognized Ternak, a slave hunter who had impeded his homecoming
and had Abdulla bring him to Baron Otset’s stone quarry.</p>

<p>“Didn’t expect?” Ternak flung out, his eyes
narrowed fiercely. His upper lip jerked up in a predatory smile,
baring yellow teeth. “Was it you, with that blockhead knight, who
raised the mutiny? Though it doesn’t matter anymore. The castle now
has another master. I see you managed to kill Ganim and his man. I
had little love for them, but I have even less for those who
succeed in killing such…”</p>

<p>He failed to find a proper word. Meanwhile,
his hands drew the bow string. He expected to see fear in the face
of the runaway slave, desired it, but Oleg kept his expression as
impenetrable as he could, despite his thoughts jumping like
gudgeons on a hot pan. <emphasis>How did Ternak happen to be here? Did he
follow us all the way?</emphasis></p>

<p>“Did <emphasis>you</emphasis> hire Ganim?” he asked, making
no move.</p>

<p>Ternak smirked, his eyes blazed with
malevolence. “Those in Hell know all. Ask them!” He aimed at Oleg,
shifting the pointed arrowhead between his face and breast.</p>

<p>Oleg did not stir. “Why does your partner
hide? He may come out.”</p>

<p>“What partner?”</p>

<p>“In that bush. A magpie flew out,” Oleg
pointed with his finger.</p>

<p>Ternak did not move an eye, replied with a
smirk. “I’m no greenhorn to be entrapped that easy.”</p>

<p>The bow string clicked. Oleg jerked aside. He
would have caught the arrow flying, but changed his mind at the
last moment (what use of arrow in hand if Ternak draws his sword
out?), so his hand reached the throwing knife.</p>

<p>Ternak knew fighting ways. Oleg was late to
grasp it. He felt a strike on his side, touched the hurt place: the
arrow stuck out there! Ternak smiled, happy of his outwit, bow
still in hands, but his smile seemed to be curved in wood: the
knife was deep in his breast.</p>

<p>Oleg came up to him, kicked the bow aside.
Pain spread in his side, blood trickled down his clothes, dripped
on the dry ground. Clenching his teeth, he felt the arrow and flesh
around it. With relief, he found out that the iron arrowhead had
slid along his rib, scratching it. There was a swollen bump under
his skin on the other side, as though a nut hidden there.</p>

<p>Holding his breath, he pushed the arrow
deeper into and almost broke his neck, trying to see the place
where the arrowhead would come out. The bump swelled and stretched,
glittering in the burning sun – and suddenly sank, pierced by a
sharp metal point from inside. It was red with blood spurting out
from that new wound. Oleg moved the arrow further quickly until its
jaggy head was all out. Swearing quietly, he broke the wooden
shaft, pulled it out from the other side. The blood went gushing
from both ends of the through wound. Oleg bent hastily over the
dead man to use the thin cloth of his turban as dressing.</p>

<p>A low voice, resembling a roar, ordered
sullenly from behind, “Stand still! No dressing.”</p>

<p>Oleg turned round slowly. From behind the
bush on his left – the one from which the scared magpie had flown
out – Gorvel’s minstrel stood. He was in travelling clothes, his
pale malevolent face alerted, his eyes catching Oleg’s every move,
a small bow of aurochs horn in hands, a curved sword and a long
narrow dagger on his belt. Oleg cast a helpless glance at his
knife, hilt-deep in Ternak’s chest. The singer caught his look and
nodded. “Leave it be. And don’t move. I love to watch the blood
pour out. Even if I was not the one to shed it.”</p>

<p>He smiled malevolently. Oleg saw triumph and
delight in his swamp-greenish eyes. The singer could have killed
him by shot in back through the bush, but then the bloody pilgrim
would have died unaware of his killer, in no torments – and now
he’ll realize that, though he killed Ternak, Ganim and his man,
there are even stronger and more skilled ones. The strong and
skilled minstrel will walk around while the pilgrim’s bones will be
dragged by animals…</p>

<p>“Did you hire Ganim?” Oleg asked in a
depressed voice. He staggered, blood trickled down his leg to soak
into the dry ground. He felt hot and wet within his boot.</p>

<p>The minstrel gave no reply. He bared his
teeth, drew the bow slowly, looking straight in Oleg’s eyes.
Several times he released the string and drew again. Despite the
smirk, his eyes were guarded. They caught every smallest move of
the pilgrim’s muscle. Oleg tried to swing aside but his side burst
with pain, his legs gave way. He heard ringing in his ears. <emphasis>It’s
the loss of blood.</emphasis> He felt his face go pallid – and saw it in
the minstrel’s smirk, his triumphant eyes. “I’ll make a cup of your
skull!” the singer promised. “You <emphasis>were</emphasis> a mighty
warrior…”</p>

<p>“Did you hire him?” Oleg saw the singer’s
smirk and glittering eyes, the rest blurred with hot haze. Suddenly
he glimpsed a move out of the corner of his left eye, looked there
asquint. As Ternak had gripped the hilt of the knife in his chest,
he was still holding it, his fingers weakening, losing touch with
it one by one. In a moment, his hand would fall down into the
grass. “Ternak,” Oleg said insistently, “fling the knife at
him!”</p>

<p>The minstrel shot a glance there. Ternak’s
hand fell with a noise, burying itself in the grass. The singer
shot briskly. His arrow struck Ternak heavily under his thrown-up
chin, went into almost to the feather.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped back and aside once the arrow
left the bow string. He fell into a gully, broke through bushes,
rolled down in a ball until he reached the bottom. The thickets
softened his fall. He hastened to climb above and aside, feeling
giddy, big black flies rushing before his eyes, his blood dripping
on the grass. Twisting, he pulled out his second knife, gripped the
hilt. The minstrel was sure he’d left his only knife in Ternak’s
body. Oleg had made him think so with devouring that knife with
eyes. Now he had a little chance to outwit the minstrel who proved
out to be a skilled and experienced assassin, those three killers
no match for him. <emphasis>It’s strange he has to wander in a singer’s
likeness…</emphasis></p>

<p>He heard a rustle above. Minstrel was coming
slowly down the slope, bow in hands, arrow on the string. He kept
his eyes on the blood stains on the ground and leaves, and he
walked carefully, not ran. He stared at each blade of grass, his
eyes (a match for Oleg’s) missed neither a grasshopper jumping nor
a lizard darting in the grass. At the same time he seemed to notice
what was going on around and even behind him.</p>

<p>Oleg clapped himself mentally on the
shoulder: he had left the bottom of the gully on time. He lay
hidden in the grass, almost in the open space. <emphasis>Such places are
never looked upon closely when sided by thick bushes.</emphasis> A wounded
prey would usually hide behind branches, so the minstrel kept away
from shrubs, ready to shoot an arrow at any suspicious move.</p>

<p>Oleg felt his face muddy. He got dirty all
over, like a pig, while crawling on his belly along the bed of a
lately dried-up stream, but that made him invisible among boulders,
grey and muddy the same. His body was plastered with leaves and dry
grass blades, the clots of earth dangled from his cheeks.</p>

<p>The minstrel stepped with caution. He not
only looked at the bloody trace but glanced around. The red stains
led him to the logs that had stopped Oleg’s fall. The four of them,
with their branches tangled, made a perfect hide. The singer’s lips
curved in a ghost of a triumphant smirk, but he kept moving on in a
guarded and tenacious way. He was an excellent hunter, the one who
would easily trace and kill a wounded bear, or even a lion.</p>

<p>Oleg lay, clinging to the ground, barely
daring to breath. With his left ear pressed to the ground, he heard
every step, every move. He could not see the minstrel but his
intuition informed that he’d passed by and was leaving.</p>

<p>Oleg raised himself a little on trembling
arms and saw a bent back in twenty steps ahead. The singer sneaked,
ready to wheel round at any moment, to jump aside or fall under the
protection of shrubs. He had the bow half-drawn while peering at
the tangle of roots and branches of stout fallen trees. The iron
arrowhead glittered like a big snake’s wet tongue.</p>

<p>Oleg struggled up, trying not to step on his
right leg, numb and disobeying. The singer made ten more steps
away. Oleg aimed clumsily, as if it were his first throw in a
lifetime, and flung the knife. Everything went dark before his
eyes, he lurched and stretched his arms, trying to keep his
feet.</p>

<p>He heard a convulsive sob ahead. The minstrel
wheeled round, his arrow flew over Oleg’s head. The singer’s eyes
were goggled and mad, the last blood flowed away from his cheeks,
and his face went pallid yellow. He seized a second arrow briskly,
shot at Oleg. A click – and the arrow missed. The minstrel bared
his teeth, reeled, blood went trickling out of his mouth. He
kneeled slowly, staring at Oleg with astonishment. The bow slipped
off and down into the grass.</p>

<p>Oleg came up, limping heavily, dragging his
foot. The minstrel coughed, spattering blood on his chin. “You did
it…” he croaked. “I underestimated…”</p>

<p>“Who sent you?” Oleg demanded.</p>

<p>The minstrel made a little wave of head, his
eyes flashed. “No way to force me… I’m dying…”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded sullenly. If the knife struck
where it should have, then the point of the blade had cut through
the spinal muscle and into the heart. “Should I burn or bury you?”
Oleg asked.</p>

<p>Blood gushed out of the singer’s mouth
unevenly, as his heart was still clinging to life. His breast rose
heavily, with a squelch inside, as if a big fish were splashing
there. “I worship fire,” he said in a fading voice.</p>

<p>“All the four elements are sacred,” Oleg
added at once. “I can bury you according to your rite. Would you
speak?”</p>

<p>The minstrel’s eyes were closing, as he
rocked on his knees. Oleg barely heard his whisper, “Take my sword…
Worth forty cows and two horses…”</p>

<p>“In the name of Zarathustra,” Oleg demanded
in Farsi. “Who sent you?”</p>

<p>“The Lords of the World…”</p>

<p>He fell face first, already dead. Oleg tugged
the knife out of his back (it had actually reached the heart!) and
wiped on the minstrel’s shoulder. He took some gold coins he found
in the dead man’s pocket, before starting a hard climb above.
Although his bleeding stopped, he felt too weak to defend even
against a sparrow. He’d have not been able to bury the singer in
European way if even he wanted to. Luckily, the faith of fire
worshippers prohibits the bodies to be buried in earth, burnt or
thrown into water: all the four elements are sacred and should not
be defiled by corpses. A dead body should be left open for the
predatory birds and animals to bury it in their stomachs, with the
remainders picked up by ants and bugs.</p>

<p>He fainted twice until he came back to the
shelter. The bodies of Ganim and crossbowman were all covered with
a quilt of green flies, and big yellow ants had trodden ways to
them. While the ants rushed to the bodies, their bellies were
tucked in. Those who returned had their bellies swollen, red fibers
of flesh in their tiny jaws.</p>

<p>The horses snorted, backed from the man
covered with blood. Oleg raked out the bag of gold coins, cursing
himself for having hidden it that deep, tied it across the saddle
of Ganim’s horse and mounted, with great difficulty, the
crossbowman’s one.</p>

<p>When he rode up to the gate of Gorvel’s
castle, he found guards with bare swords waiting for him. The gate
swung open hastily. Gorvel hurried to meet Oleg, helped him to
dismount. The red-bearded lord’s face was grim, his eyes flashed
like lightnings. He clenched his fists and yelled at the
guards.</p>

<p>Thomas came rushing, in full armor, only his
visor up. “Been in a fight, sir wonderer?” he cried anxiously from
the distance. “Is anyone left there?”</p>

<p>“Your minstrel with friends,” Oleg replied
gloomily, as he was combating sickness with the last of his
strength. “If you want their songs… you’ll have to go there.
They’re not likely… to climb out of the gully soon.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter
9</p>

<p>They lingered at Gorvel’s for two more days
and nights. The lord yelled, insisting on two weeks, referring to
the terrible wound of Sir Wonderer, which the joys of feast and
hunt should help to heal. However, to Gorvel’s distress, the wounds
of Pagan (whom that pilgrim no doubt was) were healing surprisingly
fast, due to Christ’s inexplicable mercy. In the second morning,
the wound was replaced by a hideous scar, which, in turn, was
subsiding before their very eyes, losing its bluish color,
whitening to match the rest of skin.</p>

<p>Gorvel glowered at the wonderer. The knight’s
world had been clear and simple before Sir Thomas, his
companion-at-arms, and this Pagan pilgrim arrived: that was a
beginning to strange things. His minstrel disappeared and turned
out to be an assassin… But he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a wonderful singer indeed!
<emphasis>Let me, Sir Gorvel, be a blockhead who knows nothing of poetry,
but Lady Roveg also enjoyed that strange man singing!</emphasis> And his
lady might have been wrong too – just a woman! – but other lordly
knights would reward him for his songs and win him from each
another! Gorvel failed to understand what could have make the
pampered minstrel leave his warm seat by fireplace and go out into
the night to hunt a stranger…</p>

<p><emphasis>And the person of pilgrim calls forth even
more questions.</emphasis> If his scars resolved that fast, his smooth
skin might have already had some more terrible wounds resolved on
it. <emphasis>Wounds of wandering and fighting.</emphasis> The one who has them
is usually no stranger to sword. And arrows… he was good with them
too, as Sir Thomas and that woman, Chachar, had told Gorvel with
delight. <emphasis>The odd pilgrim hardly could have mastered archery in
peaceful prayers, fasts or contemplations of navel!</emphasis></p>

<p>The minstrel was talked over for a while and
forgotten, but the excited rumors of five thousand gold dinars
taken by the wonderer from villains were still on. The confessor
monk, in a heat of temper, abused the Mother of God, for she had
given such wealth to a Pagan. Thomas interceded for the Holy Virgin
and all but beat the fool up. Gorvel reminded them sullenly that
villains had not been giving their gold at will and not any man
could have taken it that way. Definitely, the pilgrim <emphasis>was</emphasis>
helped by Holy Virgin. <emphasis>Perhaps he’s not a hopeless Pagan. The
Virgin is no fool, she sees a future Christian in him. He may
already be somewhat Christian, though unaware of it
himself!</emphasis></p>

<p>On the same day when Oleg came riding back to
the castle, reeling in the saddle, he asked Thomas, “Think of your
powerful enemies. Do you have any?”</p>

<p>Chachar was dressing his wounded side with
care, admiring the strength of muscle. Thomas poured wine into the
wonderer’s cup, his brow contracted. “Well… maybe Sir Gregor the
Splendid… Or rather Sir Baldan. In a joust, I threw him off. He
fell straight down to the feet of peerless Burnilda…. Down into the
mud, at full tilt…”</p>

<p>“Not your sworn enemies. <emphasis>Powerful</emphasis>
ones!”</p>

<p>“Er… I had no quarrel with kings. As far as I
remember…”</p>

<p>He knitted his brows in suffering, as he
recalled everyone whose foot he had ever stepped on or whom he had
elbowed. Oleg listened with half an ear. <emphasis>No king is obeyed in
such a blind, thoughtless way.</emphasis> That was the way Saracen
assassins obeyed their sheikhs, but the minstrel was a pure Frank.
So was Ganim, though disguised into green Saracen robe. <emphasis>Franks
are free and proud. Not the stuff to make fanatics.</emphasis> Young
Europe was not entangled in the net of secret societies yet, unlike
the ancient East wallowing in mysticism, sacraments, prophecies,
search of astral ways for mankind… and not shunning mundane poisons
and murders on the sly.</p>

<p>His blood rushed back. He heard Chachar’s
anxious voice, as though muffled by wadding. “It hurts?.. Have a
little more patience, please…”</p>

<p><emphasis>Stop lying to yourself</emphasis>, he thought
bitterly. <emphasis>It’s clear whom the minstrel meant by the Lords of the
World: The Secret Seven. Immortal sorcerers, they know no defeat
and have a clear goal. Politicians, no starry-eyed dreamers. With
their millstones, they mill whole kingdoms, empires, peoples,
nations, religions, and beliefs. Killing a hero, a king or an
emperor is the same to them as squashing a greenfly.</emphasis> “Go have a
rest,” he told Chachar. “Go, don’t growl… I need a man-to-man talk
with Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>Her beautiful eyes filled with tears at once.
The dam of eyelids could hardly keep the glittering liquid in.
Thomas looked helplessly at Oleg.</p>

<p>“Chachar!” the wonderer said through gritted
teeth and the dam broke, waterfalls of tears gushed down her pale
cheeks, but his voice was so strange that she fled as if blown out
by wind.</p>

<p>Anxious, Thomas sat down on the bed next to
Oleg. “Does it hurt badly?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, do you know that your cup is
pursued… not by ordinary burglars?”</p>

<p>Thomas thought it over, shrugged
melancholically. “No, but… what’s the difference?”</p>

<p>Oleg clenched his jaws bitterly, waiting for
a pang to pass. He sent a mental order to clean the blood – it
would prevent fester – and heated the wound up. It was painful that
way, but faster to heal. “The cup is pursued by powerful ones,” he
said in a different voice. “Now they send assassins, villains and
burglars… but some day they’ll come for it themselves. Maybe you
refuse it? And save your life?”</p>

<p>Thomas looked straight at his friend. “Thank
you. But why do you think life so dear? Honor is dearer, truth is
dearer, love is dearer. Many things are dearer than our brief
lives. Why would I stick to such a small thing? Whoever wants the
cup, they are welcome to try. I’ll be defending it.”</p>

<p>Oleg looked around, moved his head close to
Thomas. “Then I’ll tell you,” he said in a soft voice, “who wants
the cup. Maybe you tell me why they want it. Think it over once
again. Perhaps you’ll change your mind and refuse it… If you do,
Thomas, I shan’t blame you! The enemies are invincible. They are
Seven Secret Sages. In fact it is <emphasis>them</emphasis> ruling the world.
Kings, emperors, sultans, and shahs are no more than pawns on their
chessboard!”</p>

<p>Thomas looked with doubt, but his cheeks
flushed hot despite his will, his face lit up. He moved closer,
leaned to Oleg who continued in a whisper, “They are immortal. They
can be killed, but otherwise live forever. They’ve seen the birth,
prosperity, and ruin of many great ancient empires, and they
understand the secret, concealed causes of rise and failure of
peoples and kingdoms better than anyone. As they’ve lived thousands
of years, they mastered the secrets of power. Step by step, they
have learnt to influence the development of realms, to bring some
of them to prosperity and others – to ruin. You won’t believe, but
sometimes it was enough to make a scuffle on a particular day and
hour in a market – and the result was the death of ancient ruling
house, of the kingdom… and a new one, strong, young and healthy,
sprouted up in the outlying districts. The new state was usually
more just and worthy. Yes, as a rule, the Seven destroy cruel
realms and approve of kinder ones. They support nations with kind,
merciful morals and manners…”</p>

<p>“Do they worship Christ?” Thomas
interrupted.</p>

<p>Oleg faltered, his brows knitted painfully
while he thought of the answer. The knight watched his face with
strain. He could not fathom what the difficulty was. <emphasis>Those who
worship Christ are friends, the rest are infidel Pagans.</emphasis></p>

<p>“In general… they do. If to consider the
whole of it. Even before The Nativity, as you know, the world was
not in the hands of Satan. It was created and watched by God, and
His Son came to help his elderly Father. But for the Secret Seven,
Christ is not that important… Keep your temper! They saw the world
that heard nothing of Christ and they’ll see His next Coming if it
occurs… I’d rather have you bothered not with their vision of the
future world but with the danger to yourself. You can’t stand up to
such powerful men – magicians, I mean – as your enemies! And there
is something more…”</p>

<p>He sighed, his face went grey. Thomas moved
close to him. The darkness seemed to be gathering in the room. “In
ancient times, magic was powerful,” Oleg croaked. “Very little
remained of it now, but the Secret Seven come from those times!
They know many powerful secrets. I know no mortals, no kings or
heroes who could stand up to… or merely fight them!” His face
looked pinch and dolorous.</p>

<p>Thomas felt a hot tenderness for the lone
wonderer. He stretched his arm involuntarily to embrace Oleg’s
shoulders. “Sir wonderer! It’s always possible to fight.”</p>

<p>“To fight,” Oleg repeated sadly, “knowing
that you’ll die?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t Roland know it? And Beowulf who
stepped ahead to meet his death? And thousands of other valiant
heroes who died with fame? They knew life is short and fame is
eternal. Sir wonderer, if even those Secret Seven are ancient Pagan
gods, I have no fear of them. They may kill me, but they’ll never
have me giving the Holy Grail away at will…”</p>

<p>Something in the knight’s voice made Oleg ask
warily, “You don’t believe in them, do you?”</p>

<p>Thomas hesitated for a while, replied with
his eyes looking aside, “I believe in dangerous enemies. But magic…
I believe the world has it. I believe in three-headed men, flying
fish and speaking horses that live overseas… as otherwise the
life’s too boring to bear it. But, dear sir wonderer, I don’t
believe that wonders can happen to me or in places I visit.” His
eyes were honest, simple-minded.</p>

<p>Oleg sighed. “A lovely world-view! European
from withers to hooves. Step aside, old empires, make way for new
people… But I advise you to think over what I told you. The world
has no wonders, but in this only case they may… no, they
<emphasis>will</emphasis> happen if the cup is not taken by their hirelings or
thieves before.”</p>

<p>Thomas stood up. With a menacing look on his
face, he tapped the sword hilt. His gauntlet was tinkling “They are
welcome to try! Isn’t that a nail sprinkled with Christ’s blood?
Isn’t there true wood of His Cross in the handle?”</p>

<p>Oleg winced. “Stop it, Thomas. It’s
false.”</p>

<p>Thomas recoiled. “How you… How <emphasis>dare</emphasis>
you talk that?!”</p>

<p>“Do you know wood? Tell me what kind it
is.”</p>

<p>“Oak!” Thomas said with confidence. “One has
to be blind to miss it. What’s the hilt of a noble knight’s sword
to be made of if not old fumed oak, the noble among trees?”</p>

<p>“Hum… A hilt – yes, but a cross… You won’t
drive a nail into it, only get your fingers cut. Your god was
crucified on the cross of aspen! In general, your faith is
strangely hostile to this tree. Asp was the only tree that did not
bent its branches to greet your god in his escape to Egypt. And
while he was led to Calvary, only the asp did not tremble with pity
and compassion! All the other trees are said to have brought down
their branches and leaves! Surely that’s a lie. And he was flogged
by the twigs of asp. His cross, as I’ve said, was made of asp too.
Besides, it was the tree for Judas to hang himself…”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped at his words. Oleg muttered
thoughtfully, “What a stubborn tree! Trembles with fear but stands
its ground. A proud one! It began as early as the creation of the
world. Asp was the only tree to refuse doing some work then, while
all the other trees did it… In Rus’, we never hide from a storm
under an asp, for Peroun casts a lightning in it to kill a demon –
that lot always hide under asps. Once the strike of his lightning
was so powerful that the tree got spattered with the demon’s blood
all over. That was how the asp got its reddish color of leaves. And
it has one more reason for trembling: demons sleep beneath its
roots and scratch their backs on them. Asp stakes are driven into
vampires, as you know…”</p>

<p>His voice broke into whisper. He spoke to
himself, Thomas forgotten. The knight held his breath. <emphasis>How can
the wonderer know the details of Flagellation and Crucifixion?</emphasis>
The regiment prelate once told him that one of the witnesses still
walked around… <emphasis>Is it true?</emphasis></p>

<p>The night made the castle walls cold, its
gloomy halls chilly, as it is common for desert lands in summer:
hot days make you drip with sweat, you can bake an egg in the sand,
but once the night comes, your teeth start chattering with
cold.</p>

<p>Oleg found Chachar near a fireplace blazing
hot. She sat on a small bench facing the fire, throwing chocks into
it. With her face washed clean, she looked as fresh and healthy as
a sweet juicy apple. Her boots stood on the iron fireguard, her
bare feet were buried in a beast’s skin on the floor.</p>

<p>She raised her face, reddened with heat, to
look at the wonderer. Lovely tender dimples played on her cheeks.
“Dear Oleg, you must be in bed! Your wound…”</p>

<p>“…healed as a dog’s one,” Oleg dismissed.
“I’m no highborn to have them healing for ages. We’ve been here for
two days. A guest must not outstay his welcome. Is Gorvel here? Or
left for hunting?”</p>

<p>Chachar glanced around in fright and
whispered, “Have you heard? A strange rider came tonight. Sir
Gorvel locked up in his chambers to talk to him. Even Lady Roveg
wasn’t allowed.”</p>

<p>“Gorvel has much to care of,” Oleg muttered,
his heart was wrung with foreboding. “And this place is no
peaceful! Perhaps the king sent his vassals a word that Saracens
prepare an attack.”</p>

<p>“But they argued! In shouts!” Chachar glanced
around again, her whisper even more mysterious. “I was walking past
the door by chance. The visitor demanded something. Once refused,
he went yelling, threatened the lord!”</p>

<p>“Did you hear it well?”</p>

<p>“My lace got undone, so I stopped to tie it.
I leaned over and… just happened to see them through a keyhole.
Gorvel had a humble, miserable face. Would you believe it? I think
no man should be humiliated like that. Never! A man deprived of his
pride is no man anymore.”</p>

<p>“What did the visitor demand?” Oleg hurried
her up.</p>

<p>“I didn’t get it. I only saw a strange sign:
he draw a circle in the air with his hand, and then… er… maybe a
cross. And that made Gorvel blanch and bow to him. It was his
stupid wife treating him like that before! And that minstrel… I
understood all of it! Yesterday I heard Lady Roveg reproaching him
for his lack of skill to build a proper castle. I could barely help
shouting at her, ‘Do <emphasis>you</emphasis> have the skill, stupid woman?’ A
true woman demands nothing: a man will give her everything he can
at his own will. He needs to be supported, comforted, helped…”</p>

<p>“Is that man still at Gorvel’s?” Oleg asked
tensely.</p>

<p>“They say he left before dawn.” Her face was
serene. Red lights from the blazing fire played on it, being
reflected in her big gleaming eyes like a scatter of sparks. Her
cheeks were as red as if she had a good sleep all the night long.
<emphasis>Maybe she’s a sleepwalker? But that lot fails to recall their
nightly adventures…</emphasis></p>

<p>“Where’s Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>“In the great hall,” she replied in vexation.
Red sparkles in her eyes turned green. “He found some special
sword. Now busy trying it at the senior guard.”</p>

<p>At that moment Oleg grasped the meaning of
thundering, clanging, and panting sounds from below. He also heard
rude male voices, marking the best or the most violent blows with
roar and shouts. Oleg nodded to Chachar and went there, guided by
the clang of steel and the strong smell of man’s sweat.</p>

<p>When he entered the great hall, it was full
with roar and glitter of steel. The bright rays of the morning sun
struggled throw the narrow windows. In the smoky semi-darkness,
there were four men jumping and brandishing steel: Thomas fought
three Gorvel’s men. He had a triangle iron shield in hand, and the
huge sword in another moved so briskly that he seemed fenced with a
shiny wall of cold steel.</p>

<p>“Thomas!” Oleg cried insistently. “We have to
talk to the host!”</p>

<p>Thomas dodged a blow and parried two more
with a shield. “You are his guest as well!” he cried back
merrily.</p>

<p>“I need <emphasis>you</emphasis>.”</p>

<p>The soldiers grumbled. Oleg felt their
hostile looks from all sides. Someone abused (in half a voice but
loud enough for him to hear) the pigheaded prying pilgrims. “This
year is good with acorns, but they keep grunting still…”</p>

<p>Disappointed, Thomas flung his sword to a
soldier. The man caught it by hilt in the air. The rest saw Thomas
to the stairs: crying out, banging with their swords hilts on
shields. Oleg and Thomas hurried up to the second floor.</p>

<p>In front of Gorvel’s chambers, a soldier was
walking to and fro, yawning, rubbing his sleepy eyes with fists. He
livened up at their sight. “Relief?.. Oh, that’s you… Want the
master?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Thomas grumbled. “Is he in?”</p>

<p>“Lady Roveg is. And Sir Gorvel left in the
morning.”</p>

<p>A vacant smile was blown off Thomas’s face at
once. Oleg pushed the door before the soldier could stop him. The
friends rushed into the bedchamber.</p>

<p>Lady Roveg, with her eyes red and tearful,
was rummaging in a big ornate box. Two likes of it stood open on a
bench, one more – on the floor. As she heard footsteps, she
recoiled in fright, moving somewhat alike a furious cat. At the
sight of Thomas and Oleg and the guard running at their heels, she
clasped her hands and gabbled out, “A trouble, Sir Thomas! My lord
husband is gone!”</p>

<p>Thomas made a helpless gesture, glanced at
Oleg who was gloomy as night, then waved to the guard. “It’s all
right. You guard outside. Leave us!.. Lady Roveg, could he leave
for hunting? He invited me there too, I recall…”</p>

<p>“He was going to!” Lady Roveg replied, her
voice constrained with fury. “Just <emphasis>going to</emphasis>, as he had not a
single day free! So busy with building… He made no step outside the
castle gate since we came to this wild land! Even wenches… he had
enough of them in the kitchen and servant rooms.”</p>

<p>Oleg coughed, asked softly, “What’s in the
boxes?”</p>

<p>She wheeled round to him, swift as a forest
predator, her eyes narrowed wildly. “Yesterday there were family
jewels! Mine, as I was born the princess of Bodrik! I brought him,
a poor knight with a long sword, my diamonds, golden earrings,
chains with pendants of emerald, not to mention plain gold…”</p>

<p>“Any of servants?” Thomas asked, startled,
his hand feeling the sword hilt nervously.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas! Can’t you believe that a knight
can have less honor than a servant?.. No one entered the chambers
but a strange man last night. He had a long talk with my husband,
but my jewels were all in place after he left!”</p>

<p>“Did you suspect him?” Oleg asked at
once.</p>

<p>She shook her head arrogantly. “Definitely
not. He had a lord’s face. Not the sort of man to stoop to a theft.
Such men can take away but not steal… That’s just my habit to
finger my jewels before going to sleep. No occasion to wear them in
these backwoods, so I simply take and touch and shift them from
place to place…”</p>

<p>Oleg took in the room at a glance. The hook
on which Gorvel used to hang his sword was empty. “Sir Thomas, is
our bag of gold at place?”</p>

<p>Thomas got pale with indignation. “How dare
you think that? Of a noble knight!”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t he robbed his wife?”</p>

<p>Thomas shot a sharp glance at him and ran
out. His iron feet made a brisk thunder on the stone stairs. Lady
Roveg clenched her firsts in anger, her knuckles went white. “You
are,” she told Oleg suddenly, “as far as I see, a sort of Pagan
confessor to Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Not quite so…”</p>

<p>“Details don’t matter,” she dismissed, still
angry. “As a priest, you must know men better than their arms.
Please tell me: would Sir Thomas take my offer to stay as a lord of
this castle?”</p>

<p>Oleg recoiled. “But the tenure…”</p>

<p>“The King bestowed this land on a mighty
knight, not namely Gorvel! The one able to build a castle and keep
the lands under the reign of Christ’s warriors. The King doesn’t
mind names. He minds the lord to be Christian, have real power,
keep Saracen in awe!”</p>

<p>Oleg hesitated for a while, offered warily,
“He’ll be back in a moment. Better ask him.”</p>

<p>“And who is that… Chachar?” she asked
shrilly. Her beautiful eyes narrowed to slits.</p>

<p>“Hmmm… a woman. We saved her from villains.
She asked to take her to any big city.”</p>

<p>“She can stay here and work in kitchen. No,
though… If Sir Thomas stays, she will have to leave. She behaves
too bluntly.”</p>

<p>“I’ll take her away,” Oleg promised hastily.
“She likes handsome men, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“All women like such knights as Sir Thomas.
But I don’t behave that… natural, do I?”</p>

<p>They heard hurried steps behind the door.
Thomas burst in like a hurricane, blared from the doorstep, “Sir
wonderer, you’ve slandered the noblest of warriors! We, back to
back, on the wall of Jerusalem… He’s a man of great honor!”</p>

<p>Oleg was going pallid, his body numb with
cold. Thomas fell silent on half a word, his eyebrows rose in
surprise. “What else?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas… Have you told anyone of the
cup?”</p>

<p>Thomas seemed to have been windblown away at
once. A thundering fast clatter on the stairs, as if some iron
balls spilled over them, died away in a moment. Oleg did not move.
He felt miserable – and surprised of it: that was none of his
concerns. The Holy Grail was a sacred thing of Christian faith that
was hostile to him. The votaries of Christ were guilty of trampling
on his ancient Slavic faith, of destroying the priests of great
Rod, the god of all that exists…</p>

<p>Lady Roveg stiffened, her confused gaze
shifted between the pale wonderer and the open door. Her fingers
moved on the lid of the box involuntarily, following the intricate
ornament.</p>

<p>Thomas broke in like no hurricane but an
avalanche. His face was scary, with lips bluish and eyes popped
out. “It’s… gone!”</p>

<p>“Gorvel,” Oleg whispered heavily as if his
breast were heaped with stones. “What made him do it? Did
<emphasis>they</emphasis>…”</p>

<p>Thomas croaked, in more torture than the
worst sinners in the Hell suffered, “Gorvel is a man of great
honor… We stood back to back! We covered selves by a single skin,
shared the last loaf of bread…”</p>

<p>Oleg cast a wary look at the motionless lady:
her face was perplexed. He took Thomas carefully by iron shoulder.
“Gorvel would have refused the King if he commanded it, I believe.
But there are other lords whom I told you of. Their orders are
always obeyed.”</p>

<p>Thomas staggered to the table, collapsed on
the bench. His head dropped on the table with a clang of helmet.
“You speak to gods… Please help me! Tell me what to do!”</p>

<p>Lady Roveg came to him with a sympathetic
look. “Poor Sir Thomas… Perhaps the counsel of <emphasis>my</emphasis> confessor
will help you?” Behind Thomas’s back, she made a gesture to Oleg as
if throwing a cockroach out of the window. Her delicate hands lay
on Thomas’s iron shoulders, yellow lights flared up in her
eyes.</p>

<p>Oleg coughed, said in a hoarse voice, “I’ve
been fighting the Seven. And I’m alive, you see… I’m going to
saddle horses. And you, noble knight, have much to discuss with
this highborn lady.” He went out briskly, knocked the door shut
behind. The guard jumped up, grasped his sword. Oleg showed empty
hands to him, ran downstairs.</p>

<p>Chachar was still drying her boots, singing
merrily in a thin squeaky voice. The fire was blazing so hot as if
she wanted to burn the whole castle. As Oleg crossed the hall
briskly, he flung out, “Go pack your things! Now!”</p>

<p>“What? But…”</p>

<p>“Don’t be late, or we’ll leave without
you!”</p>

<p>She bit her lip but fled to her room like a
scared she-goat, with no word against. The wonderer was not like
himself, his face contorted. He seemed to have rolled up into a
tight ball, with nothing but claws, thorns, and sharp fangs looking
out.</p>

<p>In the stables, he was told by an old
stableman that Gorvel’s beloved stallion had vanished that morning.
The destrier was tendered and cared of since he had carried wounded
Gorvel out of the battle for the Tower of David. He hooved the
Saracens who tried to catch him, broke through their lines, and
took the fainted knight to the positions of European hosts. Since
then, the stallion was allotted a special stall and a special
groom. Gorvel would only ride him on the biggest occasions. Now the
stall was empty, though that beast with luxuriant mane would allow
no one close but his master!</p>

<p>Oleg led his stallion out in no hurry,
saddled him, loaded the remounts with bags. Chachar had got tired
of fidgeting on her bay mare while Oleg harnessed Thomas’s warhorse
in the same sullen way, tightened the girths, checked the saddle
hooks. He seemed to know the very moment of the knight’s breaking
away from the tenacious grip of the fair lady.</p>

<p>Chachar went as dark as a thundercloud,
scowled, her big eyes glittered with tears and fright. Once Oleg
mounted, the door of the castle flew wide open as if rammed from
inside. Thomas almost rolled down the stone stairs, as though some
ghosts were after him.</p>

<p>On the last stair, the knight lowered his
visor. He mounted heavily, galloped to the gate in silence. Oleg
trotted after him and smelled an invisible trail of woman’s perfume
after Thomas. He glanced at Chachar: she had bit her lip, the dam
of tears broken, wet glitter on her cheeks. If he smelled the
fragrance, then she, a woman to her fingertips, could discern every
tone of it…</p>

<p>The castle gate swung open, horse hooves
thundered on the planks of the bridge. The road from the castle ran
straight to the west, but Oleg reined up and pointed at hoof
prints, “He went east. As he was bound to!”</p>

<p>He turned his horse. Thomas and Chachar
followed him obediently. Thomas obviously wanted to escape the
vicinity of blubbery Chachar, so he caught up with Oleg hastily.
“Sir wonderer, you <emphasis>did</emphasis> know it!” the knight accused, with
his visor down.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“What Lady Roveg needed! You could have
helped your friend… er… escape that burden of talk.”</p>

<p>“And let her have me crucified on the gate?
I’m no highborn knight, just a pilgrim in search of my way to gods…
However, in this land knights are crucified as well. Or thrown into
stone pits.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer… I hate distressing women! We
knights were created by God to protect the weak, and women are the
weakest and most tender creatures on earth. But I… I had to offend
Lady Roveg meanly! I confessed being betrothed to Lady Krizhina,
the most beautiful woman in the world.”</p>

<p>Oleg said with sympathy, “The Saracen have
found a way: their law permits to have up to four wives. Though
<emphasis>we</emphasis> have always kept this way. A Slav could take as many
wives as he could feed and clothe. The ranks of Muslims do have a
reason to grow that robust. Mind it, sir!”</p>

<p>Chachar rode up to them, unable to do without
the company of men that long. She sounded still offended, but
fascinated as well. “Is it true that in some other country two or
more men can take a single wife? They say it’s common for friends,
brothers, companions, who don’t want to leave each other for family
burrows…”</p>

<p>They rode in gallop, the wind tousled the
manes of horses. Thomas didn’t listen to what Oleg told Chachar in
a restrained tone. “Sir wonderer,” the knight said, his throat
squeezed with emotion, “it’s no use of you trying to cheer my heart
up. It’s burnt with fire! How could noble Sir Gorvel do it? He
<emphasis>stole</emphasis>! He left everything: his castle, vast lands, beautiful
wife and faithful vassals! What would the King say of it? And other
knights?”</p>

<p>“That’s the power of <emphasis>them</emphasis>, sir Thomas.
The power that no king ever had. Yes, Gorvel contradicted, but no
long. He left all he had, went out in the night as a thief. The
secret affair always comes first.”</p>

<p>“The secret affair… The affair of Secret
Seven?”</p>

<p>“The affair of civilization.”</p>

<p>At a tilt, Thomas peered into the wonderer’s
frowning face, while Oleg’s glance snatched out the blades of grass
trampled down, pebbles pressed deep into ground, indistinct prints
of horseshoes. Chachar was all ears but silent. The horse beneath
her seemed to make an easy, sweeping float. “The Secret Seven…
struggle for civilization?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>Thomas fell silent for a long time, as he
thought it over. He snorted, peered at the hoof prints and ended
blasting out, “Damn you, sir wonderer! If they support
civilization, then you… we… What are we struggling for?”</p>

<p>“Culture,” Oleg replied.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 10</p>

<p>The thief had been in too much hurry to hide
his tracks. Oleg whipped his tired horse: he wanted to come upon
Gorvel before dark. Thomas tried to exchange a few words with
Chachar but she looked at him with eyes full of anger and
resentment. She didn’t seem to be bothered much with the fate of
civilization. Thomas came up with Oleg again and asked insistently,
“Are culture and civilization not the same?”</p>

<p>“No, they aren’t, Sir Thomas. They
aren’t!”</p>

<p>Thomas paused, rode silent for a while,
frowned. When he spoke, his eyes were full of suffering. “When we
climbed the walls of Jerusalem, shedding them with our blood… and
the blood of enemies, it was simple! And now? I’ve always thought
civilization to be at the side of good. I thought of myself as a
civilizer!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, civilization is an axe. With it,
you can cut a tree down, cut some dry twigs to make a fire… or
butcher a man. The higher civilization, the sharper axe you
have.”</p>

<p>“And culture?”</p>

<p>“Culture is the invisible fingers that seize
your arm when you brandish at a human. It is the moral law within
you.”</p>

<p>The night was falling fast, the shadows of
trees were already black as coal. Oleg drove his horse to the
thicket where, he supposed, a small spring was hiding. The trail of
Gorvel’s horse was very fresh: they would have come up with him if
not the nightfall. <emphasis>However, Gorvel will also ride nowhere at
night. Many hamster burrows here, his horse would break
legs.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas unsaddled the horses, tethered them,
tied bags of oat to their snouts. Oleg made a tiny fire, hiding it
from a stranger’s sight thoroughly behind thick shrubs, brought
some slices of bread and meat.</p>

<p>Thomas asked awkwardly, “Sir wonderer… What
about Christ? Does he support our Western civilization?”</p>

<p>Oleg dropped his eyes, feeling embarrassed by
the clear, honest eyes of the young knight. “Culture, Sir Thomas.
He supports culture! Satan is much more civilized, don’t you think
so? He knows more than Christ, can do more things. He makes wonders
at every occasion. He’s free, brave, with a broad outlook, not
bound by any rules: neither inward nor outward. A vigorous guy! As
against him, Christ looks simple-minded and not very clever. Just a
bungler! But he’s kind, eager to give his life for us, mean and
ignorant! And he <emphasis>gives</emphasis> it – for them who are no fit to hold
his candle! And then there’s a rum go: people get ashamed and start
climbing up to the light and goodness. The sacrifice of Christ was
not vain! That’s what Satan, with all his great wits, fails to
grasp. He still wonders why he, so daring and brilliant, is always
defeated!”</p>

<p>Silence fell for a long time. They supped,
horses snorted in the dark behind. Then Chachar asked, in a soft
voice, “And why is he always defeated? If he’s more daring and
clever?”</p>

<p>Oleg smirked faintly. Red lights played on
his face. “It’s not enough to be clever. And daring. It’s never
enough for man…”</p>

<p>As they went to sleep, Chachar started
settling herself between the men. For a long time she complained of
being cold, asked to warm her from both sides, her nose, palms, and
back. Thomas coughed in embarrassment. Oleg felt that the knight’s
thoughts were still far from the fire and the young woman fidgeting
between them. “Civilization is not pure evil,” he comforted. “Your
Lord, as far as I know your verities, has as much culture as he
can, and some civilization as well. So it’s possible…”</p>

<p>Early in the morning, once the dawn painted
the clouds red, Oleg woke Thomas and Chachar up mercilessly. At
night, she had managed to wriggle, like a grass snake, into the
knight’s iron embrace, but Thomas used to sleep in his armor while
in field, so in the morning she struggled herself out scratched and
bruised. Poor Thomas was so upset by the loss of the cup that he
didn’t even notice her trying to compensate it, to make him a night
of love.</p>

<p>Chilled horses were bursting into trot, or
even a gallop, but Oleg held them, as he watched the trail. They
hardly rode a mile until they found a burnt spot, its ashes still
warm. Thomas grunted in annoyance, hit his forehead with a
fist.</p>

<p>Oleg checked his bow, moved his shoulders to
adjust the quiver on his back. Thomas looked askew with his blue
eye, his iron hand began to tug the sheathed sword, tap on the
battleax. Chachar tried to ride ahead. Both men shouted and hissed
at her to stay put and keep behind. She got resentful, dropped
behind and rode there, paying no attention to the men at all. To
show her slender body once again, she would lean down from the
saddle at a tilt and snatch flowers. Thomas and Oleg rode watchful,
their eyes searching around. Over the distant shrubs, magpies were
crying, flying in circles. The men exchanged glances, adjusted
their swords.</p>

<p>In a hundred steps ahead, four mounted men on
warhorses rode out onto their road, alerted and gloomy. All of them
looked very dangerous. Two n were clad in heavy European armor,
their necks protected with the nettings of mail falling on
shoulders from beneath their helmets: a good protection against
sabers, but not Frankish swords, heavy as hammers, or Frankish
axes, massive as forges.</p>

<p>Other two men are definitely Saracens, lean
and swarthy. Their fast Arabian horses, nervous and savage, gnaw at
the bits and paw the ground, longing for a breakneck pace for which
they were born and trained. The riders are clad in gleaming light
armor of Damask steel, not common even for Arab nobles. Their bare
sabers sparkle with blue: a distinct mark of blades made of the
very best Damask steel. Their faces are haughty and still, but
their posture and shoulders speak readiness for a swift fight: so
swift that it will be all over before the heavy European knights
have time to spur their stout warhorses.</p>

<p>“Oleg,” Thomas said softly. That seemed to be
the first time he called the wonderer by name. “I think that’s a
good day start.”</p>

<p>“I don’t like my road blocked,” Oleg replied
sadly.</p>

<p>“A flimsy fence!” Thomas objected. “Just four
planks in it!”</p>

<p>“But sturdy ones.” He looked askew at
Chachar. The woman stiffened, her palms pressed to the mouth, eyes
wide open in fear and bewilderment. Just a moment ago she was
picking flowers, she had already thought up a pretext for
presenting them to the shy knight – and now these four
thunderclouds, with flashing blades of lightnings, emerged in her
blue cloudless sky! What would happen to her if her protectors
perish and their enemies survive?</p>

<p>“I’ll fight the Franks,” Thomas said
arrogantly, in a tone allowing no objection. He lowered his visor
with a clang of steel, hiding his face that became arrogant and
angry. “And you distract Saracens. Entertain them.”</p>

<p>“You’re always taking the best part,” Oleg
accused.</p>

<p>“The next time you will have it,” Thomas
promised.</p>

<p>All the four enemies sent their horses ahead.
The Saracens were motionless in their saddles, bare sabers gleaming
in hands. The armored warriors exchanged looks and smirked with
malice. One bellowed out, “Try to die at once, Angle! And you,
pilgrim, can go to your Pagan hell. Sure, we’d rather strip three
skins of you… of you alive, sure! But we’ll have all our joy on the
wench. Trembling as she looks forward to us, huh! Feels real men! I
swear she’ll have all and more of it before her soul is out!”</p>

<p>They reined up in ten steps against each
other. The Arabian horses snorted and gnawed at the iron bits,
while the heavy mounts of Franks could be mistaken for stone
statues if not the idle waving of their tails. Thomas saw the foes
meant no fast attack, so he flung the lance away and drew out his
sword in a single swift move. All the four enemies had curved
sabers waving in their hands. Oleg had an old habit of calling that
kind of weapon a Khazarian sword.</p>

<p>Confused, Oleg slapped his pockets, searched
his bosom on the left and on the right. Suddenly a happy smile lit
his face, as if he’d caught a pernicious louse. Four enemies burst
in a mocking laughter. The Saracens laughed in a restrained way,
feeling their full superiority, while the Franks swayed in their
saddles. Thomas frowned with shame for the wonderer, moved a bit
aside, as if to show he had nothing to do with him, but the
laughter of enemies only grew louder and more wicked.</p>

<p>Oleg pulled something out of his bosom. His
hand made a sudden swift move, Thomas saw a flash. Oleg flung his
hand again, turned to the angry knight. “Looks like my enemies are
done,” he said with perplexity. “Please lend one of yours.”</p>

<p>The Saracens rocked in their saddles. The man
with the knife handle in his mouth collapsed face first on the
horse neck. Another jerked his hands up, gripped the hilt of Oleg’s
knife stuck in his throat, in a finger above the mail collar. Blood
ran out in two gushes, the air hissed in his stabbed throat. The
Saracen got reeling stronger, fell down, his boot enmeshed in the
stirrup. His horse recoiled in fright, burst away, dragging the
corpse. Chachar, with her tender heart, galloped after it, feeling
pity for the animal half-mad with fear.</p>

<p>Two armored warriors watched it with
disbelieving eyes. Before they could stop laughing, there were only
two of them facing two strong, experienced, skillful fighters. Even
the pilgrim was not the simpleton he looked…</p>

<p>Thomas shared the blanked look with them.
“Fast you are… I recall you once ate a boar <emphasis>before</emphasis> we set to
dinner!”</p>

<p>“A brave heart wins two boars. May I take the
left one?”</p>

<p>“Only with return!” Thomas warned,
insulted.</p>

<p>The warriors exchanged glances, drove forward
without lesser confidence than before. The first was coming at
Thomas, the second, with a saber in right hand and a round shield
in left, rode up to Oleg slowly. He kept shifting his light shield.
<emphasis>A throwing knife will bounce off like a stone.</emphasis> Anyway. Oleg
had no more knives. He unsheathed his huge sword, spoke slowly,
“You can leave undamaged.”</p>

<p>Before the warriors could blink, Thomas
yelled angrily, “Without a fight? It’s a shame on me, a
Crusader!”</p>

<p>He galloped on the enemies, giving them no
time to recover. His huge sword glittered dangerously overhead, his
armor shone in the bright sun, scattering the dazzle of sparkles
around. He attacked the right warrior with a thunder, wheeled round
in his saddle to the left one whom he’d left to Oleg. Thomas’s
violent blow crushed the shield, which the foe barely had time to
raise, in two. His shield arm got numb, judging by his distorted
face. Thomas put his own steel shield, large as a door, under the
saber of the right enemy, turned swiftly to the left – and yelled
with fury: his other enemy had a white swan feather jutting out of
his left ear winsomely, while three palms of the arrow shaft topped
with the bloody head stuck from his right ear.</p>

<p>“You <emphasis>lent</emphasis> him!” Oleg reminded
briskly.</p>

<p>“I had a second thought!” Thomas roared. He
saw a new arrow in Oleg’s hand, squealed in a strained voice, “No!
Don’t you dare!..”</p>

<p>He clashed with the last live enemy. Both
were heavy, rode mighty horses and fought in the same manner:
stopped to take a breath, devoured each other with fierce eyes,
lurched of own mighty blows. The crushing, thundering sounds of
their duel were heard within a mile around, as if mountains were
broken by thunderclaps. The foe brandished his sharp saber much
faster than Thomas could do with his long sword, but Thomas’s armor
proved its value: the saber would only strike sparks out of it and
get indented. Cursing, Thomas slashed with his dreadful sword,
seldom cutting anything but the air.</p>

<p>Chachar approached, stopped aside. She held
the reins of the snorting Arabian horse. A different horse stood at
a small distance, moved its ears nervously as it heard terrible
clangs of metal on metal bur did not run away. Oleg dismounted,
pulled his throwing knives off, wiped them clean.</p>

<p>Chachar’s face went white. She fidgeted in
the saddle, begging Oleg with her eyes to help the valiant Thomas
who fought the nasty shaggy villain desperately.</p>

<p>“No,” Oleg replied to her mute pleading.
“There’s a great difference in… in our worldviews. A Crusader puts
the contest first of result! So he dresses the fight into rites,
dances, postures, bowing and throwing a gauntlet, while a Saracen…
or the likes of his want only to win. By all means! They are ready
to wallow in mud, play a mean trick, hit on the back or below the
belt… If civilization prevails, this way will be common. No one
will be surprised or intrude if a man down is beaten before their
eyes. Thomas has no idea that he’s fighting for culture – but he
is. He’d rather die than use ill practice! So I can’t interfere: it
will be a great insult to him.”</p>

<p>Chachar watched the dreadful fight tensely,
trembling and shivering at the violent blows and clang of steel.
“And you? Are you Saracen or European?”</p>

<p>“I’m Rusich,” Oleg replied. “That means I am
a bit of European, Saracen, Viking, Scyth, Cimmer, Arian, Nevr and
many other nations, forgotten by everyone long ago. A Rusich is a
very diverse man…”</p>

<p>They heard a terrible crash of iron torn
apart. The enemy reeled in his saddle, a broken fragment of saber
in one hand, a shield strap clenched in another. Thomas slashed
crosswise. The sliced body sank, flooding the saddle with blood.
Head and arm with a bit of shoulder fell down on one side, some
more pieces of body – on another. The horse snorted, shifted from
leg to leg but stayed in place.</p>

<p>Thomas turned to Oleg and Chachar, raised the
visor with his blooded hand, still holding the reddened sword. His
eyes searched their faces suspiciously for any hints of mockery or
irony.</p>

<p>“Why did you take that risk?” Chachar
exclaimed indignantly. “He could kill you!”</p>

<p>“That’s war,” Thomas replied with pride.</p>

<p>“But the pilgrim got rid of <emphasis>three</emphasis> at
no risk at all!”</p>

<p>Thomas eyed Oleg from head to foot with
displeasure. “He has no knightly ardor in him. No rapture of
fray!”</p>

<p>“I have none of it,” Oleg agreed.</p>

<p>They gathered weapons, cleaned them, and
loaded on the remounts: four added to their number. When Thomas
dismounted to dig the graves, Oleg kept him. “Do you know whom to
bury, whom to burn, whom to leave as they are? This mad land has
all the faiths and religions mixed up.”</p>

<p>Thomas scratched his wet forehead in a
predicament. Chachar led a horse up to him. “Please mount,” she
offered gently. “They’ll be found before vultures pilfer them.”</p>

<p>“Found by whom?”</p>

<p>“Their kin,” Oleg replied instead of Chachar,
with heavy sarcasm in his voice. Honest Thomas wanted to wonder
what kin the hirelings could have in this land, but then he saw
their faces, scolded himself silently and mounted.</p>

<p>The wonderer kept frowning as he watched the
hoof prints. In times, his fingers touched the thread of wooden
figures on a long lace. The steppe turned a hilly plain: the open
space of low grass was replaced by thick shady groves, dense thorny
shrubs, deep gullies. Twice they crossed wide streams. The animals
fled from their way in fear: hares, a herd of wild boars, a lone
kulan.</p>

<p>Oleg turned his horse often, dodged in loops,
dismounted and palmed the ground. At last, Thomas asked with
annoyance, “What’s the matter? Gorvel’s escaping! It’s time to get
upon him while he thinks us stopped by his fence!”</p>

<p>Oleg dusted his palms off, shook his head
anxiously. “We’re not the only hunters in the forest.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Someone is following by stealth.”</p>

<p>“Following Gorvel? Maybe they know he stole
family jewels!”</p>

<p>“Following Gorvel… or us.”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped, his eyes widened. “Who can be
that?”</p>

<p>“In Rus’ I’d have told you. But here… too
crowded place. Too many adventurers from all around the world.”</p>

<p>They rode about a mile in silence until
Thomas saw Oleg alert. The bow appeared in his hands, he shifted
the quiver from the saddle hook to his back, so that the feathered
ends of arrows were over his shoulder. Looking at the sullen
wonderer, Thomas unsheathed his sword, laid it down across his
saddle and rode on, ready for any unexpected thing. Chachar kept
behind them, scared, feeling a danger with her female intuition.
Her small palm clenched the hilt of a big dagger bravely.</p>

<p>Oleg reined up, said in a lifeless voice,
“They were in wait. For us.”</p>

<p>Thomas twisted his head round but failed to
get was Oleg was talking about. Chachar galloped ahead. Soon she
dashed aside abruptly with a shriek. Thomas seized the sword with
right hand, tugged the reins with the left one, rushed ahead with a
battle cry, trampling shrubs and grass down.</p>

<p>In twenty steps ahead, he saw a big black
spot of a recent fire. The grass around was yellow, ruthlessly
trampled. On the other side of the fire, three maimed bodies lay in
puddles of clotted blood, their limbs bounded tightly to the stakes
driven into the ground. In place of eyes, they had bloody hollows
where flies buzzed angrily, fought, copulated, laid their eggs
hastily. Only one had his eyes but they seemed unnaturally big.
Thomas recoiled in terror: the dead man’s eyelids had been cut away
deftly, trickles of blood clotted on his untouched cheeks.</p>

<p>He looked back at the wonderer who gave a
sullen nod to confirm Thomas’s frightful guess: the eyelids were
cut away to make the tortured man unable to close eyes, to force
him to see the terrible torments of his comrades. Skin was ripped
off their faces, greenish sinews and tight nodules bulged on the
raw red flesh. The white of teeth could be seen through the wounds
on their cheeks. The three of them had their male parts chopped off
and one had those parts in his mouth. Two men had their bellies
slashed open and filled with earth and stones, bluish guts lying on
the grass nearby.</p>

<p>Suddenly Thomas seemed to hear a moan. He
flinched, jumped up, glanced back at Oleg in fear. The wonderer
nodded again. “The last is alive. They put out his eyes and teeth,
transfixed his ears, cut sinews in his limbs… but spared his
life.”</p>

<p>“How can he live?” Thomas whispered in
superstitious awe. “How can it… that… stay alive?”</p>

<p>“Man is a great stayer, to his misfortune. Or
his good fortune.”</p>

<p>Thomas, still disbelieving, sheathed his
sword and seized a misericord from his belt. Averting his eyes in
pity and disgust, he stabbed the empty eye socket, scaring away the
flies. The body twitched, uttered a scary rattle, as a blooded
scrap of a tongue quivered in the mouth.</p>

<p>Thomas was almost weeping, pallid, his hair
on its ends. He hastened to stab the rest two with the narrow
blade. He didn’t find it in him to drive the misericord into
untouched eyes, so he stabbed the temples. Each body gave a shiver
before it was free of suffering.</p>

<p>Oleg watched him intently. His eyes, green as
fresh grass, went black as night. “Well, how’s it? Is it easier to
kill through a narrow slit of your visor? When you can’t see those
you kill?”</p>

<p>Half-oblivious, Thomas climbed into the
saddle. He sounded hoarse with suffering. “I see it, sir wonderer…
That’s why our Holy Church tries to prohibit the use of bows,
especially crossbows, at war. Two edicts proclaimed crossbow an
instrument of Devil. With a crossbow, you can kill without a single
look in enemy’s eyes!”</p>

<p>“Crossbow is a thing of progress! The Church
is right: if no way to prevent killing completely, then it should
be made difficult at least. You have to see their eyes…” He fell
silent, rose on the stirrups, cast a vigilant glance around.</p>

<p>Thomas rode silent, suppressing the wish to
look back at the maimed bodies. The wonderer cupped a hand at his
forehead, strange sparkles in his shadowed green eyes. Thomas
glanced slantwise at him, feeling his anxiety and strain. The
wonderer was a far cry from that hermit, exhausted with fasts and
self-torments, whom Thomas had once come upon and saved from mad
dogs. <emphasis>And a farther cry from the meek slave he was in the stone
pit.</emphasis> Meanwhile, little seemed to have changed about him: some
stringy flesh gained on, but still a man of few words. <emphasis>He seems
to live in two worlds at once. His replies are sometimes out of
place.</emphasis> Driven by the sense of friendship, he took the search of
the cup stolen by Gorvel in hands, though it brought him personally
nothing but trouble. <emphasis>Maybe a wonderer is a sort of knight errant
in that far land of Rus’? A man bound to help the troubled?</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg drove his horse silently to the far
green hills. Thomas glanced back at the sprawled bodies. “We should
have buried them… A requiem? I know few words in Latin… Laudetur
Jesus Christos…”</p>

<p>“Amen,” Oleg finished. “You keep forgetting
that your Christian faith has not conquered all the world yet!
Those might have been fire worshippers.”</p>

<p>They felt a stinky wind from great wings
overhead. Those were imperial eagles, a whole flight of them,
floating in their wait for people to leave. Chachar was shivering
with fright and ended riding far ahead to wait for the men
there.</p>

<p>Thomas tied up the captured horses with a
single rope, shifted the load among them once more. Scared Chachar
was peering at every move within the bushes, listening to the
sounds of live steppes. A dismal cry of jackal reached their ears
from far away. It was answered by a dreary scream, full of
depression and helpless malice, from the other end of the
valley.</p>

<p>Oleg listened, then grumbled, “Fools… Which
spearmen?”</p>

<p>“What are you talking about?” Thomas
wondered.</p>

<p>“A fool asked whether one had seen two Franks
who killed four spearmen. Another fool replied he hadn’t even seen
their tracks.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at the wonderer with badly
concealed fear. “That’s the power of sanctity… Of the cave
erudition, I mean! Once I’ve met a monk who could swear in twelve
languages, and now… er… a man who knows the tongue of jackals!”</p>

<p>“Which jackals? Those were villains calling
to each other.”</p>

<p>The wonderer looked and sounded so dull that
Thomas repeated in astonishment, “Vil… lains?”</p>

<p>“Yes, just them. Searching for us.”</p>

<p>Chachar gazed at the men with hope, so Thomas
squared his shoulders and tapped the sword hilt, proud and
arrogant. “Let them find us.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 11</p>

<p>The air grew scorching, streaming like sand.
As Thomas rode, his armor all but melted. Looking at the half-naked
wonderer, the knight stripped it off, but that brought only little
relief.</p>

<p>In the torrid heat, it were their horses who
suffered most, so Thomas recalled what he knew of the ways of local
nomads and offered, “We may ride at night! The road is even, it’s
neither forest nor mountains. If you even ride with eyes closed,
you won’t bump into a tree. The nights are bright, the moon is
full. It’s as large as half the sky! I thought the moon was same in
Britain and here but now I see it isn’t. Even stars here are
different: bigger and brighter!”</p>

<p>Oleg did not argue, and Chachar screamed with
delight. She was suffering not the heat only: dripping with sweat,
as everyone was, she would sniff herself over with revulsion, rush
ahead of men to every stream they encountered, wash her clothes at
every occasion, stuffed her belt with bunches of grass meant to
overcome, or at least absorb, the odors of steamed body.</p>

<p>Oleg smirked and said nothing.</p>

<p>In the dead of the night, he put the fire out
and woke both companions ruthlessly. “You wanted it!” They got up,
cursing the hard-hearted pilgrim, saddled, and rode out into the
chill of the night. A huge dark dome with dense placers of stars
was over their heads.</p>

<p>The big moon shone like a lantern of
oilpaper. They could see each of the smallest pebbles and grass
blades on the ground. Thomas was surprised to see they were not the
first to hit upon it: lizards darted about the night steppes,
turtles walked pompously and nibbled the grass. A column of big
black ants crossed the way. Carefully, taking the advantage of
chill, they were carrying tender pupae, as white as milk: their
children wrapped in their finest silks. The scorching sun would
definitely have burnt their unprotected bodies.</p>

<p>Thomas reined up to let them pass. Oleg
watched him with surprise, as if he saw the knight for the first
time. In his gleaming armor, Thomas looked like a giant ant, while
the ants looked like tiny knights.</p>

<p>“You’ll get tired waiting,” Oleg said softly.
“They’ll be marching to their Jerusalem all the night long.”</p>

<p>Thomas made his horse back and jump in such a
way as if the two of them were a whole. One hoof hit the ground
close to the black column but the small knights kept their
formation.</p>

<p>They rode in a slow pace to save the strength
of horses. In the ghostly moonlight, the lands around seemed even
more wild. The remnants of ancient walls, ruins of temples,
half-buried canals, thick olive groves where villains could nestle…
The country is rich but garrisoned only in castles and cities with
solid walls, while the roads are lorded by marauders and brigands:
those sprung out in countless numbers after the bloody and strange
war when mounted knights had come from the cold west, clad in their
indestructible steel, swept the light Arab hosts away, started to
raise thick-walled castles and spread the Christian faith around
with fire and sword…</p>

<p>The Franks were not for making slaves and
plundering: at least, they were not that blatant in it as all the
conquerors before. They swore having come only to rescue the Holy
Sepulcher, but once the war ended, the victorious knightly hosts
came apart. Some soldiers left for their northern homelands, others
became lucky brigands and marauders in this rich country, and all
the ancient realm became a boiling pot of noble knights, scholar
monks, highborn Saracens, assassins, astrologers, and half-savage
princelings – almost any sort of man could be found here. The
blossoming valleys were swept over by waves of nomads never seen
there before, who performed rites so cruel and repulsive that their
sight made even the toughest northern warriors blanch. As the
castles and cities were ruled by Franks, while Saracens held the
numerous villages, the conquerors rushed to raise high walls,
strengthen their gates, make grain houses and cellars big enough to
endure a sack.</p>

<p>Horses mended their pace, urged by the chill
of the night, but did not break into trot. Following Oleg’s
example, Thomas listened for a danger. He heard wolves and jackals
calling to each other. An eagle-owl flew past them silently, its
dark shadow screened the stars for a moment. Bats darted by
frequently, the flaps of their leathery wings silent the same,
their prominent eyes a frightful blaze of red coals, their sharp
white teeth shimmering like sugar.</p>

<p>The three of them descended slowly from a
gently sloping hill into a flat valley almost intact by ravines.
Thomas was the first to notice a sparkle ahead and alert. They rode
on for a long time, peering there tensely, stopping to listen,
until the sparkle turned a reddish spot, quivering and
shape-shifting.</p>

<p>They drove straight to the fire. It vanished
in times, hidden by trees. Finally, they came to a low steep stone
wall shielding a bonfire. Six sullen men were warming themselves
around it: filthy and ragged, their faces angry and irritated. Two
men leaned their backs on the stone, sharpening their curved swords
on the rough boulders. Two others lay beneath motley blankets, the
rest raked coals and spoke in hushed voices.</p>

<p>One of the men heard a clatter of hooves and
cried idly, “Tagran? You?”</p>

<p>Silently, Thomas and the wonderer rode into
the lit circle, Chachar at their heels. The six villains were up at
once. One lingered a bit and was kicked. Thomas found himself
surrounded by gleaming spearheads. Oleg dismounted unhurriedly,
Thomas followed his suit. They unsaddled and tethered their horses,
tied the bags of oat.</p>

<p>Six villains stood around, looking at each
other. One stepped back, vanished in the dark. He must have gone to
check for the crossbow bolts pointed at the gang, for strong lads
with strong bows who had surrounded.</p>

<p>Finally, a black-bearded, abruptly-moving
villain demanded, “Who are you? Why came?”</p>

<p>Chachar was scared. Thomas helped her to
dismount, while Oleg sat down by the fire, squirmed to make himself
comfortable. “Don’t you know?” he said derisively. “Who left those
three fools in ambush then?”</p>

<p>The villains exchanged glances. “Did you kill
them?” the black-bearded man asked harshly.</p>

<p>Thomas seated Chachar near the wonderer. She
cuddled up to him with her trembling shoulder, quiet as a cornered
mouse. “Definitely we would have killed them!” Thomas replied
haughtily.</p>

<p>The villains were shifting their feet. Two
sharp spearheads all but touched the wonderer’s neck, three more
were pressed on Thomas’s breast.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back. “You may sit down,” he
said with annoyance.</p>

<p>The villains exchanged glances again. The
Black Beard said in an abrupt, angry voice, “We can stand. And you
tell us quickly and bluntly: what happened to our three friends
who… dropped behind?”</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg looked at each another. The
spears pointed at them were held by strong hands but at that moment
the spearheads started quivering.</p>

<p>“They will not come ahorse,” Thomas said
solemnly, then had a second thought and added, “Never.”</p>

<p>“Neither on foot,” Oleg told them
reluctantly.</p>

<p>“And they won’t crawl on their fours,”
Chachar squealed, her voice broken with desperate braveness. “Nor
on their bellies!”</p>

<p>The Black Beard jerked his shoulder. They
heard a quiver in his malicious voice. “You couldn’t have seen
them! They skilled hunters. Grab a saiga by horns before it smells
them! They lied in good wait, you just couldn’t have…”</p>

<p>“Their wait ended before we came,” Thomas
replied proudly.</p>

<p>Oleg, in the habit of hermits and preachers
to explain and make everyone see it, spoke in a humble voice, “Are
jackals never attacked by wolves? Before we found your friends,
they had met Hazars. It’s a savage tribe, if you know: Khazars who
went wild. A hundred years ago, Prince Svyatoslav wiped the great
Khazar Kaganat off the face of earth. The few Khazars who survived
were disseminated among Pechenegs and Polovtsians. But the most
savage gang is still roaming about. They skin everyone they
capture, slash bellies open to see a man crawling around for a long
time, dragging his guts behind, with his belly stuffed with
stones…”<sup>11</sup></p>

<p>The even line of spears around them broke.
Thomas heard a heavy breath overhead, but did not look there. He
was warming his chilled palms by the fire, its dry heat make him
squint with pleasure. At last, he heard a constrained voice nearby.
“Can they… get on our tracks?” Other villains started to breath
faster at once. Thomas grasped that the speaker had articulated
what everyone was trembling about. He saw Oleg smirking at the
silly question and made a wider smirk himself. <emphasis>Villains deserve
nothing but contempt.</emphasis></p>

<p>Spears began to vanish from sight. The
wonderer tossed some twigs into the fire, paying no heed to the
villains who argued just over his head. They hissed at each other,
all but spitting, but habitual malice in their voices was replaced
by terror.</p>

<p>“But there are Frank garrisons!” a man
screamed.</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head silently. Thomas replied
competently, “Franks?.. Invincible in the battle of cavalries, but
not able to cope with light Saracen parties. They fall upon
suddenly and rob and scatter at once, then gather again at a nook.
They leave horses unshod to enable a faster gallop. And Khazars… or
Hazars… that’s the first time I hear of them but if they are wild
nomads, the heavy Frankish cavalry is no protection. I’m a knight
myself. I shall kill a hundred of them in attack but shan’t catch
up even a single one!”</p>

<p>The villains were coming to the fire one by
one. The sharp spears were now pointed at the sky. “Hazars will
take you, as they took your friends,” Oleg said in a peaceful
voice. “Alive, for sure! Ill-fated, they wreak their anger on
captives. I’d rather not recall what I saw there!”</p>

<p>They heard a moan in the dark. A different
villain held his breath as if he were punched in the gut. As Oleg
raked the coals with a twig, he felt the very air impregnated with
fear. The pale long faces with goggled eyes were pitiful and nasty
to look at.</p>

<p>The Black Beard spoke abruptly the same, but
his voice quavered. “We’ll have to ride in an arc to find refuge in
the nearest fortress. It’s just two days ride!”</p>

<p>“They’ll attack you at once. From
behind.”</p>

<p>“What if we find a shelter? We have two bows
and lots of arrows. In a cave with a narrow entrance, we can hold
for long!”</p>

<p>“…with them sitting in sight, gobbling,
drinking, and dancing for you to see. You’ll run out of your food
soon, and sooner – of your water. And see them pouring water on the
ground or each another. And when they get you, half-dead with
thirst, they won’t let you die soon. Or easy.”</p>

<p>“We’ll be sacrificed to their gods?” the
Black Beard asked in a droopy voice.</p>

<p>“Their God,” Oleg corrected. “Once they put
their gods aside for a foreign one. The only one. Khan Obadiah
adopted the new faith in the eight hundred and fifth. That was the
beginning of the collapse of Kaganat. Khazars were punished by
their old gods for apostasy and not protected by the new one. That
new god had no shape, his appearance always hidden, so he was
called hideous. Judging by his behests, that hideous god was brutal
and blood-thirsty. We, the good sir and I, don’t mind whether you
live or die. You are robbers yourself, so get paid by your own
coin. I’d never object to Hazars giving you a good Christian death,
though I’m no Christian. But we, with good sire and highborn lady…
Chachar, don’t fell, that’s a fire!.. we are against the savage
torments that await you. That’s why we’ll give you a chance to save
your bacons.”</p>

<p>“What must we do?” a villain asked in a
desperate voice. “What to do?”</p>

<p>“Saddle your horses and leave. Now. They are
just about to find this fire. And then… Old Hazars would rather
bring you to their camp, to take you with their bare hands for all
the tribe to see. They are skillful in it… But the young daredevils
can attack at once!”</p>

<p>The villains jumped up and rushed about,
snatching their strewn things, knocking each other down. Oleg was
looking thoughtfully in the dancing flames. Thomas winced with
contempt: he could forgive cowardice to unarmed farmers but not to
men who chose a risky life at will! <emphasis>Lions among sheep!</emphasis></p>

<p>While the villains saddled and tightened
girths, Thomas and Oleg took the bags of oats from their horses,
untethered them. Chachar fidgeted in the saddle, peering into the
dark, her eyes round with fright, but she kept silence, only
glanced back at Thomas and Oleg in times.</p>

<p>They numbered nine when rode out of the
valley: the knight and the pilgrim first, Chachar between them, and
scared villains behind, shuddering and bowing at every sudden sound
– a flap of wings or a crunch of brushwood.</p>

<p>Tired horses dragged along reluctantly. They
rode in silence, even Thomas and Chachar, hearing only the gentle
clatter of hooves and soft leather creaks of saddles. The moon
crept behind a translucent cloud, wandered inside the gigantic air
creature for a long time, in search of an exit – and found it under
the shaggy tail, dropped out, shone brighter, cleaning itself, but
was swallowed by a darker cloud at once. That was how they rode in
the night until Oleg pointed at the fading stars for Thomas. The
knight replied with a majestic bow of his iron head.</p>

<p>Oleg was the first to dismount, unsaddle, and
water his horse from a skin carried by a remount. Oleg’s mount,
worn out by the journey, almost drained it. Oleg took him to a
glade with rich tall grass. The villains, seeing the knight and the
pilgrim that confident, also unsaddled their horses and let them
onto the glade.</p>

<p>Once Oleg made a fire, villains collapsed on
the bare ground and fell asleep. Thomas wrinkled his nose in
disgust: he despised any creatures so fast to pass from malice to
absolute trust. <emphasis>All of them can easily be slaughtered now. Just
imagine their belief in knight’s word!</emphasis> Once they heard a
promise to help them escape Hazars, they rejoiced like
children.</p>

<p>Though villains believed them while awake,
they cried in their sleep, twitched anxiously, woke with goggled
eyes and big beads of sweat on their faces. Once they made sure of
being not captured by Hazars yet, they fell back like dead,
snorted, twitched again, gritted their teeth.</p>

<p>Oleg observed the light stripe of the skyline
closely. As the sky began to turn blue, the eastern edge of the
earth got red, as if it were shed with blood.</p>

<p>Thomas walked around the fire, his bare sword
gleaming, but then he got tired of it, sat down on a stump aside,
took the whetstone out of his saddle bag. As villains heard the
horrible swish of metal in their sleep, they flinched and groaned.
Thomas whetted the blade of his huge sword painstakingly, touched
it with his nail to check for razor-sharpness. The whetstone in his
hand screeched again, grits sprinkled over the sleeping Black
Beard’s face. The brigand writhed, cramped, howled in terror, but
he was too tired to wake up.</p>

<p>Oleg sniffed the air, kicked the Black Beard
awake mercilessly. “You are the leader? Carry the fire to that
gully. And make it as small as you can.”</p>

<p>The Black Beard went pale. “They can attack
now?” he asked in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>“A bit later.”</p>

<p>“We’ll carry it,” the Black Beard promised
hastily. His suspicious eyes followed Thomas who rose and went to
his stallion. “Where’s the knight going?”</p>

<p>“We shall ride ahead.”</p>

<p>The Black Beard pushed his gang awake. They
grabbed their arms and surrounded Oleg and Thomas hastily. “You
won’t leave without us!” the leader claimed fiercely.</p>

<p>“We pursue a man,” Oleg told them harshly.
“It’s very important for us. And you… make your camp. And don’t
hide under those trees.”</p>

<p>The Black Beard glanced back. “Can they creep
up from there?” he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Gods often throw lightnings in trees,” Oleg
explained coldly. “Especially in a plain land. A thunderstorm is
coming!”</p>

<p>The six villains shifted their gazes between
him and the clear, cloudless sky. Aside, Thomas saddled the second
horse but got thoughtful about the third one, lingered and
hesitated. <emphasis>Chachar is a woman. But does it befit a noble knight
to saddle a horse for a common men, a Pagan? Friendship shan’t mix
with rules of etiquette. Even kings never step out of
those…</emphasis></p>

<p>“You won’t leave alone,” the Black Beard
snapped. “I don’t know what that knight took from you but it
<emphasis>must</emphasis> be valuable! Or why would you three pursue him when
land invaded by Hazars? We didn’t know of those at least!”</p>

<p>Thomas pulled his gauntlets on, took the huge
sword he’d sharpened elaborately. The ground trembled of his heavy
steps. His visor was down, face hidden behind the iron grate, only
his blue eyes looked through the slit, dooming and merciless. They
could read in his cold eyes that he was about to show the
softhearted pilgrim how a man should talk to villains.</p>

<p>Oleg raised his palm, holding the knight
back, spoke gently, “It’s no treasure. The lord of the castle in
south from here stole from our knight – that’s him and that’s his
sword – a nail of Christ, their god… or prophet, other people say.
And for you, nonbelievers, it’s a plain nail. You won’t get a
single silver coin for it. Even in the countries where Christ is
worshipped you won’t, as you can’t prove it’s truly his nail, not
some fake thing. It has value only for Sir Thomas… See? The lord
insulted the good sire by stealing the nail. It’s a matter of
honor, not wealth!”</p>

<p>The villains pulled long mugs slowly. Malice
and suspect were darting in their eyes, but the pilgrim’s sad face
looked absolutely honest. The woman took a dagger, looked
defiantly. Suddenly. Oleg said, “Would you like us to give an
inviolable oath? We pursue the runaway knight for no treasure but
justice and vengeance. When we kill him, we’ll take nothing but a
bag of oat, a wineskin, and a copper cup to make a couple of good
gulps from it!”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted the sword to his left hand,
raised his right one to the sky. “I swear it on Holy Relics! I
swear it by Christ!” he thundered through the visor.</p>

<p>The villains lowered their weapons
impotently, exchanged spiteful glances. Thomas mounted heavily,
took his lance, a red banner trembling under its wide steel blade,
like a flame. Oleg gave a brigand whistle, his horse came running,
obedient, shaking the bag on his snout as he galloped, reaching for
the last mouthful of oat.</p>

<p>The Black Beard remembered he was a leader
and asked anxiously, “What must we do? We’re no Saracens but
strangers here.”</p>

<p>“Always post sentries, two of yours. Keep
your horses close. Watch them. They’ll be the first to smell the
horses of others. Should they snort, move their ears, knock with a
hoof or neigh… But if Hazars get you, it is best for you to die
fast. To take own lives. We are going to be back by night.”</p>

<p>“What if you don’t come?” the Black Beard
called after him in a shaky voice.</p>

<p>“Go north,” Oleg replied. “Hills turn
mountains there – a good hide. Hide your tracks if you can. The
mountains are your rescue: they have more caves than cheese has
holes. Look around while you go. There are caravan roads, the
famous route from Vikings to Greeks ends here. Many merchants and
caravans passing, many brigands around – your own sort – many
marauders, Ottoman riders, but beware of the Hazars most. That’s
all.”</p>

<p>In the bright blue sky, straight above the
skyline, a cloud sprung up and started to grow rapidly. Thomas
nodded at it. “That’s the storm!” he flung out with scorn. “The
rain will wash our tracks off, but sir wonderer and I… we’ll find
you.”</p>

<p>The knight’s destrier was prancing, gnawing
at the bit. While he was not to show his tiredness, the pilgrim’s
sly horse pretended to be dying. He sagged his back so that his
belly all but touched the ground, breathed with death rattles,
almost coughed. Oleg poked the stallion’s belly, he breathed out
noisily. Oleg hastened to tighten the girth. The horse looked askew
with an innocent eye. He didn’t seem to be sorry for his failure,
as if he made very little effort to do it.</p>

<p>Oleg mounted and they galloped, heading the
strengthening wind. The cloud was spreading out and concentrating.
Once as white and curly as a sheep, it went dingy grey, then
coal-black, heavy, flashing with brief evil lightnings. The heavy
menacing storm cloud moved onto them like an avalanche: thundering,
spark-emitting, crushing down the blue of the sky and getting
bigger at every moment. Its dark belly was illumed continually by
flashes of white light.</p>

<p>The road went down, between rocky walls. The
wind grew stronger and howled, squeezing through the narrow canyon.
Then the walls came apart and became lower but the path kept
winding. Oleg glanced at the dark sky, urged his horse on. <emphasis>The
rain is about to pour down and the tracks of Gorvel’s horse are
fresh.</emphasis> If they hadn’t lingered with villains, they could come
upon him at this very spot!</p>

<p>Horses trotted along a tall sheer wall when
Thomas cried in excitement, “I see fire!”</p>

<p>In three or four hundred steps ahead, a faint
smoke was rising from a slope. They could not see the fire: it was
hidden artfully behind rocks. Thomas vaulted off and craned his
neck, peering there. Oleg hold his horse in. He felt anxious but
could not detect the threat.</p>

<p>Thomas threw the rope hastily round the
stallion’s forelegs. “You go with me?” he called to Oleg.</p>

<p>Oleg dismounted slowly, shifted the bow from
the saddle to his shoulder. Thomas adjusted his sword baldric and
started up the steep slope. In his gleaming armor, he looked like a
metal statue. Stones cracked under his iron body, burst, crumbled.
Oleg barely had time to dodge boulders falling from under the
knight’s feet.</p>

<p>They could see the fire burning out, its
burnt crimson coals, when there was a thunder of stones above. Oleg
grasped it at once, bellowed for Thomas to look out and jumped
away, under the shelter of a stone ledge.</p>

<p>A colossal boulder was rolling down. On the
go, it bounced and kicked down two more huge stones. The three of
them brought down a whole rockslide.</p>

<p>Crawling on his fours, Thomas tossed his
head, glanced at Oleg, then looked up again, advanced his hands
involuntarily. The rockslide was coming down at him. Stones
bounced, fell down with force, knocking down another mossy
boulders.</p>

<p>Cursing, Thomas dashed aside. Oleg felt a hit
on shoulder, curled up under the ledge. Rocks crashed overhead,
bouncing down from it. The dust rose. Big boulders flew above and
by but pebbles, grits, clods of earth, and broken stone fragments
rained down his back and head.</p>

<p>When the thundering sounds descended, Oleg
straightened up, throwing a layer of earth and pebbles off his
back. The rockslide had rushed by, the stones scattered within
scores of steps at the mountain foot. Horses had run aside,
terrified by the crash.</p>

<p>The earth was bare where the rockslide had
passed. Thomas was seen nowhere. Cold with fear, Oleg dragged his
feet down the slope. His right arm hung loose, numb of the strike
by stone. The ground was sagging beneath his feet, bare and
friable.</p>

<p>After he made two score steps down, he saw a
scatter of stones, a flash of metal beneath them. He hurried down
there, flung some rocks aside. A crumpled, filthy iron shoulder
turned out to be hidden beneath. The cleft was filled with stones
and the knight had been thrown there too, the mass of rocks rolled
over and trampled his metal body deeper into the crack.</p>

<p>Oleg hurled the boulders away, his back
prickling, right arm still aching and unable to move. He released
the knight’s helmet, then turned Thomas on his back, tugged his
visor but the crumpled grate stalled. Scraping his fingers and
making an awful grind, Oleg raised the visor – and recoiled. The
knight’s face was pallid, its right side covered with red blood,
his lips foaming with bloody saliva. “Sir Thomas,” Oleg called
insistently. “Sir Thomas!”</p>

<p>Thomas’s eyelids were closed tightly, the
eyeballs beneath them motionless as if made of wax. Oleg rolled
away the last rocks angrily. The knight’s armor, once gleaming, was
dark and dented. However hard Oleg tried to pull Thomas out of the
iron shell, he failed to do it with his one hand: no clasp wished
to be undone. He felt the first shiver down his right arm, the
fingers on it started to move again.</p>

<p>He undid the flack, splashed the water from
it on the knight’s pallid face. Thomas’s eyelids fluttered, rose
slowly. He stared into the space, his smashed lips moved. Oleg
heard a rattle. “Sir wonderer… Are we still in this world?”</p>

<p>“It’s the only world where we can be
together. Can you get up?”</p>

<p>Thomas strained but his body remained as
motionless as the cleft he lay in. “My road ends here,” he
whispered in a dull voice.</p>

<p>Oleg heard a rustle above followed by heavy
hasty steps. It was Gorvel hurrying down to them, hopping on
stones. He was clad in armor: not full armor, as the one Thomas had
on, but a light mail riveted with steel plates on most vulnerable
places. The mail reached his knees. He wore light boots and a
gleaming Saracen helmet topped with a feather, a green cloth winded
in rows around its base. Gorvel had a curved dagger on his belt and
a curved heavy sword, a strange mixture of a knightly sword and a
saber, in hand. “You’ve had a long run after me!” he cried. “But
I’m no deer to flee a hunter! And even a deer can hit with antlers,
can’t he?”</p>

<p>Oleg stood up, his fingers seized the knife
handle. <emphasis>No time to shoot. Gorvel in three steps.</emphasis></p>

<p>The red-bearded knight smirked at him. “Why
in left hand?”</p>

<p>“I’m a left-hander,” Oleg replied. Gorvel
looked him over and smirked maliciously.</p>

<p>“…with a scabbard on your right? You are
<emphasis>both</emphasis>-hander, a fool can see it. But now you have one hand
and a knife whilst I have two and a sword. See it? You can return
to your horses. Ride away and never look back.”</p>

<p>Oleg bent down a little, the knife pointed at
himself, in Scythian way. His grass-green eyes were fixed on
Gorvel’s sullen, angry face. “I’ll stay with him.”</p>

<p>Gorvel muttered a curse, made a small step
ahead, his sword started whirling in semicircles. Oleg recoiled
swiftly to the right, then moved left, checking his bruised
body.</p>

<p>Gorvel’s eyes widened. He stopped and
grumbled, “I hate knives… Hey, pilgrim! You are a very dark horse.
Why do you care of this knight? I have scores to settle with
him.”</p>

<p>“I rode with him.”</p>

<p>“And I was at war with him!”</p>

<p>Thomas moved his lips. Oleg heard a faint
whisper. “Sir wonderer… Leave. It’s my fault, my mistake!..
Leave…”</p>

<p>“We’ll win more wars,” Oleg comforted Thomas,
keeping his eyes on Gorvel. “The Gate of Heaven is still closed to
us!”</p>

<p>“Leave… Then… if you like… come back and
kill… Holy vengeance…”</p>

<p>Gorvel heard him and nodded. “Quite so! Come
back later and…”</p>

<p>“I’d rather kill you now,” Oleg objected. He
prepared to throw a knife, swinging on his half-bent knees, looking
for Gorvel’s vulnerable places.</p>

<p>The red-bearded knight glanced back angrily.
His face was unhappy, as if he were bound to do what he hated. “I
hate knives… Especially throwing ones. But I’m not afraid of
them!”</p>

<p>He stepped forward, raising his sword. His
eyes met Oleg’s. Two steps remained between them. Gorvel bared his
teeth, went pale, as he drove himself into rage. His forehead
bulged with sinews, his sword became a part of his glittering steel
body.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 12</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a clatter of hooves
below. Five riders galloped, raising dust, to the foot of the hill,
surrounded the horses of Oleg and Thomas. Two of them dismounted at
once, untethered horses, grabbed the reins. Gorvel saw it over
Oleg’s head, bellowed in fury, “Blizzard! They stole my
Blizzard!”</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back, rocked aside at once, in
case of Gorvel taking the chance to hit. At a glance, Oleg saw
among the riders a horse with ornate harnesses, empty saddle and a
big swollen bag behind it. Gorvel watched the strangers in fury,
making no attempt to attack Oleg. The burglars rode slim
short-legged horses, so the stallions of Franks stood out by their
might and height.</p>

<p>“The cup in your bag?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>“I’m not the one to carry it on my back!”
Gorvel snapped.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas was.”</p>

<p>“Did it help him?”</p>

<p>“You’d better not leave it in the bag!”</p>

<p>“There’s no use crying over spilt milk.”</p>

<p>The strangers who had taken their horses
started to remove and untie saddle bags. Two of the men laughed, as
they pointed at the furious knight on the mountain. Gorvel cursed,
started coming to Oleg, looking past him. Oleg stepped aside.
Gorvel ran down faster, shouting threats. The sword in his hand
scattered orange lights.</p>

<p>Oleg bent over Thomas, put his palm on the
knight’s pale sweaty forehead. “Take heart, Sir Thomas. Your life
is in your hands.”</p>

<p>“In the hands of Holy Virgin,” Thomas
reproached in whisper.</p>

<p>“In yours,” Oleg objected angrily. “Don’t you
see? Sir God refused to take your knightly soul that soon. You
haven’t delivered the Holy Grail, so don’t show white feather.
Heading for the paradise, I mean. Get up. It’s not the time for
eternal rest yet.”</p>

<p>Thomas stirred with a groan. To his own great
surprise, he managed to sit up, though contorted with acute pain.
“The mountain chewed me up and spat out…”</p>

<p>“Yeah, but it came to grief over your armor!
The first time I see the use of it.” Thomas made a faint but proud
smile. Oleg decided not to say that, despite the heavy armor had
saved the knight’s life, without it he would have dodged on
time.</p>

<p>They heard a shout of fury, clang of steel
below. At the foot of the hill, Gorvel backed, beating off two
marauders. The third one lay in a puddle of blood. Gorvel lunged,
the second marauder fell down with his head slashed in two, but the
next moment they heard a clatter of hooves, as several more riders,
apparently marauders from the same gang, rushed out from the other
side of the hill, screamed, unsheathed their sabers, and galloped
on Gorvel.</p>

<p>Gorvel wheeled round, ran up the slope. Three
marauders dismounted and rushed after him, falling on the steep,
clinging at the rocks. Despite his armor. Gorvel was a fast
climber. Only once had the fastest of burglars come upon him, but
Gorvel heard his rattling breath, dropped at once, his sword
swished low above the ground. The marauder uttered a dreadful
scream: the curved blade slashed his knees.</p>

<p>Panting, clutching at stones and grass,
Gorvel climbed up, straight to where Thomas was sitting. Oleg
raised his knife and, once Gorvel was in three steps, flung it.
Gorvel had no time to dodge, his eyes widened in mortal fear – but
the knife swished by, almost having cut his ear off. Gorvel heard a
hoarse cry behind, wheeled round, raising his sword, but the
marauder who had come upon him was sinking down, his teeth bared in
a silent cry, the knife hilt in his throat. Gorvel cast a sullen
look at the wonderer, hesitated for a moment, tugged the knife out
and hurled back to Oleg. “Thank you. I didn’t expect.”</p>

<p>Oleg caught the knife in the air, shoved into
the cover. “We’re in the same boat so far,” he said.</p>

<p>Thomas winced, as if he had a pang. “I’ve
always revered pilgrims for their wisdom!” Gorvel said hastily. He
turned his back to Oleg as a sign of trust. Oleg drew his bow
quickly, took an arrow with fingertips. The marauders were slow
climbers, stumbling and falling. Oleg allowed them three score
steps before he shot four men. The rest collapsed on the rocks,
cursing.</p>

<p>“Excellent shots!” Gorvel admired. “I’ve
always advocated equipping out army with bows. The civilization is
to replace the dated rules of morality.”</p>

<p>“A dishonorable weapon!” Thomas objected. He
waited for a pang to pass and forced out, “A coward can kill a
brave man, a weak one can kill a strong one. The culture is
against…”</p>

<p>Gorvel smirked but said nothing, as he
glowered at the knight. Thomas started getting up. Oleg handed the
sword to him. The knight leaned on its cruciform handle, rose to
his feet, reeling. One of the villains looked out, intending to run
into another shelter. Oleg’s bow string clicked at once. The white
feather bloomed on the marauder’s chest on the left, he waved his
hands, fell on his back, rolled down.</p>

<p>Gorvel clicked his tongue. “Splendid! The
main thing is to damage the enemy. Honest or dishonest… that will
be forgotten. Winner is always right. There are no foul ways while
at war. All is good that brings victory. It’s the law of
civilization!”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, straightened up with great
effort but Oleg stopped him with his palm raised. “Civilization
against culture – that’s a long battle. Our great-grandchildren
will see the end of it. And we have simpler matters to settle. How
much water we have?”</p>

<p>“Two water skins of mine,” Gorvel said. “On
my horse.”</p>

<p>Thomas curled his lip. “A pie in the sky is
closer!”</p>

<p>They heard a cry from behind the rocks where
the marauders were hiding from arrows, saw one of the villains
waving a white kerchief. Oleg raised his hand to show he had no
weapon in it, and the man shouted, “Hey you, noble knights! We know
your habit to carry gold and jewels in your belts. Leave your arms,
armor, and clothes – and you can go away. We are not Hazars. We
don’t need your lives. Only your gold.”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing, his loathing look all
but burning holes in Gorvel’s armor. Gorvel stirred nervously,
shooting glances at Thomas, the wonderer, and marauders. “How can
we see,” Oleg cried loudly, “that it sufficed?”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer, how can you?!” Thomas
whispered indignantly.</p>

<p>“A stratagem, you fool!” Gorvel interrupted
bluntly. “Go on, sir… what’s your name. Keep haggling!”</p>

<p>“You won’t stand up to our attack!” the
marauder shouted. “There are twelve of us… eleven. All former
soldiers of Crusade!”</p>

<p>“Twelve or eleven?” Oleg cried back.</p>

<p>“Eleven,” the marauder snapped. “We’re no
lousy footpads took knives for the first time and went onto road!
We fought way across Cilicia and Palestine. We took Saracen cities
by storm!”</p>

<p>“We need to have a counsel,” Oleg replied.
The marauder subsided behind the rocks. Oleg turned to Thomas and
Gorvel. “What will we do?”</p>

<p>“Attack them,” Thomas said with dignity, in a
husky manly voice. “Throw them down to the foot and shake their
souls out!”</p>

<p>“A fitting answer!” Oleg said with
admiration. “Noble and brilliant! Knighthood in all its beauty. Now
I’d like to hear something different. Sir Gorvel?”</p>

<p>Gorvel combed his fire-red beard with his
five thoughtfully, glanced back at the scatter of stones, the
helmets of marauders shimmering behind it. “Only two good passages
lead into this cleft. I can defend any of them against any host:
they can only come by one or two. And you close another
passage.”</p>

<p>“Less spectacular but more practical,” Oleg
agreed. “But it’s noon, and all they need is to wait for the night
come. They know where we are. In the dark, they will climb higher
and shower us with darts and stones.”</p>

<p>They drank the remnants of water from Oleg’s
flack. Gorvel refused proudly, though he suffered not lesser thirst
than Thomas. Oleg did not insist, poured the last drops into the
pale knight’s mouth. Thomas tried to take the upper part of his
armor off. Oleg helped him with it, whistled at the sight of solid
bruises. Thomas moaned when Oleg’s huge hands started to set his
joints right, to knead his body, making the blood flow in it again.
Big beads of sweat ran down the poor Angle’s face, his eyes rolled
up creepily.</p>

<p>At last Oleg let him off. Pale as death,
Thomas rose up to his feet, crouched to try his muscle. “Sir
wonderer,” he said in a constrained voice, “you are the best healer
that ever came into this world! My bones are burnt, as if I were in
Hell that awaits for mean Sir Gorvel, but my sinful body obeys! My
hand keeps the sword.”</p>

<p>Gorvel was sitting aside, scowling from under
his bushy eyebrows. His eyes flashed with a strange expression,
which Oleg would call a compassion. “Timely. You’ll need it soon,”
Gorvel told Thomas in a flat voice.</p>

<p>“We’ll grind the marauders into dust,” Thomas
promised. “And then I’ll kill you, a foul thief who disgraced the
knighthood!” Gorvel gave him an ironical bow but kept his sword in
hand.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking, the marauders peeped out
from behind the rocks. Two of them sharpened their swords
demonstratively, talking to each other. Only one villain remained
at the foot, not to mention two wounded men. The rest were climbing
up unhurriedly to attack in the dark.</p>

<p>Thomas snuffled angrily, piercing Gorvel with
fiery looks. His fingers went white, as he gripped the sword hilt.
Gorvel alerted, tucked his legs under him, ready to jump up at any
time.</p>

<p>Oleg raised his hand and spoke slowly,
“Perhaps we’ll all die soon. A good moment for truth, isn’t it? Sir
Gorvel, you have startled everyone, I would say. The king made a
gift to you: vast lands in your use forever, lots of villages and
hamlets with their small folk. Your castle, faithful vassals, your
beautiful wife who was about to bring your heir… Your abandoned all
of it suddenly! And became an outlaw. You ran away from your own
castle. Why? What for?” Gorvel replied with a gloomy smirk, silent
and mysterious. “What rank?” Oleg asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Gorvel shot a glance at him and said nothing.
Oleg drew a figure of eight upside down in the air. Gorvel’s eyes
widened. Oleg drew another sign, his eyes fixed on Gorvel’s face.
The knight twitched, hardened his sword grip. Oleg drew a line and
encircled it. Gorvel went pale and jumped up. “That… That’s
impossible!”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted his startled gaze from the
red-bearded knight to the wonderer.</p>

<p>Oleg smiled malevolently. “Oh, I see. You are
just an apprentice… But for the Holy Grail, they would have raised
you to a master? Hum. They could move you straight into…” He
stopped in the middle of a sentence, drew a complicated symbol.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Gorvel asked in a stunned
whisper. “How do you know our secret signs?”</p>

<p>Oleg drew a new symbol. “And this?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>Gorvel’s voice gave a quaver. “A symbol of
upper ranks. I’m not allowed… Are you a Grand Master?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head slowly. “I could have
deceived you. As I know the rites and secret symbols, I could make
you obey blindly… Sir Thomas, this man is a member of the secret
society that has more power than any king or emperor. It has the
most loyal servants: the ones who serve not their king or seignior,
not any man but Idea!”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“The idea of progress. The idea of
civilization.”</p>

<p>Gorvel scowled. His face expressed distrust,
doubt, even fear, as if he were thinking the wonderer to play some
game, about to reveal himself and give a sign that would make him,
Sir Gorvel, obey implicitly. And he <emphasis>will</emphasis> obey, as he obeyed
the night rider who showed a secret symbol and ordered to leave all
the wealth acquired by hard work, to steal the cup and carry it, as
fast as he can, to the indicated place. “Is it a wrong idea?”
Gorvel asked in a feeling voice.</p>

<p>“Once Diogenes was asked: why did he praise
the verse of a bad poet for all to hear. And the philosopher
answered: for he was writing verse instead of robbing! In our
world, every idea is better than robbery. Any idea implies order,
hierarchy of values, obedience to no men but law. When an Eastern
despot conquers dozens of neighbor kingdoms with sword and fire and
unites them into a large empire, it is the lesser evil, ‘cause it
puts an end to bloody wars between those kingdoms and roads are
cleaned from villains and merchants are free to carry their goods
and caravan ways turn safe and peaceful villagers are spared of
sudden forays… But despotism <emphasis>is</emphasis> evil. The barbarian kingdoms
of Europe, with all their roughness, give people more freedom, give
feelings of pride and dignity. A better thing, as I’ve said, is to
serve no king, even the noblest one, but a noble Idea… But, Sir
Thomas, you have seen that the idea of civilization is only good
against extreme savagery!”</p>

<p>Gorvel watched him warily and silently. At
last, he asked uncertainly, “What is above civilization?”</p>

<p>“Culture,” Oleg replied – and realized he’d
lost the battle for Gorvel’s soul. The face of red-bearded knight
changed at once: his watchfulness replaced by a deep and blunt
contempt. His shoulders relaxed, he glanced back to where the
marauders were gathering behind a stone ridge, ready for the final
attack.</p>

<p>Thomas, who was watching the wonderer with
confusion, alerted at once, jumped up and moaned: he’d forgotten of
his body beaten by rocks. Below, in the dusky valley, some riders
were galloping from far away. Their horses rushed in wild fear,
dripping with lather, the riders clung to their manes with no look
back. In half a mile behind them, there was a vague mass
approaching. In the dusk, it took Oleg some time to discern lots of
galloping horses, their riders half-naked and beastlike, with
flying black hair.</p>

<p>Gorvel and Thomas peered there anxiously, as
they heard a menacing clatter of many unshod hooves. Marauders
turned to the valley. Thomas found his voice at last. “Sir
wonderer… Those are Khazars? Or Hazars, I mean?”</p>

<p>Not bothering to reply, Oleg unsheathed his
sword and raised overhead. The blade glared in the setting sun,
poured bright lights into the dark valley. Gorvel scowled at the
sword in pilgrim’s hand, with astonishment and anxiety for the
weapon’s size and the easiness with which the strange companion of
Sir Thomas wielded it.</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill, the riders rushed at
full tilt by the marauder guarding horses. He span round in
confusion, holding the frightened horses. At last he grasped to
mount, but barely had time to take reins when the screaming horde
was upon him, a glitter of many narrow sabers. Several Hazars
galloped on after the runaways, catching up with them: the horses
of Hazars looked much lighter.</p>

<p>Oleg whirled his sword once more in the red
light of sunset. Suddenly, the first of runaways vaulted off his
horse, fell, rolled over his head, got up and started climbing the
slope. Two others followed him: abandoned their horses, ran up on
their fours, their arms and legs moving briskly.</p>

<p>In three score steps from the cleft with two
knights and the pilgrim, the marauders span round in confusion,
like loaches on a hot pan. The three runaways were pursued by
dismounted half-naked barbarians. The marauders were on their way.
Two of them made up their mind at once, leapt out of the shelter.
Before Oleg dropped his sword and snatched the bow, they had dashed
aside and vanished among stones, with only a clatter of pebbles
beneath heavy boots. A thickset bare-breasted marauder in a
feathered helmet turned to the cleft and cried, “Hey! Those devils
took our horses!”</p>

<p>“Grudge?” Oleg said with surprise. “You
<emphasis>stole</emphasis> them!”</p>

<p>“Took as loot,” the marauder objected. He
gave a once-over to Franks, then to Hazars whose bodies glistened
with sweat. There were two scores of them pursuing the runaways,
the rest galloped at the foot, whooping and whistling. “Any ideas?”
the marauder cried.</p>

<p>“Why do we need ideas?” Oleg replied
arrogantly before Gorvel or Thomas could say a word. “You got
between the hammer and the anvil. We’ll stay above and watch you
skinned, your guts dragged out, your bones broken… You’ll have a
very slow death: Hazars are skillful in it. And they love it.”</p>

<p>The marauder twitched his mouth in a smile.
“Should we be upset for you seeing the details badly? They’ll do
the same to you, won’t they?”</p>

<p>“I’m persuaded,” Oleg flung out carelessly.
“Drag your gang here!” The marauder gave out a short cry. His men
jumped up and followed their leader up the slope, hurried by the
terrible beastly howling of Hazars coming from behind.</p>

<p>Thomas gasped with indignation, his face
turned red, eyes popped out. “Sir wonderer! How dare you!.. I can
tolerate you accepting this rat – he was a brave knight long ago.
But these… they…”</p>

<p>Gorvel gave a predatory smirk. “…once were
soldiers of our glorious hosts,” he jeered. “That’s all right.
Look! There are some worse men running! And I swear on Holy Grail
that your strange pilgrim would accept them too!”</p>

<p>The Black Beard and two of his gang were
climbing behind the marauders, almost up with them. The villains
had exhausted faces stained with mud, the last one had his hair
matted and stuck up, like a comb, with dry blood. However, the
three of them retained their sabers and daggers, bows and full
quivers looking out from behind their shoulders.</p>

<p>Thomas was seething, his voice lost to fury.
Gorvel looked ready for anything, his back pressed on the steep,
the gleaming sword in hand – but his eyes were fixed on the
pilgrim, his whole manner showed he was just an armored warrior
while all the leadership and responsibility was upon this… very
holy pilgrim.</p>

<p>The marauders were the first to run to the
shelter. Oleg nodded towards the left end of the cleft. They obeyed
at once, as former soldiers, stood there with bare swords and
closed shields.</p>

<p>The villains came running, rattling,
frequently collapsing on the ground. “You didn’t come,” the Black
Beard cried hoarsely. “We decided to follow…”</p>

<p>“Guard the right end,” Oleg ordered. The
Black Beard nodded, his breast heaving. The three of them put
arrows on bow strings, turned to the hill foot. Hazars were running
up fast, bent forward like spiders, moving their limbs briskly,
stones poured down from under their feet.</p>

<p>“They have no bows,” Oleg said. “Let them as
close as possible!” He could have shot any Hazar by that time, but
the villains would also start shooting their cheap bows of village
hunters then. <emphasis>Unfeathered, unsighting arrows. It will be good
for them to hit in twenty steps.</emphasis> “Shoot after I do,” he warned
severely.</p>

<p>He waited for a while, shot an arrow into the
breast of a big Hazar, almost the last of climbers, fingertips took
another arrow at once, it went straight into another foe’s eye,
then he shot the third Hazar, the fourth, always selecting the
farthest ones, as the closer would be reached by villains.</p>

<p>Below, there were ferocious cries, screams,
shrieks, clang of steel. Five out of the twenty Hazars had run up
to the crevice. The marauders jumped out to meet them with flashes
of curved swords. A cut-off forearm fell to Oleg’s feet. Hazars
screamed in high-pitched voices, marauders swore. Thomas and Gorvel
rushed to help them but came at the moment when the last Hazar
collapsed, splashing his blood around, on the dead bodies of
congeners.</p>

<p>The marauder with naked breast bared his
teeth in fierce smirk. “See the worth of soldier guard, konung?” he
cried to Oleg. “My name’s Roland.”</p>

<p>One marauder was wounded, the rest splattered
with blood of others. Oleg climbed on a stone ledge. Below, at its
very foot, a huge half-naked barbarian was fidgeting on his horse.
His face was painted with colored clay, a saber glittered in
hand.</p>

<p>“Make a fire,” Oleg said softly, without
looking back. “Cut green twigs off the bushes behind you.”</p>

<p>Gorvel raised his eyebrows in fascination.
“Some magic?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Oleg told him. “The most powerful one!
They want to speak to us.”</p>

<p>The villains ran to the bushes eagerly, cut
both just over their roots, while marauders made a fire deftly for
all to see. When blue-grey clouds of smoke began to rise, with
different intervals, above Hazar camp, Oleg covered the fire with
branches, removed them, put down again for a while and flung away:
the green leaves had rolled up in tubes, the thick smoke about to
turn fire. He stood up, fingered the hilts of throwing knives.
“I’ll go and see what they want.”</p>

<p>“Go to these devils?” Thomas cried in
awe.</p>

<p>Gorvel watched him with disapproval.
Marauders and villains, bunched in two close groups, argued with
heat, cast suspicious glances at the pilgrim. The marauder who
called himself Roland said loudly, “Are you going to sell us to
those beasts?”</p>

<p>Oleg did not reply. “Keep your sword bare,”
he told Thomas. “We’ll meet at the middle, and you… you and Gorvel
show you are ready to come to my aid. You’ll have a shorter run
down than Hazars – up the slope to their chieftain.”</p>

<p>“Do you expect an ambush?” Thomas asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“Just in case. It will come right if they see
us at call.”</p>

<p>At the foot of the hill, Hazars were roasting
meat, turning a huge spit with a whole saiga. Horses had been taken
away. A tall barbarian was climbing up the slope. His body was
covered from head to feet with drawings in colored clay. A pair of
short leather pants made all his clothing. His thick wrists gleamed
with massive bracelets, and armlets of the same metal embraced his
arms just above elbows.</p>

<p>Oleg looked at him closer, slowed down his
pace. The barbarian glanced above once or twice. As he saw his ruse
discovered, he went up faster, in quick steps.</p>

<p>Oleg shuddered as he watched the leader of
Hazars coming. To the waist he was naked but looked as though clad
in bony armor composed of many fragments, with their edges covering
each other. Joints were marked by swollen scars that had turned
bone or even stone. On his belt of coupled iron plates, he had a
huge Arabian sword and, on another side, an axe with curved
blade.</p>

<p>The Hazar was heavier and more massive than
Oleg. His legs resembled thick logs, he was all covered by a dark
bark of his “bone armor.” <emphasis>No sword will slash through it, no
iron arrow hit.</emphasis> Oleg remembered him as a fierce and fearless
warrior, but as the years passed, his friends died, only few lived
to be old and killed, in Khazarian way, by own grandchildren for
being useless – this one was still riding fiery horses, making
forays and bringing captives. In the best years of Khazar Kaganat,
he became a warrior hero, scary in his might.</p>

<p>But ages passed since that. The Kaganat was
shattered with a sudden blow of furious Svyatoslav. The few Khazar
survivors scattered, dissolved among neighbor nations. Only this
invulnerable warrior, whom the last generations called Karganlyk,
gathered a hundred of the same implacable fighters as himself and
continued foraying. Not on Rus’, where a sure death awaited, but on
Pechenegs and Kumans. He robbed them, going farther and farther to
the south.</p>

<p>Oleg looked in Karganlyk’s face, as
motionless as a tortoise shell, with pity.</p>

<p>Karganlyk’s stone jaws came apart slowly.
“You again, my Old Enemy?” he roared.</p>

<p>“I haven’t met you for ages, Karganlyk,” Oleg
said instead of greeting, as he wished neither good day nor good
night to such an enemy.</p>

<p>“Why did the Old Sorcerer come again to the
land of Khazar?” Karganlyk asked him,</p>

<p>“The dog had a house,” Oleg replied gloomily.
“Until the rain burnt it. Where do you see the land of Khazar?”</p>

<p>Karganlyk stamped his foot angrily. “This is
our land!”</p>

<p>“The dog had a house,” Oleg said again. “The
northern lands of the Khazar Kaganat were taken by the princes of
North, the eastern lands – by Kumans and Pechenegs, and southern…
But you came not to discuss old times, did you? I have much to
recall with pleasure, but why should you re-open the old
wound?”</p>

<p>Karganlyk glowered at him. The Hazar’s heart
pounded, raising a hot wave. He had already been a field chieftain
when he met that sorcerer. A sorcerer and hermit whose cave had
been ruined, so he walked across Khazarian steppes to the south to
become, as he explained, an anchoret in deserts. That was the time
Obadia had just adopted the true faith and burnt the old tribal
gods, declaring them to be idols. He ordered to capture the hermit
and sacrifice him to the new god to mark his triumph. However, on
the way to the nomad camp the sorcerer managed to free himself,
slaughter the five strongest warriors, and steal the best horses.
The numerous pursuers were killed by his arrows or drowned in a
bog. Only on the fifth day did Karganlyk, with ten young
daredevils, come upon him! And Karganlyk was the only one to
survive, though his two arrow wounds still kept ached at bad
weather.</p>

<p>“Leave others to me,” he said harshly. “And
you may go. We are enemies but, strangely, I feel no hostility. You
witnessed the grandeur of Khazar Kaganat, its glory! That’s why I
don’t want to kill you.”</p>

<p>“Well,” Oleg agreed. He watched Karganlyk’s
motionless face closely. “I leave them all. May I choose the horse
and things for myself?”</p>

<p>Karganlyk nodded, his eyes were full of great
astonishment, then he checked himself and added, “Not everything.
You can take all the horses and things… save one small cup.”</p>

<p>“It’s no gold,” Oleg spoke slowly, his eyes
fixed on Karganlyk’s face. “Neither silver… Why do you want
it?”</p>

<p>Karganlyk moved his enormous shoulders
heavily. “And you?”</p>

<p>“It’s important for my friend. A sacred thing
of his faith. But your faith is different.”</p>

<p>“I strengthen it by throwing down the gods of
others!” Karganlyk said sharply.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard much of that… When you defile the
shrines of others, you throw mud into the face of your god. You
flung down the gods of Slavs, Normans, Bagdad, and Byzantium… but
destroyed only a god in yourself.”</p>

<p>“I’ll keep the cup,” Karganlyk snapped. “Take
all the rest if you like!”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, his eyes were sad. “I see. Tell
me: who set you on two lone travelers? We are entrapped. You can
speak bluntly.”</p>

<p>Karganlyk gazed at his old enemy. His painted
face twitched, his lips stretched into thin lines, his sharp
wolfish teeth flashed. He looked eager to say the dreadful truth,
to fling it into his eyes, to see fear in the Old Sorcerer’s face –
but Karganlyk might have recalled Oleg escaping in spite of bounds,
or he was restrained by some other reason, but he only growled, “A
dog is set on. And I’m a great chieftain! My life is guarded by
gods.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Oleg agreed with no hint of jeer,
“you’re a great chieftain. Of a great tribe. Though not numerous,
is it? Do you have hundred men? Ten years ago, you had thousand.
And twenty years ago – ten thousand. How many will you have next
year?”</p>

<p>Karganlyk clenched his stone jaws. He had
barely retained from a strike, his fingers fumbling about his belt.
“One hero is enough to give birth to a new nation,” he said in a
dull voice. “You know it.”</p>

<p>“I know,” Oleg agreed. “A hero. Not a
beast.”</p>

<p>Karganlyk’s eyes flashed. “Whilst I live, the
people of Khazar lives!” he snarled.</p>

<p>“Even gods die,” Oleg told him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 13</p>

<p>Karganlyk straightened up, his eyes blazing.
Oleg put his hand on the sword hilt. For a while, they tried to
crack each other with eyes, then Karganlyk turned away and ran
down, jumping among the rocks sprightly. Down in the valley, Hazars
stirred, rushing to meet him. Oleg hurried up the slope, saving his
distance to Hazars, poor archers. <emphasis>No Khazars anymore. Those were
splendid riders and marksmen, dangerous enemies. These are just a
bestial gang: unable to build anything, and even out of their skill
to destroy.</emphasis></p>

<p>The northern end of the cleft was guarded by
marauders, the southern – by villains. The helmets of two knights
glittered over the middle of the ridge. Mortal enemies, they,
however, felt more in common with each other than with other men,
brigands and deserters. Chachar bustled among the three groups like
a messenger among warring hosts. She was the only one welcome
anywhere. Her cheeks flushed with happiness. <emphasis>That’s her paradise
– only men around</emphasis>.</p>

<p>“How’s your trade?” Gorvel cried to Oleg,
while Thomas breathed out with relief..</p>

<p>“As usual: no swindle, no sale. He offered us
to leave the cup and get away.”</p>

<p>Ronald uttered a loud hem. “We need agree!”
he expressed the common opinion of his comrades and also villains.
“Even if cup is golden, our lives are golder!”</p>

<p>Gorvel and Thomas said nothing. Chachar
grasped Oleg by hand, her eyes glittered with tears. “You refused?
Why?”</p>

<p>“After he takes a cup, he will take us.”</p>

<p>“What’s the point for him to lose his men?”
Gorvel said warily. “We’ll kill much of his, and he’ll gain only
the same thing he hopes to get for nothing!”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t need the cup,” Oleg replied. “He
needs us. He was told that Sir Gorvel carries all the family jewels
with him. They cost enough to hire a small army or build a
medium-sized fortress. Sir Gorvel, you may find it hard to believe
that your masters have set him on you, but it’s in the spirit of
progress. Hazars can’t be commanded in the way you were, but these
base creatures are easy to be manipulated by playing on their
greed, envy, and malice!”</p>

<p>Gorvel turned pale, his hand darted to the
sword hilt. At once, Thomas and Roland, the leader of marauders,
drew their swords and covered the wonderer. “And the cup…” Oleg
continued. “Karganlyk will give it to those who pointed at the rich
prey, as a gratitude for their hint. Who needs that plain cup, Sir
Gorvel?”</p>

<p>Gorvel sheathed his sword with a thud, turned
away. The marauders and villains exchanged suspicious, unbelieving
glances. Kings, basileuses, and sultans were legendary creatures.
Just as gods, demons, and peries. None of those is to be
encountered by ordinary men, so forget them and only rely upon your
own strength, fortune, and lucky star!</p>

<p>“What will we do?” Roland inquired. He
stepped out of the group of marauders. “Holy father, we see you
definitely have met these devils before. And those meetings might
have been hard, as you know their military habits. That horned
devil was talking to you respectfully, we all saw. And he’s the
kind of demon to escape no censer but a hard fist. And he kept
glancing, other men say if I lie, at your fists, not your
charms!”</p>

<p>Oleg fingered absent-mindedly the charms on
his breast. “We’ll have to wait. We can’t leave without horses. The
mountain must have been surrounded, but they won’t attack at night.
I know it.”</p>

<p>“We ran short of water,” Roland reminded. He
licked his dry lips. “And they’ll pour it over selves in the
morning! A spring half a mile from here.”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head sadly. “We have no other
choice. The roads are busy here. The forces of Barons and Saracens
often ride through this valley. If any of them comes, the wild
Hazars will be driven away. They are hated by everyone.”</p>

<p>Roland stepped back but his eyes were
doubtful. The marauders took a quiet counsel, and the Black Beard,
who had kept silent up to that moment, roared, “If! Your ‘if’
brought death to all of mine! Let the pilgrim have his ways, and
we’ll have ours. Once it’s dark, we try to break through. Some of
us die, but others live. Or we all die with this fool!”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, his hand darted to the sword
hilt. Gorvel puffed up, stepped closer to him. Oleg flung his fist
swiftly. There was a muffled tinkle of helmet. For a moment, the
Black Beard stood with goggled eyes, then his knees bent, he
collapsed face first. The dumfounded villains watched his iron
helmet, which had fell to the ground, and a dent in it, then
shifted their gazes to the bare fist of peaceful pilgrim.</p>

<p>“You… killed him?” Gorvel asked.</p>

<p>“It would have pleased Hazars. He’ll soon
come to.”</p>

<p>Gorvel breathed out with relief. “I’m glad
that <emphasis>you</emphasis> are our sultan, sheikh, and king! If I were you, I
couldn’t help killing that churl!”</p>

<p>Thomas bent his head and said nothing: he’d
also have killed the villain with great pleasure. The Black Beard
groaned, turned on his back with effort. A marauder who was
smirking malevolently from ear to ear kicked the empty helmet to
him, left it in the position for the dent to be well seen.</p>

<p>The Black Beard’s hair on the left side of
the head was matted with blood. He moaned and sat up, resting both
hands on the ground. “Take your cut-throats,” Oleg told him mildly.
“The watch before midnight is yours. Then these brave soldiers of
imperial guard change you.”</p>

<p>The Black Beard touched his badly-hurt head,
stood up and left without saying a word. <emphasis>Even villains can’t
object to such forcible arguments.</emphasis></p>

<p>At night, Oleg and Thomas crawled on their
bellies on the bare ground, peering at the rocks shimmering in the
starlight. The silence was broken by rare howls of jackals. In the
valley far below, a red fire could be seen. In times it
disappeared, as a vigilant sentinel walked past.</p>

<p>Gorvel had a long talk with Roland, glancing
back at Thomas and Oleg frequently. They seemed to have reached a
consent at last, as they covered themselves with cloaks and lay
down to sleep. Villains stood the first watch. Chachar sat with
them for a while, staring in the dark with resent for Thomas for
his paying her too little attention. However, she was almost the
first to fall asleep.</p>

<p>Oleg fingered his charms. A wooden figure of
hare was caught frequently. If he got the right meaning of that
sign sent by his eternal, all-seeing and all-knowing soul, someone
was going to run away, trying to save his skin.</p>

<p>The Black Beard, with his bandaged head, was
lying at the other end of the cleft. Next to him, Oleg saw the
heads of his survived villains. One of the marauders, a taciturn
beastlike man, sat beside them, exchanging some quiet remarks with
them.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg looked at each other. Thomas
alerted, pulled his sheathed sword towards himself. “Is there a way
out?” he whispered hopefully. “I must get out!”</p>

<p>“I see. The Holy Grail–”</p>

<p>“Krizhina waits for me! If I linger, brothers
will make her marry!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s serious, I see. But we have to
wait. For some host to pass by, for something else to happen… This
land is no wild steppes for Hazars to invade without being seen!
Someone somewhere is already blowing trumpets, saddling
horses…”</p>

<p>“They’ll be late,” Thomas sighed. “We have to
set hopes upon a miracle.”</p>

<p>Oleg heard a heavy sigh in the dark, as if
one were carrying the whole cleft on his back. He smirked sadly.
All the way, the knight had been telling with ardor about the
miracles made by first Christians at the least occasion. <emphasis>And
when nothing is left to us but belief in miracles, he lost his
heart.</emphasis></p>

<p>Far below, on the left side of their crevice,
a stone tapped lightly on stone. As the man saw himself spotted, he
dashed across the moonlit area and vanished in the shade, only his
hard soles stamped hastily on the rocks.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back at the sentinels. The Black
Beard was in place, one of his villains with him, a sullen marauder
sitting nearby and grinding his dagger, but another villain had
disappeared. The Black Beard shook his fist angrily after the
runaway.</p>

<p>Gorvel swore. “I’d rather expect it of their
leader! That scum is going to those mountains. And Hazars are far.
The bastard must have robbed us! And he’s leaving!”</p>

<p>“Will he leave?” Oleg asked with doubt.
Thomas shifted his gaze between the wonderer and the red-bearded
knight.</p>

<p>“I stake my arms and armor,” Gorvel said
sharply, “on his successful leave. He walks light and far from
Hazars. See their fire?”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at the far fire, far even from
the foot of the hill. His face darkened.</p>

<p>“I bet my head to your armor, sir,” Oleg told
Gorvel sadly. “Hazars have made fires there deliberately for us to
see. In fact, two score of warriors lay in ambush among those
rocks, in half a hundred steps from us, and listen, trying to guess
what we do, what we are going to do, what we hope on. That’s a
common tactics of Hazars! I’m surprised to find you, Sir Gorvel, a
man of war, that easy to be dece–”</p>

<p>They heard a scream in hundred steps in the
dark. A heavy body hit against the stone, pebbles clattered down
the slope. A scream again: muffled, as if the man was silenced
while uttering it. Dead silence fell, broken only by distant sounds
of fast feet running away.</p>

<p>Thomas turned to Gorvel briskly, with his
eyes shining like lynx’s and a wide smile from ear to ear. “You
armor, Sir Gorvel!”</p>

<p>“Not now,” Oleg interfered hurriedly. “He’ll
need it to fight.”</p>

<p>Gorvel fidgeted, as he forced himself to
speak with great embarrassment and displeasure. “Sir Thomas, I’ve
lost my armor. It belongs to sir wonderer. I, a knight, made a
mistake. You and your friend know the ways of filthy barbarians
better. That’s no surprise for me…”</p>

<p>Oleg saw Thomas’s face darkening in the faint
moonlight and put his heavy hand on the knight’s shoulder to keep
him from a furious lung. The cleft was dark. They heard marauders
speaking in angry, irritated voices. “Keep a vigilant watch,” Oleg
told them in a warning tone. “Over the rocks and bushes. Memorize
their positions.”</p>

<p>A dark figure turned to him. When the man
spoke, Oleg recognized the voice of Roland, the leader of
marauders. “I know such tricks. They won’t steal up.”</p>

<p>“See to no one sleeping on the watch!”</p>

<p>Roland hemmed. His reply sounded a bitter
irony. “Everyone heard of Hazars. A bit at least. Who can sleep
when his hair stands on end?”</p>

<p>Oleg turned away from him. “Let no one try to
get out alone!” Thomas added in a peremptory tone of a lordly
knight.</p>

<p>Roland laughed. “If anyone nursed such idea,
he trampled and grinded it by now!”</p>

<p>Oleg saw their faces, white in the dark.
Woken up by the hushed voices, people looked at him with hope. He
adjusted the bow and the quiver on his back, checked his knives.
“I’ll go and have a close look at their camp.”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped. “But how you… get there?
You’ve said we are surrounded. They sit behind every stone. A fly
won’t pass!”</p>

<p>“There are no flies at night,” Oleg replied
indifferently. “Only gnats… Sir Thomas, I’m not a steel-thundering
knight, nor a villain. Slavs are taught as children to steal up to
an animal! A child grasps a wild goose, an adult can jump on the
back of the keenest deer… When coming back, I’ll give a whistle, so
you won’t shoot me in case if you hear my steps.” He backed and
vanished in the night. Thomas, Gorvel and all the rest listened
tensely, watched the starry sky closely, but no star vanished
behind a moving figure, no twig snapped, no pebble clicked.</p>

<p>A scatter of smooth stones looked like a herd
of giant turtles frozen in the chill of the night. The sentinels
kept counting the largest rocks. The Black Beard shot two arrows in
a boulder that seemed suspicious to him and saw it sinking a bit,
changing its shape slightly. When the moon came out again from
behind a cloud, the boulder was not in place.</p>

<p>Oleg moved in the night, as silent as a bat.
In times stopped, pressed against the ground, smelled unwashed
bodies and horse sweat, listened to the creaks of belts and breath
of men. Once he made out a full picture, to the smallest detail, he
moved on, slipping past Hazars in their hide. There were not two
scores of barbarians around their refuge, as Oleg had supposed, but
twice that number, or even more. Karganlyk was so craving to get
the Holy Grail that he’d sent half his tribe to guard, for no one
to slip out, to crawl away, to dig into burrows.</p>

<p>As Oleg lay on the rocks, he listened to
jackals roaming around the Hazar camp. A skilled hunter reads the
voices of animals as easily as their tracks, so Oleg, still being
far from the camp, knew that there were no more than hundred Hazars
and twice that number of horses, three bonfires, six killed rams,
and human flesh cooked on spits: Hazars, unlike Khazars, used to
eat not only dead enemies but their own dead too.</p>

<p>He slipped down into the valley, started
stealing up to the bonfires. He stopped dead at the strange sounds:
mumbles and measured trample, as if several men were making a
gloomy ritual dance. Oleg sneaked closer and saw, against the
starry sky, a massive wooden cross, a white body on it. The poor
man was crucified. <emphasis>The villain who tried to escape alone.</emphasis>
Oleg recognized the dark stripes on his body at once: they were
where Hazars had cut the man’s skin off to make their belts of it.
The villain’s mouth was gagged tightly. <emphasis>They don’t want his
voice to get hoarse before time.</emphasis> They would let him shriek as
much as he wished in the morning, for Oleg and his small party to
see and hear what awaited for them.</p>

<p>Four Hazars were stamping on the soft ground
around the cross dug into, driving stones and wedges under its
base. Dark blood was streaming down the cross. The villain’s feet
were set against the ground, otherwise the nails couldn’t have kept
his body. Hazars had not only cut belts of him: they maimed the
bottom of his belly, pulled out his male parts.</p>

<p>Noiselessly, Oleg took his bow off, emptied
the arrows on the ground. He hesitated for a while and laid down a
throwing knife too, though it was hard to shoot an arrow while
lying and throwing a knife was even worse.</p>

<p>He loosed the first arrow after a thorough
aim-taking. Then he’d snatch the next one by feather hastily, draw
in a flash, shoot and grasp another arrow at once. The first Hazar
was shot in throat, two more – in heads before they could cry, but
the fourth one had time to see the glitter of arrowhead in the
dark. He jumped aside, a saber flashed in hand.</p>

<p>Oleg threw the knife with force. The Hazar
fell, the hilt stuck out of his left eye socket. Oleg caught the
body, flinched at the blood pouring over him, put it noiselessly on
the ground.</p>

<p>From the Hazar camp, he heard common sounds
of any nomad camp where half of men are awake, whetting their
swords, putting heads on their arrows and spears, while the
sentinels mostly watch the bonfires and meat on spits.</p>

<p>He wiped the throwing knife clean, tucked it
in place. While he ran around the cross and gathered his arrows, he
kept listening to the sounds of noisy Hazar camp. He approached
cautiously, flinching at every chirr of grasshoppers. There was no
suspicious noise, no signs of alarm, and Oleg breathed out with
great relief. At the blaze of farther bonfires, he saw many Hazars
drinking heavily the befuddling soma, chewing death caps. Their
faces twitched, contorted, froze in awful grimaces.</p>

<p>He was looking out for Karganlyk when someone
pushed him on back. “Why ramble in dark?” an angry voice said in
the spoiled tongue of Eastern Khazars who had turned Hazars. “Carry
the wood–”</p>

<p>Oleg wheeled round, pulling out his knife.
Two Hazars glared at him, the third one behind them was dragging a
dry log with effort. Oleg kicked the first Hazar in groin. At the
same time, the knife vanished from hand to appear as a hilt stuck
in the throat of the second enemy. Oleg jumped on the third Hazar
who dropped the log and goggled his eyes in fear. He let out a
terrible yell that stopped abruptly with a shrill sob.</p>

<p>Oleg dashed aside, fell, rolled over his head
and stopped dead, sprawling on the ground, his ear pressed on it.
He heard screams at the camp, a loud clatter of hooves. Someone
darted across the fire, scattering hot coals. The sleeping Hazars
were jumping up with dreadful yells, in burning clothes. Only those
befuddled by soma and death caps did not stir.</p>

<p>Oleg cast anxious glances at the dark sky.
The light spot of moon vanished in fast running clouds in time, but
another time it shone through them too brightly, threatening to
fall out into the clear sky. He would be exposed then!</p>

<p>He ran off a bit, crouched, watching and
listening to know who was where, how many of them, where they
headed. Karganlyk did not show up, though Oleg heard his stentorian
roar twice. He started to sneak there but soon heard the leader’s
voice from another side, as if Karganlyk had felt the danger and
was hiding or trying to decoy Oleg into ambush.</p>

<p>The turmoil went on. <emphasis>They found the bodies
and are combing the valley through!</emphasis> Oleg started a quiet
retreat to the mountain. Warned by the trample of hooves or feet
beforehand, he fell on the ground each time, merged into its
hummocks, pretended to be a boulder. One Hazar was too fast to come
upon him, no time to dodge. Oleg had to punch him on head to
stun.</p>

<p>Thomas and Gorvel were awake, peering at the
far bonfires. In two steps, the Black Beard was scuffing with
concentration, as he whetted his curved sword, checked it carefully
with his nail, as thick as a hoof, and moved the rough whetstone
lovingly on the blade again.</p>

<p>“You friend is a man of great courage,”
Gorvel remarked at last. “A civilized man would never take such a
risk, but he’s a Pagan, as those wild Hazars are. He’s a match for
them.”</p>

<p>“He has enough civilization and enough
culture,” Thomas snapped. “He knows the Holy Writ, though he
doesn’t appreciate it. Sometimes it seems to me he has met all the
great prophets in person: so profound his knowledge of their words
and their ideas!”</p>

<p>“Then his soul belongs to Satan,” Gorvel told
him with confidence. “Are you sure he’s not Satan himself? Or one
of his servants? Not the least of them! Some things he does… I
wonder whether they are possible for any man.”</p>

<p>Thomas pondered over it, then his face lit.
“He held the Holy Grail in hands! And it can’t be touched by one
with foul intents. By the way… Can <emphasis>you</emphasis> take it?”</p>

<p>Gorvel turned away. He stared into the dark
for a long time. The reply he gave afterwards sounded steady and
confident, as if he felt great powers behind. “I treat the cup of
Christ’s blood with too much respect to lay dirty fingers on it.
Once I’m back to my castle… either old or new one… a priest will
absolve me of all my sins, however small. Then I’ll take it.”</p>

<p>“That will be a long confession,” Thomas
said. “You’ll get old before you finish it!”</p>

<p>Chachar tossed anxiously in her sleep under
Thomas’s cloak, whispered something. Thomas walked aside not to
wake her, glad at the opportunity to move away from despicable
Gorvel: the veil creature who robbed his guest of the Holy Grail
and then tried to kill him treacherously, throwing heavy stones
down at him… <emphasis>And this monster doesn’t burn of shame. He speaks
to me as if nothing happened! He could keep closer to villains, men
of his own sort, but instead he’s hanging around me, an honest
man.</emphasis></p>

<p>Suddenly, they heard screams from the dark
valley below. The closest bonfire blazed up. Thomas saw tiny
figures of men rushing around it, then some riders galloping past
like ghosts. Then other bonfires blazed up too. There was a glitter
of blades, furious shouts grew louder.</p>

<p>“They captured him!” Gorvel cried with
obvious vexation.</p>

<p>“At least he managed to kill some of them!”
Thomas replied angrily. “Unlike us. We’ll die without any
glory.”</p>

<p>“They wouldn’t make such ado for nothing,”
Gorvel agreed.</p>

<p>The Black Beard woke another villain up,
cursing furiously. Together with the marauders who had jumped up,
they peered with fear and anxiety at the far bonfires and darting
figures. Then the Black Beard climbed out of the cleft. “We can get
out!” he cried excitedly. “They have pilgrim, all their attention
on him. I don’t know whose holy relics he worshipped, but I beat
he’s killed at least one of theirs! And they forgot us!”</p>

<p>“And the devils that guard us?” another
villain asked him.</p>

<p>“They must have run down. And if some
remained… you’ve served in the imperial guard, haven’t you?”</p>

<p>The marauders exchanged glances, started to
climb out of the cleft. Swords and daggers glittered in their
hands. Chachar jumped up, wrapping herself in Thomas’s cloak with
cold, and clung to the knight.</p>

<p>Gorvel hesitated, his eyes shifted from
villains and marauders in their leave to Thomas and shivering
Chachar. “Sir Thomas, we’ll have to join this scum for a while.
Even if they die all, two of us, the strongest knights, will break
through! And then we settle our dispute in combat. Agreed?”</p>

<p>“No,” Thomas snapped resolutely. “My friend
is captured by enemies. I’m bound to save him. Or die trying to
save him.”</p>

<p>“Bound!” Gorvel jeered. “What about our
duel?”</p>

<p>“My sword will find you, scoundrel,” Thomas
told him with loathing. “But first I’ll try to rescue sir wonderer.
If I perish, it will be a death of Christian warrior.”</p>

<p>“Your death will be neither Christian nor
worthy of a warrior,” Gorvel objected. “You don’t see what’s behind
you!”</p>

<p>Thomas wheeled round – and saw empty mountain
slope, all dark. He heard Chachar squeal in fright, started turning
back to Gorvel but a violent header came down on him. With a flash
of white fire before eyes, he fell silently on the ground, rolled
few steps down into the cleft. Gorvel raised his axe to descend
there and cleave the knight’s head, but the marauders and villains
had vanished from sight: he could only hear their heavy breath,
clang of arms, and trample of feet. He swore and ran after them,
sent the crying Chachar flying off his way.</p>

<p>Weeping loudly, Chachar collapsed on the cold
iron body. Thomas did not stir, and when she managed to raise his
visor a bit, her fingers found something wet, hot, and sticky.</p>

<p>A red stripe emerged on the east, but the
knight’s unblinking eyes were fixed on the fading stars.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 14</p>

<p>They ran past the first belt of stones, then
the second one – and clashed suddenly with Hazars, only two of
them. A villain fell with his head cleaved but the Hazars were
slashed, and the party rushed down, stamping their boots. There was
no point trying to conceal themselves anymore: before the
barbarians died, they’d screamed, and a scream answered from
below.</p>

<p>Twice they were caught up by Hazar parties
gathered in a hurry. Gorvel and marauders passed through both of
them and lost no men. Only the last of brigands, the Black Beard,
fell down, transfixed with two arrows. Dying, he broke the neck of
a screaming sturdy Hazar who was tattooed all over.</p>

<p>For the third time – they had already changed
from run to walk, almost sure they’d thrown Hazars off – a big
party came upon them. A fierce battle struck up, and no one ran
away. A savage beast awoke in every man. Hazars screamed,
scratched, bit, and even spat, but marauders also went bestial: if
they lost their swords, they gnawed at enemies.</p>

<p>When the fight was over, only three men stood
on their feet among many bloodshed corpses: Gorvel, Roland, and one
of his soldiers. The three of them bared their teeth, breathing
heavily, too exhausted to move or speak. The valley was silent.</p>

<p>Gorvel raised his sword. “We have to get
away,” he said in a hoarse voice. “We broke through but there are
lots of devils back in the camp. And that horned monster!”</p>

<p>The eastern edge of the sky was going
lighter. Gorvel could see the tired faces of his random companions.
The stars were fading gradually. In the twilight of the dawn, some
dark half-ruined rocks were seen here and there. The three men,
making no common plan, hurried into the same conglomeration of
stones. <emphasis>Once the sun rises, the Hazars will pursue us
ahorse.</emphasis></p>

<p>The clouds in the sky blazed red, as if they
were splattered with blood, the air became clear and transparent –
when the ground was knocked away from under their feet at once.
Gorvel and marauders were so sure they’d left Hazars behind that
they had no time to draw swords when half-naked bodies seemed to
emerge out of thin air. A huge boulder flew up. Gorvel only had
time to see that it was actually a shield, deliberately caked in
mud, and glimpse Karganlyk’s ferocious face under it.</p>

<p>Gorvel gripped the sword hilt. A massive hulk
fell on him, blocking his breath. He moaned and saw a glitter of
evil joy in small malevolent eyes. He clenched his teeth, struggled
away, but Karganlyk squeezed his body with more force. Gorvel’s
bones cracked, a groan burst out with his breath. He tasted hot and
salty. “To the valley!” Karganlyk ordered Hazars. “These ones will
be dying a very long time, for our gods to rejoice!”</p>

<p>Gorvel was tied up to a stout pole. Four
Hazars shouldered it, hastened down to the valley. Roland was
carried behind. Gorvel heard curses and grasped that the third of
their party had also been taken alive. He roared and swore dirtily
but stopped in the middle of a sentence, Gorvel heard a muffled
thud, as if a stone were hit by a thick stick.</p>

<p>The radiant edge of sun appeared over the
horizon when the captives were eventually brought to the camp.
Hazars tore clothes off them, threw Gorvel’s armor down in a heap,
then pulled it on a wooden block. Roland clenched his teeth, gloomy
and enduring, but another marauder, as he came to, reviled the
torturers again: threated, mocked, and spat at them. Hazars went
furious but no one, in fear of their formidable leader, dared to
finish the captive off, which he obviously strove for. They spat on
the three captives in return, flung clods of mud at them.</p>

<p>They were stretched face up on the ground,
their limbs tied to dug-in stakes. Gorvel gritted his teeth, trying
not to let a moan out, as his joints cracked, his sinews all but
burst at the strain. He saw nothing but the sky and, in times, the
laughing mugs of enemies. Ugly and tattooed, they jumped, grimaced,
screamed. Many of them used the opportunity to water the sprawled
enemies. Soon Gorvel was bathed in stinky urine. His head remained
free, he could shake it sideways. Hazars laughed and slapped on
their bare knees when the proud knight closed his eyes tight. Some
ready-witted one fetched a wooden funnel, thrust it into the
knight’s jaws, and watered into it, screaming happily and jumping,
while Gorvel coughed desperately and choked. The mob around roared
with laughter</p>

<p>Karganlyk appeared suddenly, furious. He
kicked Gorvel, the knight heard the crunch of own broken ribs.
“Where’s the Old Sorcerer? One with green eyes?”</p>

<p>Gorvel winced with pain in his broken ribs,
but his lips curled in a malevolent smirk. “You haven’t got
him?”</p>

<p>“I would if only I met him face to face! But
he killed nine my best warriors! I will torture him for long, very
long!”</p>

<p>“Catch him at first,” Gorvel croaked, feeling
evil strength still in him. “Nine under your very nose? This wolf
will kill all of yours, like sheep. He only plays a pious man… When
devil is old, he shall take monkhood…”</p>

<p>Karganlyk kicked him again. That time he
smashed the knight’s cheekbone to bleeding with joy. “Hey you, at
the fire! Irons ready? Let’s see how tough he is.”</p>

<p>Hazars went darting eagerly around the fire.
There was a crackle, a smell of iron burnt hot. Roland, crucified
on Gorvel’s right, cried to cheer him up, “Hold on, sir! Let’s show
these monsters how a European dies!”</p>

<p>“Show the infidels how the soldiers of
imperial guard die!” another marauder shouted, interspersing it
with curses.</p>

<p>“I need no encouragement from scum like you,”
Gorvel told them angrily. “Shut up! Everyone dies alone.”</p>

<p>Karganlyk snatched a rod from the Hazar who
came running. Its crimson end emitted dry heat. “When you trample
on the faith of others”, he roared wildly, “you confirm your own!
It’s the behest of our forefathers.” His eyes glittered with
madness, yellow saliva foamed in the corners of his mouth. Looking
in Gorvel’s face, he started bringing the red-hot rod to the
knight’s eyes.</p>

<p>Gorvel tried not to wink. He looked straight
at the rod, despite his face burnt with heat and his eyebrows
crackling. He smelled burnt hair.</p>

<p>Karganlyk touched Gorvel’s nostrils slightly
with the red-hot end, then took it away, watched the knight grimace
helplessly, suppressing a cry. As he started bringing the rod down
again, he promised, “You’ll be screaming for very long…”</p>

<p>Suddenly, he shuddered from head to feet,
straightened up convulsively, his back bent in such a way as if the
small of it were hit by a log. His mouth opened for a silent cry. A
wooden shaft topped with a white feather was in his left socket.
The arrowhead had broken through his skull and gone out from the
back of the head, dripping with blood. In spite of terror and
disgust, Gorvel spotted that the arrowhead looked no iron but a
strange silvery metal shimmering like moonlight!</p>

<p>Karganlyk sobbed, raised his hands, as though
to grip the injured place. His fingers unclenched, the red-hot rod
dropped on Gorvel’s bare chest. Karganlyk swung back and forth,
hanging over the sprawled Gorvel, then collapsed slowly on his
back. The hard heavy body hit the ground with a force that made it
tremble and lurch.</p>

<p>Disbelieving, Hazars watched their invincible
leader whose face was now covered with dark blood, red bubbles rose
from the gurgling mass in place of his socket. Immortal Karganlyk,
the awe and demigod of their tribe, the hope of rebirth of their
bygone glory… lay in dust, as dead as a road stone!</p>

<p>Someone screamed in terror, turned and ran
away. Other backed, their widened eyes fixed on the ruin of their
leader. A dreadful shriek burst out from them before they wheeled
round and fled without choosing their way. The tread of bare feet
was everywhere, along with the stiffing dust raised by them, the
clatter of stones. Mad Hazars were climbing up the slope, having
abandoned their horses, things, camp, and captives.</p>

<p>Roland and his man stopped cursing, turned
their heads after the runaways. Gorvel groaned through gritted
teeth: the damned Hazar had dropped the red-hot rod on his naked
body and before it got cold, a furrow was branded in his flesh! The
knight smelled his own burnt flesh as he breathed.</p>

<p>When the footfall died away, the strange
pilgrim, a friend of Sir Thomas, showed up. He walked unhurriedly,
without looking around, the bow and quiver of arrows jutted out
over his shoulder. On his go, he drew a knife, cut Roland’s hands
free in two easy moves.</p>

<p>The leader of marauders goggled his eyes.
“Why they took such a flight? Three score men!”</p>

<p>“Karganlyk was a live god to them,” Oleg
explained. “Without him, they are nothing.”</p>

<p>Another marauder, still stretched on the
stakes, swore. “You know how to treat them, holy father!” he said
with a malevolent smirk. “You <emphasis>know</emphasis>… The arrowhead no iron –
it’s silver! I have keen eye for such things.”</p>

<p>Wincing, Roland kneaded his swollen wrists.
His back was numb, he bent forward with effort to untie his feet.
“Barbarians!.. We, soldiers of imperial guard, would have fought to
the last man. Whether the Emperor alive or dead, we are
personalities! No wild mob.”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded. “Look here, personality. See a
hundred of Hazar horses over there? No, twice that number.
Unsaddled, but that’s how they do. Such horses are a fortune for
you, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>Roland bared his big teeth. “Holy father! May
your Pagan gods reward you for your kindness. This is our Christian
God, and all the saints and martyrs, who speak with your mouth now.
Two poor former soldiers of imperial guard do have a great need of
two Hazar horses. Of four, if to count spare ones!”</p>

<p>He tossed the rope off his feet, got up. A
saber abandoned by some Hazar glittered aside. He took it, cut the
limbs of his comrade free. Supporting each other, they plodded to
the horses that grazed in the thick green grass. As they walked,
they picked up things left by Hazars: weapons, clothes, boots.
Roland’s comrade glanced back at Oleg thievishly, as he grabbed
Gorvel’s thin coat of mail and expensive sword of Damask steel.
Oleg nodded as a sign that Gorvel had no further need of those.
Smirking openly, the marauders caught horses and rode away. Each of
them had taken two remounts.</p>

<p>Behind Oleg, Gorvel croaked with his dry
throat, “It’s time to unbind me too!”</p>

<p>Oleg turned to him with a still face.
“Faithful Christians are saved by angels, as your legends say. Are
you a Christian? No, because you serve the Secret Seven.”</p>

<p>“Damn you! What do you want?”</p>

<p>“Nothing,” Oleg replied sadly. “Before I came
here, I’d been to our cleft. Yes, I found Sir Thomas.” He turned
his back to Gorvel, made a couple of steps away, turning the
scattered Hazar things with the toe of his boot.</p>

<p>Gorvel twitched helplessly, being stretched
in the sturdy ropes, cried after Oleg in a strained voice, “You are
worse than Hazars!.. That’s a war! One of us <emphasis>had</emphasis> to die. I
had to kill him, and I killed…”</p>

<p>Oleg picked a bag up, thrust his forearm
inside, searching, Suddenly, his motionless face lit with a
condescending smirk. He pulled out the familiar cup with greenish
edges, looked it over, tossed back into the bag and then told
Gorvel with a slight surprise, “Why do you think you’d killed?
Thomas is a knight, not a thinker. His weak point is his heart, not
head.”</p>

<p>He shouldered the bag and made his way to the
foot of the mountain. Gorvel groaned, as he had nobody more to
conceal his despair in front of. Some dark points sprang up in the
blue cloudless sky. They expanded slowly, moving in uneven circles.
Bathed in own sweat and the urine of others, Gorvel suddenly felt
cold under the scorching rays of southern sun. He did not know who
were first to come to the battlefield in these lands: crows,
griffons, eagles, vultures, or jackals, but he had no doubt that
soon he would know it.</p>

<p>He closed his eyes convulsively, almost
feeling a strong beak pecking on his eyeballs.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>At the fork in the road, Oleg reined up in
hesitation. The mountain and the valley where the last Hazars –
barbarized offspring of the proud founders of Khazar Kaganat – had
terminated their existence was behind them. Chachar and Thomas,
still pallid, rode mighty Frankish horses. Behind each of them, two
remounts carried their load.</p>

<p>Thomas suffered of pounding in his ears. He
did not mind where to go. All he wanted was to get as soon as
possible to his native Britain where beautiful Lady Krizhina
counted in fear the days that remained before Saint Boromir’s Day.
The next morning after it, her brothers, hating Thomas, would force
her to the altar with abominable Meloun who had no virtues but a
long pedigree and a pair of short legs!</p>

<p>Oleg hesitated. The broad road straight ahead
is broken, in some several hundreds of miles, by a narrow strait
that separates two worlds: Asia and Europe. On the opposite shore,
there lies Constantinople: the city of cities, the second Rome. And
if they ride straight for some more hundreds or thousands of miles,
the road will lead them to the next channel, with gloomy rocks on
the other shore of it: the cold shore of Britain. “We’ll spend the
night here,” he resolved suddenly. “Something wrong about the city
ahead.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said in a faint voice,
“it seems to me we’ll have to winter among Saracen!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, you don’t cling to your life,
but what about the cup?”</p>

<p>Thomas touched the bag involuntarily. Now he
would not allow the cup away from himself even for a moment. He
carried it on his mount, mistrusting other horses.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, you’d better lie down,” Chachar
said hastily.</p>

<p>“If that’s an invitation…” Thomas began
hesitantly.</p>

<p>“You look unwell,” she hurried to
explain.</p>

<p>They dismounted aside from the road, in a
bunch of trees. Oleg unsaddled horses, while Thomas and Chachar
went for brushwood. Chachar boasted she knew herbs from her
grandmother, a famous witch, and promised to gather them. Thomas
gave Oleg an awkward look, warning him not to expect any wood to be
brought then.</p>

<p>Oleg gathered some dry twigs himself, made a
fire and peered at the dancing flames. He saw distinctly the riders
galloping, birds flying, flapping wings of dragons and ferocious
faces of warriors, hands raised in begging, the glitter of sabers…
<emphasis>In fire, everything changes swiftly, vanishes and comes back in
a different shape, showing only a bit of its nature, a hint. But
sorcerers are taught to know the trouble by a flash, as a hunter
knows the bird by its feather and the animal by its single
hair!</emphasis></p>

<p>He felt his hair raised with fear. A mortal
danger waited for them just at the city gate! <emphasis>Something vague
but related to blood, axes, horse hooves.</emphasis> If they went left,
then across the river, on the other side of the ferry, there was an
ambush of Saracen assassins. <emphasis>They’ll shoot point-blank from
strong crossbows – who gave British crossbows to them? – and finish
us off with curved Damask sabers.</emphasis> The road on the right was
barred by something indistinct but abominably dangerous. <emphasis>We’ll
definitely fall into its dreadful spider clutches if we go
there…</emphasis></p>

<p>His hair stirred with terror and revulsion.
He raised his hands with effort, clutched at his charms, like a
drowning man clutches at the tree roots hanging down. His
fingertips darted on the tiny wooden figures, searching for a
consolation, a salvation, any loophole among the surrounding traps,
snares, and pitfalls.</p>

<p>Thomas came back, against expectation, with a
huge armful of big thick poles. When Oleg asked about Chachar, he
shrugged and pointed vaguely at the north. Oleg boiled a herbal
potion. He would collect herbs at any occasion, even stoop from the
saddle on the go to pluck flowers. In case of need, he stopped,
dismounted, dug the whole plant out, trying not to damage its
roots. He filtered the potion to remove scum, let it settle. Thomas
lay near the fire with a faint smile: the very smell of the potion
was enough to stop his headache, to add some strength.</p>

<p>The shadows cast by nearest trees were
growing longer until they merged into a thick black veil. The
crimson sunlight moved up the trunks, threatening to fly up over
their tops soon and vanish. The light blue sky was turning navy
blue. In its right half, a pale crescent showed itself, the first
stars flashed. “Where the hell is she?” Oleg said in vexation.</p>

<p>“Searching for herbs,” Thomas replied
awkwardly. “Doing her best, sir wonderer. I’m not glad myself that
I’ve taken her as a burden, but… it happened this way.” Moaning in
times, he climbed out of his armor, put the iron pieces near the
fire to fry the maggots of pernicious flies.</p>

<p>“Where did she find herbs here?” Oleg
grumbled with a contempt he could not conceal.</p>

<p>“Behind the grove. She wanted to please you.
You look so formidable, severe. She’s afraid of you.”</p>

<p>“Behind the grove?” Oleg repeated anxiously.
“Too far. Not enough time for her to come back by night.”</p>

<p>“She took a horse,” Thomas said in a guilty
voice. “Doing her best! It’s sinful to blame such a sheep she is.
That sort is forgiven by God.”</p>

<p>“She’s a featherbrain, Sir Thomas! But how
could <emphasis>you</emphasis> let her go?”</p>

<p>Thomas looked aside awkwardly, his cheeks
flushed. “Sir wonderer. I was in a difficult situation. I told her
about my fidelity to fair Krizhina, and she told me we wouldn’t be
seen! I said that the Holy Virgin condemns even sinful thoughts,
and she said you were already sleeping. Or busy cooking a hare with
those spices that set our blood on fire…”</p>

<p>Oleg sat grim and silent. Thomas’s voice
sounded muffled, as if his ears were full of wool. The fire blazed,
flames changed swiftly: bloody-dark shadows gathered there,
highlighted by orange, almost white flashes. Ghostly riders
galloped swiftly, arrows flew, towers collapsed, cities burnt…</p>

<p>“Should we search for her?” Thomas offered
feebly but did not stir.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced at the dark sky swarming with
stars and shook his head. “Too dark to see tracks. If she’s not
back by dawn, we’ll ride to find her then. Summer nights are short
here. You can barely have a sleep before the day breaks.”</p>

<p>Chilled, Thomas woke up of cold. The fire had
burnt down. Against the lightening sky, he saw a figure of giant
carrying saddles, sword baldrics, and Thomas’s lance away. Horses
were snorting aside, rich grass crunched in their teeth. Not until
the dark figure came to the horses and started to saddle, did
Thomas shake his sleepy torpidity off and jump up, shivering and
flinching. “She didn’t come?”</p>

<p>“I’ve missed her,” Oleg replied sullenly.
“Let’s go and find her.”</p>

<p>“Forgive me, sir wonderer. It’s all my fault…
My double fault. We’d better have left her in that house.”</p>

<p>They mounted. Thomas checked himself and
thanked the wonderer with a casual nod, as he was not obliged to
saddle the knight’s horse. <emphasis>A common man, but a free yeoman, not
a landed villein. If he shows me respect, I must treat him the
same, as ordered by Our Lady</emphasis>. “To the grove?” Thomas asked.</p>

<p>“Go there. And I’ll ride to the left. There’s
a slope down to a stream sided by rich grass. Lots of different
roots. Both medicinal and poisonous.”</p>

<p>Thomas dashed to the grove while Oleg drove
his horse in an easy trot, watching the grass closely. The prints
of deer and boar hooves were frequent, and the green grass blades
were trampled down where smaller animals had been lying.</p>

<p>As Oleg rode across a narrow valley overgrown
with sparse shrubs, he heard a move behind far branches. Instantly,
he rolled off the saddle and on the ground, to escape an arrow shot
or a knife thrown at him, stopped behind a thick bush and became
all ears.</p>

<p>The valley was silent, except for carefree
grasshoppers chirring. Butterflies fluttered everywhere,
undisturbed, even over that suspicious bush. Oleg’s stallion
remained in place, nibbling with a crunch at the fresh green
leaves. His ears twitched angrily, as he drove away a big dragonfly
that kept trying to seat itself on their upright hairy ends. In a
soft whisper, Oleg ordered the horse to stand still – the master
knows better – and started to move in short quiet rushes, stooping
behind shrubs, his throwing knife ready in hand.</p>

<p>On the other side of the bushes, a saddled
horse grazed peacefully on a green lawn. Oleg returned noiselessly
to his own horse, mounted and rode around the shrubs, looking for
the rider, either dead or alive.</p>

<p>At the sight of Oleg, the empty horse gave an
anxious snort, alerted but did not run away. On the contrary, it
went toward him in a careful pace, greeted his stallion with a
quite neigh. Oleg recognized the horse of Chachar, stroked the
leather of its saddle. His fingers got sticky with blood.</p>

<p>Feeling creepy all over, Oleg seized its
reins, spurred his stallion. Both horses dashed on at full tilt.
Oleg kept his eyes on the hoof prints, barely visible on the hard
ground.</p>

<p>Judging by tracks, Chachar’s horse had been
strolling without the rider, stopping to nibble at the grass, then
turned to drink from a stream, ate the tops of shrubs in two
places. Thick grass was crumpled where the horse had been lying,
kicking up and down playfully.</p>

<p>The sky was darkening too fast. Oleg looked
up and groaned helplessly: a large dark cloud was coming upon, with
bitter brief flashes of lightnings in its black depth. The wind
blew in his back. <emphasis>That damned rain will wash the tracks off,
faint as they are!</emphasis></p>

<p>At a tilt, he stood up on his stirrups,
looked around. The wind bent down the blades of sparse grass, the
clouds climbed upon each other in many floors. Suddenly a white
glare came inside one cloud, a menacing rumble came moments after.
Nowhere in the steppes, as far as he could see, no one was lying,
sitting, or waving at him.</p>

<p>He had to bend lower, peering at the blurry
tracks until his eyes ached. In the dark that fell, he would have
not noticed an arrow shot at him, a lasso thrown, or even one
jumping onto his horse. The tracks were often lost… Suddenly his
blood ran cold: he saw traces of two unshod horses on the left.
Judging by the hoof prints, the horses were light and slim-legged,
as most horses in this land, and their riders had no heavy armor
on. Maybe they wore leather jacks: those would do to block a strike
of light saber or a shot of homemade bow.</p>

<p>As traces told him, the riders had taken a
brief counsel and ridden apart, searching for tracks of others.
Once they got certain of a lone rider on their way, they rode on
his tracks about a hundred of steps before they realized it was an
empty horse. <emphasis>They could have spotted it before.</emphasis> That was
when they retraced and urged their horses at a slow pace on the
tracks of a pedestrian, often stopping to peer at the trampled
grass and faint footprints.</p>

<p>Oleg whipped his horse. It was much easier to
follow the tracks of two horses, so he galloped, jumped over
shrubs. He saw the hoof prints were quite fresh. In some places,
trampled grass was straightening before his very eyes, in others
the milky white juice was still oozing from grass blades broken by
sharp hooves.</p>

<p>In the falling dark, a fearful branchy
lightning flashed, dazzling him. If her glare did not illumine the
thickening twilight, Oleg would have bumped at full tilt into a
couple of Arabian argamaks who stood in a narrow green valley.
Somewhat farther in the valley, two shaggy ragged men, knives on
their belts, were coming to Chachar with loud laughter. She backed,
but one man rounded her in a wide arc. Chachar stopped, jerked her
head up proudly. She was pale, her hair disheveled. Her eyes
flashed with the same lightnings as the sky.</p>

<p>Oleg reined up, snatched his bow. The
villains spotted the stranger, turned round to him: both sturdy,
hardened, and reckless, clad in leather armor of buffalo skin, with
plain hunting knives on their belts. Oleg drove his horse forward,
stopped in ten steps from them. The huge hilt of two-handed sword
looked out over his shoulder, an arrow on his bow string aimed at
the men. Its iron head had an evil glitter. Both villains could see
the stranger had no light Saracen bow but a formidable lamellar
one: an arrow shot of it would go through steel armor.</p>

<p>“Chachar!” Oleg called loudly. “Are you all
right?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she replied in a thin voice and added
hastily, “I’ve gathered many herbs! But these two fools hampered my
way back.”</p>

<p>Oleg looked at the villains, though,
actually, he never let them out of his sight before. “What do you
want?”</p>

<p>One glanced at his comrade who froze at spot,
his gaze fixed at the arrow. He estimated the distance to Oleg, to
their horses left behind the armed stranger with cold green eyes –
and spread his arms wide with a smile. “We just wanted to see. If
she needs help. People must help each other. It’s what Christ
wants, yeah?”</p>

<p>“It’s what all gods want,” Oleg said coldly.
“And they want our help to be disinterested.”</p>

<p>The villain, feeling the danger passing by,
broadened his smile, backed away from Chachar, trying to reach own
horse in an arc. “Only disinterested! Otherwise it’s no help.”</p>

<p>“And deserves other reward,” Oleg agreed. He
turned in his saddle, while his horse stood still, watched the
villains round him cautiously, making no spare moves, mount
quietly, ride a hundred of steps away in a slow pace. Only then
they dared to whoop and gallop away.</p>

<p>Oleg turned to Chachar, nodded at her horse
that stood behind still. “Mount! Quick!”</p>

<p>She darted to the horse with exaggerated
obedience, climbed into the saddle. Her big eyes were fixed on his
angry face. On her back, she had a tightly stuffed bag. Tender
stalks with round blue leaves looked out of it through a slit. Oleg
said nothing, as he had no wish to praise the woman. <emphasis>She’d try
to consolidate her position then.</emphasis> However, he noticed she’d
really collected the herbs of great healing power. <emphasis>And picked up
in the correct time of the day, which is extremely
important.</emphasis></p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The two of them sat by the fire. Chachar
gnawed at the roast quail wing and Oleg sorted the herbs out,
trying to let nothing but polite interest show in his face, when
they heard a clatter of hooves. Far away, there was the gleaming
figure of the knight.</p>

<p>Thomas vaulted off, with easiness that had
always surprised Oleg. The knight looked paler than usual. He
limped, his armor was dented in two places. The right side of his
helmet was matted, his eyebrows stuck together with sweat, his sky
blue eyes dark with pain. “I ran into them on my way,” he replied
with vexation to the anxious looks of Oleg and Chachar. “I can’t
make way for strangers! What if they’re of lower birth?.. The fools
pushed forward on me. The last two of them guessed to make way, but
it was late…”</p>

<p>Chachar dashed to the knight anxiously,
helped to unclasp his heavy armor, dropping the pieces on her legs.
“Damn the steppes!” Oleg said sarcastically. “So little space that
one can’t turn round!”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer! That’s a matter of honor!”</p>

<p>“Would you like to eat?”</p>

<p>“I am saturated with the fight,” Thomas
replied proudly, in the best knightly traditions.</p>

<p>Oleg did not try to persuade or argue. He
even seemed to be glad. “That’s well! Then you will drink a potion
we made.”</p>

<p>Thomas recoiled from the horribly stinking
caldron of black liquid, with floating yellow blades of grass,
which he would not throw even to his servant’s horse, and nasty
bubbling foam. From time to time, sharp little claws emerged from
inside, as if the wonderer had boiled bats or toads there. “Sir
wonderer!..”</p>

<p>“You need it, dear sir. The Holy Virgin would
have treat her knight to the cup of healing potion herself if only
she was not that busy.”</p>

<p>Chachar hurried to take a full scoop, brought
it to Thomas, trying to spill not a single drop of the precious
potion, for which she’d suffered so much, got scared to a piglet’s
squeal.</p>

<p>Oleg smiled derisively, as if he had little
belief in the knight’s valor.</p>

<p>Thomas held his breath and took the scoop of
nauseating potion with a firm hand.</p>

<p>Oleg ate unhurriedly the meat around the
bone. His strange green eyes looked slowly over the lawn,
overhanging branches, the ground trampled by hooves and feet.
Chachar sat on the other side of the fire, eating quickly and
accurately. She took the bones with two fingers, sticking the
little one out. She neither spat out the bones nor blew her nose at
the table, holding each of her nostrils in turn, in Saracen
way.</p>

<p>Oleg tossed the bone away, wiped his greasy
fingers. “Thomas, it’s our good luck that Chachar got lost.”</p>

<p>The knight started. “What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“We had guests. While we galloped over groves
and gullies in search of the maiden lost, they rode up to our fire
from three sides, to encircle us. Behind that tree, I found a track
of crossbow arc: someone was drawing a crossbow with its plate set
against the ground. I think there were other crossbowmen as
well.”</p>

<p>Thomas jumped up, his eyes were searching
around anxiously. “Where are they?”</p>

<p>“They thought we had left fire as a lure
before we rode away. By northern road, surely! At least their
tracks go north.”</p>

<p>“They went after us? Then they’ll see their
mistake soon…”</p>

<p>“You’ll have enough time to drink your
potion,” Oleg assured. “Would you like some more of it? You are
weak, and in this life you’ll need your strength earlier than you
expect.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at pale Chachar, put his hand
to his heart and bowed.</p>

<p>Oleg got up, took the heavy bag off the
saddle. “Three scores of well-armed warriors have been there.
Chachar did us a great turn: she saved us from this fight. We must
do the same to her.” He dropped the bag on the ground, it gave a
ringing tinkle. Thomas raised his eyebrows, then his face lit up
with a guess. Oleg untied the bag, his forearm plunged inside. “Sir
Thomas, do we number in two or three?”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” the knight replied with great
dignity, “the woman entrusted herself to our protection!”</p>

<p>“Here we have five thousands in gold. I
divide in three?”</p>

<p>“Women always need more, sir wonderer.”</p>

<p>“I know it. Who doesn’t?”</p>

<p>Chachar shifted a confused gaze between the
men. Oleg poured the coins out on the ground, fingered them apart
into three piles: one a bit larger than the rest. Thomas, with his
broadest smile, picked that pile on a big kerchief, tied the knots.
Chachar looked with embarrassment at Thomas rising up and tucking
the kerchief of gold into the saddle bag on her horse. Meanwhile,
Oleg poured the remnants into the bag they’d been in, tied it,
started to pick up the caldron and blankets. “What does it mean?”
Chachar asked.</p>

<p>“We see the city walls over there,” Oleg told
her in a sweet voice. “It’s the city we promised to take you to.
Sir Thomas and I would rather keep your company, but… you see what
a dog’s life we lead? Sleeping on the bare ground, attacked by all
the scum of these lands, as if we were smeared with honey… And
there may be even worse nights waiting ahead: spent in bogs or on
the wasp nests.”</p>

<p>Chachar shifted her indignant gaze to Thomas.
The knight nodded and turned away to his horse, lest he see her
accusing eyes. “Take your money back then!” she flared up. “Pious
bloody men! You think I rode with you for money?”</p>

<p>Oleg patted her with affection on the head.
“We have to leave. The assassins may come back here.”</p>

<p>At the fork in the road, Chachar whipped her
horse and overrode them at once. It seemed to Oleg that she jerked
her small nose up proudly only to prevent her tears from coming
out. Her back was straight, her hair fluttered in the wind. Her
horse trotted briskly, feeling the stables with other horses, fresh
oats, and a long rest in the city soon.</p>

<p>When Chachar vanished from sight, Thomas gave
out such a mighty sigh as if he had dropped a heavy boulder off, a
boulder he had carried for such a long time that he went oblivious
of it. “How fine… Sir wonderer, do you grudge the gold?”</p>

<p>“I’m a pilgrim,” Oleg reminded him. “A
wonderer. Do you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a knight errant!” Thomas replied
proudly, his back straightened up the same way as Chachar’s. “Sir
wonderer, shall we number in <emphasis>two</emphasis> all the rest of our
way?”</p>

<p>“If only you…”</p>

<p>“Never!” Thomas said fervently. “I swear it
on the cup, on my sword, on the hooves of my horse!”</p>

<p>“Even in your Christian mythology,” Oleg
pointed out, “the sin came out of Satan’s left ear and the woman
was made of a left rib, that’s why she shall go on the man’s left,
and the man’s left shoulder is seated by all the evil…”</p>

<p>“By demon,” Thomas corrected. He looked at
the wonderer with great respect. “So one shall spit over the left
shoulder… Do you Pagans spit too?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, I have to upset you. We are
turning our horses back to the south.”</p>

<p>Thomas leaned back in the saddle, as if a log
socked him between eyes. His palm clapped on the sword hilt
habitually, his face flushed angrily. “Sir wonderer…” he spoke in a
constrained voice, hardly keeping his temper. “Krizhina waits for
me!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” Oleg persisted, “I promised to
ride with you to Tsargrad… to Constantinople, I mean. <emphasis>That’s</emphasis>
why I’m ready to make a hook and over, sharing the danger with you.
It’s not <emphasis>me</emphasis> hunted. Neither me bearing the Holy Grail!”</p>

<p>“Why south?” Thomas screamed in a blaring
voice. He sounded as though in death throes. “My way lies
north!”</p>

<p>Oleg stretched his arm to point at the road.
“Straight to the north, a big party of hired robber knights with a
score of crossbowmen is coming on us. To the west, there are
assassins waiting for us. To the north-west, some strange people
lie in ambush: charms only gave me a warning but did not show how
they look… We will come back to the north. I live at the north
myself. But we’ll have to round the city and its lands in a broad
arc.”</p>

<p>Cursing like Black God, Thomas drove his
horse after the wonderer’s fast stallion.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 15</p>

<p>They galloped without rest, remounted often,
tangled their tracks, rode at nights, avoided villages and hamlets,
hid at the sight of people on the road. <emphasis>Even the most peaceful
travelers have long tongues. Those are the most dangerous weapon
now.</emphasis> Many would remember a formidable knight in gleaming armor,
with a lance in right hand and a triangle knightly shield on his
left elbow, with strange sigil: a sword and a lyre on starry field.
Oleg, in his wolfskin jack, with wooden beads on bare chest, was
memorable as well. They would also spot his bright green eyes, so
unusual in this land of dark-eyed people.</p>

<p>Once Thomas couldn’t help saying pleadingly,
“Sir wonderer, would you finger your wooden Pagan things more
often? What’s waiting for us?”</p>

<p>Oleg glanced at him slantwise with a puzzled
green eye and smirked. “But they are Pagan! Isn’t your faith
against it?”</p>

<p>Thomas fidgeted in the saddle for a while.
“When I led a party of knights across the desert, I had a Saracen
scout,” he replied with displeasure but with dignity as well. “The
information he brought was always accurate. I’d have to be a fool
to refuse his help! Faith is one thing and life is another, sir
wonderer.”</p>

<p>For a long time they rode in silence, too
tired to talk. In the evening, after their horses were unsaddled
and tethered and the two of them lay down after a sup, Thomas
asked, “And those… Secret Seven? Can they finger charms in the same
way? See us, guess our destination, know what we are doing?”</p>

<p>After a pause, Oleg told him with no
confidence, “We are completely different. They rely mostly on
accurate calculations. Civilization and progress! But in this
world, bare calculation is not enough. Neither is bare civilization
without culture.”</p>

<p>“And what enables <emphasis>you</emphasis> to see the
future?”</p>

<p>“Intuition,” Oleg replied reluctantly.
“Sometimes it fails, but in general it allows to see farther, gives
clearer and brighter images. Intuition, Sir Thomas, relies on no
knowledge but understanding. And understanding is the core element
of culture…”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing: he sniffed quietly, fast
asleep, as a dead-tired healthy man with a clear conscience. The
last thought remained in Oleg’s mind. At the damp dawn, when they
lay wrapping themselves up in blankets, he called, “Sir Thomas, are
you awake?.. Please resolve my perplexity. Why doesn’t the Holy
Grail blaze up in your hands? In my wild land, I heard this cup can
only be touched by sinless hands. But I look at you, Sir Thomas,
and wonder: do you have no sin at all? Your superstitions… your
<emphasis>commandments</emphasis>, I mean, say man is born sinful!”</p>

<p>Thomas squirmed under his blanket, waking up
and trying to get himself warm. Finally, he got out with a twitch
of shoulders, as delicate white as a woman’s. “Brrr! We have warmer
nights and <emphasis>this</emphasis> is called a hot desert!.. I think the least
sinful man is implied to be sinless. Searching for a completely
sinless one means to hang… or at least to thrash all the
mankind!”</p>

<p>“Hmm… You think the Holy Grail had been
grabbed by so many sinful hands that it lost sensitivity?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid it had, sir wonderer. It was
forced to bring its requirements down, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p>Oleg took some cold slices of meat wrapped in
wide leaves of medicinal herbs out of his bag. “Move closer. Are
you the most sinless of all Franks, including kings, emperors, and
other leaders of the Crusade?”</p>

<p>“Only Sir God is sinless!”</p>

<p>“But others are more sinful than you?”</p>

<p>“The Holy Grail thinks so,” Thomas replied
modestly. “Who I am to dispute it?”</p>

<p>They rode all the day long. By night, their
horses could barely drag their hooves along. Oleg allowed them a
whole day and night of rest. After he’d gathered the brushwood and
shot a hare, he only lay by the fire, looking dreamily in the sky.
“Do you smell the rhododendron?”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced with suspicion. “Yes, I do. I
have a nose,” he grunted but sniffed, just in case, and winced
aristocratically. “Rhodode… Ugh! I thought it was bloody Sir Ogden
again!”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with him?” Oleg
wondered.</p>

<p>“He often has indigestion. And the
smell…”</p>

<p>Oleg looked around. “Isn’t your Sir Ogden in
Britain?”</p>

<p>“The wind is from there,” Thomas dismissed
with great negligence. He tossed more twigs into the fire, then
Oleg heard a thundering sound nearby: the iron knight finally lay
down to rest. “I like to look into the fire,” he said dreamily.
“All our life is like the flames…”</p>

<p>“Why is it?” Oleg asked with interest.</p>

<p>“Why should I know?” Thomas wondered. “Am I a
philosopher?”</p>

<p>In the morning, Oleg told him they had to
ride into a village to buy some oats. Besides, they had no more
salt and bread: the last slice had been eaten two days before,
Since that, they lived on meat only.</p>

<p>The village blacksmith examined the hooves of
their horses and reshod one remount. By the way, he gave a solemn
warning, “You’d better turn until it’s too late. The way to the
right is across mountains, to the left – across deserts. For any of
them, you’ll have to leave horses. But if you barge straight
forward, it’s sure death! The land of invisible warriors there.
Evil and merciless, them allow no strangers at all. Destroy and
sacrifice any foreigner.”</p>

<p>The knight glanced askew at the bluish
mountain peaks far to his right, shivered. “I’ve crossed mountains
once. I still wake up shouting when I dream of it!”</p>

<p>“You’ve also crossed deserts,” Oleg added in
a droopy voice. “The hosts of Baldin the Third perished there: not
of foe’s sabers but of heat and thirst… What’s special about those
warriors?”</p>

<p>“Them invincible. Practice martial arts for
lifetime. Know many secrets. Should such a warrior fight ten
enemies at once, he leaves ten corpses in the field and goes
without a scratch!”</p>

<p>Oleg saw undisguised fear in the knight’s
blue eyes. “That is beyond even Sir Lancelot of the Lake… And Sir
Galahad too, and Sir Gawain even less so… My God! Why do they need
that martial skill? Are they at war?”</p>

<p>The smith shrugged. His eyes were
sympathetic. “Them took no side in Crusade. Them would only fight
each other, the strongest ones survive. Their monastery high in the
mountains… For thousands of years, its monks invented special ways
of fight.”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Monks?</emphasis>” Thomas said indignantly.
“Shouldn’t they compete in holiness?”</p>

<p>The smith cast a sharp glance, mocking and
sympathetic at once, at the knight. “Our faith is young, theirs
old. Them have own rites. Them do no plowing, no reaping, no sowing
– only jump and scream with arms. From dawn till dark.”</p>

<p>Thomas shuddered. “This is the way to train a
hare to defeat a wolf. Every day from dawn till dark, year after
year… Brrr!.. And the desert… how broad is it?”</p>

<p>“Just a week journey. On fast camels.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced slantwise at their exhausted
horses. “Which way would we take, sir wonderer?” he asked
hopefully. “What do your gods tell you?”</p>

<p>“And yours?”</p>

<p>“Mine… high and inspired they are! They set
the world going. And yours are simpler. They have better knowledge
of mundane life.”</p>

<p>“Our gods teach us to take straight roads. I
don’t think Christ would object to it either. Let’s strengthen our
souls and ride straight!”</p>

<p>Thomas’s face darkened, he fell silent for a
long time. Finally, he put his palm down on the bag where a side of
the cup was shown through. “You are right, sir,” he told Oleg with
a heavy sigh. “We should pick straight ways, and the Holy Virgin
will not leave us till our death hour!”</p>

<p>They spent a night at the hospitable smith’s
place, rode out on the road at dawn. Thomas frowned, checked the
easiness of drawing the sword out more frequently than he did
usually, flinched at every rustle. Oleg hung the quiver with arrows
on his back, though in the hot air it started to sore straight
away, nasty trickles of sweat ran down to his waist. He kept the
bow string on. Thomas needed no words to understand that the
wonderer was anxious and alerted. “We’ll cope,” Thomas said in a
loud but shaky voice. “The Holy Virgin never leaves her faithful
knights!”</p>

<p>The wonderer hemmed. “I wanted to ask you
this question long ago…” he said loudly. “Why do you swear on the
Virgin? I thought your main gods are Christ and his Father whose
name I forgot, and the Holy Spirit whose name I can’t recall either
– followed by Nicholas, Michael, Gabriel, George… And the Holy
Virgin – what sort of patron can she make? A young woman with a
babe in arms!”</p>

<p>Thomas shot a fiery glance at him, snuffled.
“Men can defend themselves, and Virgin Mary has a need of
defenders! That’s why we, noble knights, are the warriors of
hers!”</p>

<p>“Er… Is it <emphasis>you</emphasis> protecting her?”</p>

<p>Thomas winced. Usually, he would avoid
discussing divine matters with that Pagan, but now, being put in a
spot, he decided to counterattack. “And why do your Slavs who
turned into the faith of Christ swear on some Saint Nicholas? He’s
no main god either! Your Slavic princes, I’ve seen many of them in
the Crusade, had Saint Nicholas, not Christ on their banners! And
I’ve heard Slavic warriors talking that when the God of Christians
dies their Saint Nicholas will take his throne! What did they
mean?”</p>

<p>Oleg shrugged. “I don’t know. I’m the
sorcerer of Old Faith.”</p>

<p>“A Pagan!”</p>

<p>“An Old Believer,” Oleg corrected. “A
Rodian!”</p>

<p>“The new always wins! No way to stop it.”</p>

<p>“The old is replaced by new, according to
Rod’s decree, every six hundred years. Six centuries after Rod was
born, the White God came into this world, followed, after six more
centuries, by Targitai, then by Zarathustra, then by Gautama also
known as Buddha, just in case you didn’t know… Six centuries after
Buddha, your Christ was born. But he’s not the last one! Six
centuries after him, a new prophet came into the
world.”<sup>12</sup></p>

<p>Thomas recoiled, spat with disgust. “He’s no
prophet to me.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Everything was said by Jesus. Nothing to be
added.”</p>

<p>“Really? I kindly advise you to read Koran
before you argue on it. <emphasis>If</emphasis> the new is always the better,
then you should adopt the faith of Mahomet without reading Koran at
all. And if it isn’t, then you shouldn’t attack Old Believers. Even
less so, as you are Angle! I’ve spotted that Saxes and Angles
revere their ancestors and traditions. You have so much love for
antiquity that after you’ve destroyed the ancient Britons, you keep
calling the captured land Britain!”</p>

<p>“Not all of us,” Thomas replied with
displeasure. “Some fools try to call it Saxony… Though this way it
gets confused with the old Saxony where we once came from. Also, it
is called Anglo-Saxony…”</p>

<p>“Maybe you should call it just Anglia?”</p>

<p>“It would be unfair,” Thomas objected but
smiled contentedly. “Saxons had landed on this new island too, and
their number was not smaller than ours.”</p>

<p>“What did you see to be fair?” Oleg wondered.
“Scythians perished a thousand years ago but we are still called
Scythes! And our Slavic lands are named Great Scythia!”</p>

<p>The next day, their road came to the bank of
a broad river. They saw some boats, both fisher and merchant ones,
far away but the crowd on the wide log mooring was waiting for a
ferry, which, enormous and slow, was crawling along the cable from
the other bank.</p>

<p>Thomas looked across the river with glassy
eyes. Far away there, almost at the horizon, the yellow walls of a
strange fortress could be seen, well-lit by the morning sun. Oleg
nudged a small hook-nosed man who looked like a gaunt mournful
bird. “Whose castle is it?”</p>

<p>The man gave him a strange look, moved away
carefully. His neighbor, swarthy and hook-nosed the same, cast an
apprehensive glance around. “I see you are Frank,” he said in a
warning tone. “Mind you not say that in presence of monks. It’s no
castle but holy monastery! A cloister to warrior monks.”</p>

<p>“A cloister? Do they come out of it?”</p>

<p>“Their duty is to wander by roads and preach
good. And since most roads are dangerous, monks are taught to fight
so that any of them can defeat ten villains armed to their teeth!
With his bare hands, surely.”</p>

<p>“And if… not bare?”</p>

<p>The hook-nosed man shook his head. “Armed?..
Well, only gods may withstand then! Or they may not…”</p>

<p>The ferry crept up to the mooring, pushed
against it with iron-bound logs: the travelers felt a quiver
beneath their feet. Two ferryman jumped on the mooring, tied sturdy
ropes, threw a wide wooden gangplank across. The crowd began to
flow onto the ferry.</p>

<p>A sullen ferryman was leaning on the rope to
have some rest. He gave a surprised look to Oleg and the knight in
gleaming armor, as they led their horses upon the wooden planks of
the ferry. “Franks? Where to? Monks don’t like strangers.”</p>

<p>Thomas gulped down, his voice suddenly got
hoarse. “We only need a passage across these lands! We have own
food and oats. We won’t offend or disturb anyone. We are no
enemies!”</p>

<p>The ferryman spat into the yellow water
bursting noisily from beneath the ferry, turned away. “If you tired
of wearing your heads…”</p>

<p>Some carts had their wheels coupled on the
gangplank. The ferryman bellowed, his helpers dashed there with
raised poles, thrashed both horses and their masters. Soon the
matter was settled down, the carts pulled apart and placed
properly.</p>

<p>Several scores of hands seized the rope,
helping to move the ferry. Thomas and Oleg stood aside with their
horses. From time to time, Thomas felt the cup through the bag and
shot suspicious glances around.</p>

<p>The river lapped on the ferry, spraying it
with water. Thomas pulled a long face, his eyes turned scared. Oleg
followed his eyes to a poorly clad villager. “I saw myself,” he
told other men, waving his hands. “Them tried stop him on road,
with spear heads advanced, sharp an’ gleaming. He tore shirt in
rage, barged on them with bare chest! An’ them set spears on him,
one on his very throat, but no scratch on him! He went an’ thought
o’ the High, and spears bent…”</p>

<p>“Five?” one of the listeners asked with a
flash of interest. “I saw three of ‘em bend.”</p>

<p>“All five of ‘em!” the storyteller swore it
with such pride as if it were <emphasis>his</emphasis> chest blunting the
needle-sharp spearheads. “But them brave, seasoned warriors! No one
dropped spear until it bent like yoke… an’ pulled out sharp swords!
But what sword against a monk martial art?” His listeners shrugged.
Thomas’s face was going more and more miserable. “He laid all five
of ‘em. Faster than one of us claps hands!”</p>

<p>Oleg saw Thomas moving his iron palms apart
and together quickly. The knight went pallid, with dark circles
under his eyes. He was fingering the cup anxiously through the
thick leather of the bag.</p>

<p>“All five of ‘em dead,” the storyteller
specified. “Each at just one touch!” The rest nodded silently,
their thoughts written clearly on their faces. <emphasis>It’s clear he
only hit once, that’s how the masters of fisticuffs do. Who would
bother a second strike if the first one is enough to send anyone
flying into the dust, with their necks and spines broken?</emphasis></p>

<p>The gloomy bank was approaching fast. The men
started to stir, to elbow their way to the border, striving to be
the first walker off. The ferryman’s helpers pushed them away,
swearing. The ferry hit heavily against the thick logs. The two
lads jumped on the mooring, fastened the ropes quickly to fix the
ferry, covered the slit with the trampled gangplank. The crowd
streamed ashore after them: hurrying, elbowing, pushing the
ferrymen aside.</p>

<p>Oleg and Thomas waited until everyone,
including the carts, got off the ferry, then led their horses onto
the wooden mooring, mounted with an air of doom. The crowd broke
apart, heading to the left and to the right – and they drove their
horses straight ahead, where the yellow-walled cloister of warrior
monks could be seen over distant hills.</p>

<p>On the way, they met strange oxcarts: with
huge wheels, higher than their wooden sides, loaded with firewood
and hays of fragrant stack, pulled by strange furry bulls, which
were called <emphasis>yaks</emphasis> there. The villagers, dozy on the stacks,
glanced at the knight in his gleaming steel with slack interest and
gave the tanned barbarian in his wolfskin jack only a brief
once-over: everyone had own business to mind, and the knight and
the barbarian rode without a stop, severe and frowning.</p>

<p>At the road turn, Thomas reined up. The walls
of the monastery towered in half a mile ahead. Some green branches
and bunches of grass were dried on its flat roofs. The road went
past the gate. <emphasis>No way to turn off: a scatter of stones on the
right will break the legs of horses. On the left, there’s a crop
field, but we are not in Britain to ride across a field that
belongs to others.</emphasis></p>

<p>Over the monastery roofs, yellow banners with
grinning dragons, lions, and tigers quivered at the light breeze. A
two-wheeled oxcart rolled through the distant gate, the drowsy
driver urging his slow-paced yaks on. The gate was flanked by men
in long orange robes. They stood motionless, their clean-shaven
heads gleaming at the sunshine.</p>

<p>Oleg made a move to ride on, but Thomas
stopped him with his arm stretched. “Just look what they do!”</p>

<p>From the top of the hill where they stood,
they had a good view of the green field behind the monastery wall.
Three scores of men in the same clothing jumped, somersaulted,
brandished long poles. The tall wall around prevented any stranger
from spotting their fighting ways from a close distance. and from
the hill, one could barely make out their tiny figures. A monk,
definitely one of those great warriors of whom that man on the
ferry spoke with terror and awe, jumped up to a stout tree, started
thrashing it with his bare hands. Pieces of bark flew sideways.</p>

<p>Thomas breathed out with a heavy groan, his
stallion trotted down along the road sadly. Oleg moved his
shoulders to adjust the quiver. Thomas rode with no look back,
straightened and staring ahead. The monastery approached slowly.
Its walls kept being seen as a whole, instead of breaking apart
into huge stone slabs, and Oleg realized they were made of yellow
clay mixed with straw.</p>

<p>Their horses were in half a hundred steps
from the gate when a score and a half of men came out of it to
block their way: all shave-headed, in the same orange robes, all
sturdy, lean, and muscular. All the monks were much smaller than
Oleg and Thomas but sinewy, and their posture and accurate moves
could only belong to skilled fighters.</p>

<p>The monk who stood in the middle raised his
hand imperatively. Thomas and Oleg pulled up. Thomas checked
anxiously whether the sword hilt was in place, his fingers
tightened their grip on the lance, his left elbow with a shield on
it moved slightly to cover half of his breast.</p>

<p>“Stop!” the senior monk cried in a thin,
clear voice, which would have sounded childish if not the ringing
of metal in it. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas Malton of Gisland,” Thomas
replied, trying to keep his voice firm. “Coming home after the
triumphant conquer of the Holy Land. This is Oleg, a peaceful
pilgrim. He comes from the land of Hyperborean, also known as the
Great Scythia.”</p>

<p>“Why are you crossing our lands?”</p>

<p>“It’s the shortest way,” Thomas explained. He
cast a warning look at the wonderer. “The host marched around your
country in a wide arc, but we know that no harm is to come from two
peaceful riders!”</p>

<p>The senior monk watched them suspiciously.
“Peaceful? Why do you have a lance and a long sword then? And your
companion, a <emphasis>peaceful</emphasis> pilgrim, has a battle bow and
arrows!”</p>

<p>“The roads are dangerous. Villains, robbers,
night murderers…”</p>

<p>The monk glanced back at his silent
companions. “If you tried to cross our lands without arms, you’d
have a chance. Though a little one… We tolerate no strangers. And
kill they who come armed.” He sounded stern and dooming. Other
monks did not stir, but their muscles bulged and stiffened. “You’ll
have to fight!” the senior monk said with a malevolent smirk.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back at the silent wonderer.
“We’d rather not fight…” the knight begged. His voice gave a
quaver.</p>

<p>Ghosts of smiles appeared on the still faces
of monks. “If you win – ride on!” the senior said coldly. “If you
lose…” His slanting eyes glittered coldly, his face remained
stony.</p>

<p>A sturdy, sinewy monk stepped out of the
line. He joined his palms by his breast, made a low bow. Thomas
tilted his lance slightly: every man of civilization should respond
to a greeting, and a man of culture all the more. Oleg pressed his
palm against his heart in reply, bowed his head.</p>

<p>The monk made a swift move with arms, took a
strange fighting stance.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />
</section>

<section>
<p>Chapter 16</p>

<p>“He calls for fisticuffs!” Oleg realized. He
started to dismount reluctantly, groaning.</p>

<p>“May I do it?” Thomas suggested, with a
quaver in his voice.</p>

<p>“You need half a day to take your steel off.”
Oleg dropped the reins on the saddle, spat loudly on his palms,
took his stand against the fighter. While high in the saddle, he
had spotted something strange about the whole line of shavepates.
Now that he dismounted, he grasped that the sinewy monk’s head,
with his face of a skillful and ruthless fist fighter, was on a
level with his breast. The monk’s thin arms with tiny fists looked
like switches.</p>

<p>With a terrible shriek, the monk dashed
forward. Oleg stepped back involuntarily under the hail of his
blows, shielded with arms in fright: it was like being attacked by
a furious she-cat in a dark barn, as he once was when he’d bothered
her kittens. He heard guttural cries of monks, then Thomas yelling.
Oleg waved away once and again, each time hitting the thin air. The
yellow robe flickered before his eyes, then he felt a hard blow on
lips, pain and salty taste in the mouth. He roared with fury, his
fists began to move faster, but he missed every time, punching the
air, while the monk wriggled around like a loach, showering him
with swift frequent blows from all sides. Oleg stopped backing,
stood in place for a while, his fists darted forward menacingly, as
he targeted the monk’s concentrated face that glistened with big
beads of sweat.</p>

<p>Suddenly the monk flew up, gave out such a
terrible shriek as if he got under a loaded oxcart, and hit Oleg’s
breast with both feet. Oleg lurched, made a step back to keep his
balance, waved his hand and gripped the falling monk by ankle. The
adversary had bent, ready to somersault, but now, being caught by
leg, he struck against the ground forcefully with his face, choked
with nasty fine dust.</p>

<p>Oleg still held the foe’s ankle, guessing
what to do now, when the monk thrashed in his arms, hit his breast
with the other heel and squeaked with pain, then hit lower but the
wonderer’s belly was not much softer, so the monk squeaked again,
arched his back like a cat, gripped Oleg’s hand with both of his,
digging his nails deep into flesh. Oleg’s fingers unclenched
hurriedly, jerked his hand away. The monk fell down but jumped up
at once, as if his bottom were pierced with an awl. Standing with
his back to Oleg, he started raising his leg for a sider, but Oleg
got cross and kicked him forcefully below his back.</p>

<p>The monk was sent flying. He collapsed into
the dust in several steps and remained there, sprawled like a frog
squashed by a wheel. “He shouldn’t have scratched me!” Oleg said
loudly, as an excuse for himself. “He could bite me either… Though
I’d have knocked all his teeth out then!”</p>

<p>Thomas looked at Oleg with goggled eyes. The
senior monk came out of stupor and whispered – not bellowed! – a
few words. Two monks dashed to their fallen comrade. Oleg watched,
with compassion and concern, the injured man to be turned on his
back. His arms were pulled apart, the air was blown into his mouth.
At last, one of the monks cried something in a high-pitched,
bird-like voice, the senior monk cast a sharp glance at Oleg, and
the defeated fighter was carried at a run into the open gate.</p>

<p>Two monks, whose solemn faces seemed to be
carved of dark stone, stepped forward. One winced malevolently,
shot a fierce glance at Oleg. Another gave a terrible scream and
shivered, as if in some dashing dance, his face contorted, sinews
in his neck bulged like a spinal comb of a big lizard. The senior
monk looked them over approvingly. “Which would you like?” he asked
Oleg harshly.</p>

<p>“To fight, you mean?”</p>

<p>“To combat.”</p>

<p>“Well, to make it fair… Both.”</p>

<p>The senior monk’s eyebrows jerked up. “The
two of them?” he repeated slowly, unable to believe his ears. “At
the same time?”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?” Oleg wondered in turn. “If no
mortal combat, why not to have some fun? When I was young, we
fought face-offs in groups…”</p>

<p>The monks started coming to him from both
sides. Oleg stepped away from one, but missed the stroke of another
who flew up like a hellish bat, bared his teeth, raised his hand
but struck with <emphasis>foot</emphasis>: so high that the bare heel hit Oleg’s
head. Oleg spat with vexation for being tricked like that. He moved
to grip his ankle, as he did with the previous combatant, but
failed. Meanwhile, the first monk took a running jump from the
left. The violent kick of both his feet on the neck almost knocked
Oleg down. He turned, raising his fist for a mighty blow, but both
monks whisked under his arms and began to pound his back with
fists, elbows, feet, even heads. Once Oleg wheeled round, like
angered bear, both warrior monks slipped to behind him again,
knocked on his back like on a wall of logs, screaming in
high-pitched voices, hitting with their heads. <emphasis>At least they
neither bite nor scratch.</emphasis></p>

<p>After a fifth or sixth attempt, Oleg managed
to snatch one of them blindly. It turned out to be his head, so
Oleg took care not to squeeze it, got a better grip on his leg,
whirled the monk overhead and rushed after the other one. The
adversary ran away from him in circles, screaming desperately. Oleg
chased him as if he were a naughty kitten, brandishing the first
warrior monk overhead, roaring with joy.</p>

<p>Finally, the fighter stumbled, fell into the
dust, shielded his head with both arms in wild fear, then pulled
the hem of his robe over. “I see you give up,” Oleg understood. He
took his “weapon” with both hands and laid him down on a dusty road
near his brother. “Live on, lad!”</p>

<p>The monk whom Oleg intended to use as a club,
though landed no blow with him, lay with his eyes goggled as a
lobster’s. His face and neck were horrible crimson, filled with bad
blood. The veins on his temples bulged in tight branchy knots.</p>

<p>The monks were backing in horror. Their even
line broke, their goggle-eyed gazes shifted between their sprawled
brothers and the smirking giant barbarian. The senior monk glanced
back at his monastery walls in confusion, as if he expected some
help from there. “Give me two more of yours!” Oleg suggested. “Or
come with them yourself. I’ve only started to warm up. We Slavs are
a nation of north, we harness slowly… It’s been ages since I romped
in fisticuffs. I see no harm in pleasing myself and our gods with
them!”</p>

<p>The senior monk glanced at Oleg and Thomas
angrily, spat out few words in a high-pitched voice, like a street
fishwife. One of the monks darted into the gate, the sprawled
brothers were carried after him. Behind the wall, there were shouts
and horse neighs.</p>

<p>Three warriors, in yellow jackets and strange
straw hats, which looked like caps of mushrooms, with red tassels,
ran out of the gate briskly. Each had a short spear in clenched
fist and a thin curved saber on his belt.</p>

<p>“Serious guys,” Oleg admitted. He backed to
his horse, where his bow and quiver lay across the saddle and his
giant sword hung beside it.</p>

<p>Thomas drove his horse ahead, blocking the
way. “Sir wonderer,” he said solemnly, “it’s a shame for me to hide
behind a peaceful back of a holy hermit. I’m a noble knight after
all, a professional fighter for justice. Please let <emphasis>me</emphasis> warm
up now. You need time to take your sword, and I have mine in
hand!”</p>

<p>Thomas dismounted heavily, walked ahead
slowly, stopped before the three warrior monks. He looked like a
glittering tower of metal, his armor gleaming so bright that it was
painful to look at. Slowly, Thomas lowered his visor, unsheathed
the sword. The sunlight scattered blue sparkles over the
double-edged blade of Damask steel.</p>

<p>The senior monk backed, with his head tossed
and mouth open. At last, he came to his senses, spoke in a shaky
voice, “Which of my warriors will you fight, Frank?”</p>

<p>Thomas had spotted the weakest, in his view,
one among them but looked back at Oleg, suppressed a sigh of grief
and replied as haughtily as he could, “Would I, Sir Thomas Malton
of Gisland, select one when my humble friend, who wouldn’t harm a
fly, did fight <emphasis>two</emphasis>? Surely, I’ll fight all three.”</p>

<p>The senior monk wheeled round to the three
warriors of his. They breathed fast, their arms quivered with
strain. In that silence, one could all but hear the creak of their
extremely tensed muscle. The three of them had their eyes fixed on
the gleaming knight, the heads of their spears aimed at his
breast.</p>

<p>Thomas looked back at his huge warhorse. His
giant lance, as thick as a young tree, remained across the saddle,
but he only waved his hand. “Dear sirs! I beg you to start with the
arms we have. My lance is more fitting for a knightly joust.”</p>

<p>The senior monk uttered a desperate shriek,
the three brave fighters rushed forward. Thomas had barely
tightened his grip on the sword hilt when three spears hit his
chest. He felt a violent push, white wooden chips flew up before
his eyes. One of the warrior monks who came running hit the
knight’s steel breast with own head. He gasped, fell down to
Thomas’s feet. The rest two staggered away, their eyes malevolent
and confused. The ground before the knight was strewn by splinters
of broken spears. One of the monks was shaking his blooded
hand.</p>

<p>Thomas stooped, slapped the unconscious monk
sympathetically on the back of his head. “Dear sir! Get up, it’s
all over.”</p>

<p>“A well-nursed child utters no scream!” Oleg
cried out. “Don’t hit on head! You have your gauntlet on, and his
head is as large as mine… er… fist.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t hit,” Thomas muttered in fright and
took his hand away hastily. “I patted him, for Christ wanted us to
love even our foes… And this one’s no foe indeed. Dear sir herald!
Please call new fighters. These ones got tired, I see.”</p>

<p>The senior monk screeched in despair, tore
his hat off, trampled on it fiercely, as if it were a jumping
viper. His goggled eyes looked like owl’s, then they got bloodshot.
His thin lips dropped foam. He kept glancing back at the gate
impatiently. His face lit up when three more warriors ran out.</p>

<p>With spears at the ready and such terrible
screams as if some parts of them were pinched in the door, they
dashed on Thomas, their legs moved swiftly. The knight gripped his
sword – and was late again. A spear hit him straight in the face,
hooked his visor, two others broke on his chest. The triple blow
was so crushing that Thomas couldn’t help reeling back. He even
made a small step back but, as his frightened glance fell on the
wonderer who watched the fight very closely, Thomas stepped forward
with haste.</p>

<p>Two monks were staggering back, their hands
pressed to their smashed, bleeding faces. The third one lay at
Thomas’s feet: his arms spread out wide, his squashed nose and
slashed eyebrow bleeding heavily.</p>

<p>Groaning with vexation, Thomas pulled out the
spearhead stuck in the visor, twisted it about in his steel
fingers, with disgust for the low quality of iron, and flung away.
“These tired too,” he spoke loudly to no one in particular. “Can’t
fight but fall asleep, like fish ashore.”</p>

<p>“Too nimble they are, like mice!” Oleg said
with concern. “And you only gape your jaws, scratch yourself, and
keep harnessing… Are you a Slav<sup>13</sup>? Fight, or they’ll smash
their heads before you get ready, stuffed iron dummy!”</p>

<p>“Before I get ready?” Thomas got surprised.
He looked around nervously. “I am ready! I’m shaking in my shoes as
I wait for them to start using their martial arts… And all I get is
their pre-fight rites!”</p>

<p>“Which rites?” Oleg didn’t get it.</p>

<p>“Pre-fight,” Thomas said again. “The ones
before fight. Breaking their twigs, hitting their foreheads… I’m
tired of trembling and waiting for their famous fighters to show
up!”</p>

<p>The men with small wounds were taken by arms
and led away, the motionless one carried after them. A new score of
warrior monks ran out, armed with poles, spears, and sabers. Some
even had strange flails: the likes of those were used in Russian
villages to thresh the sheaves of wheat. The monks stopped at the
gate, talking to each other in shrill chirping voices. <emphasis>Like a
big flock of small forest birds</emphasis>, Oleg thought. One was sent by
senior monk back to the monastery. <emphasis>Seems he was told to deliver
a message and be back in a flash.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg came to his horse, pulled the sword out,
turned his face to the monks. Thomas stood in two steps, casting
jealous glances, as he compared the length of their weapons. The
wonderer’s sword did not look shorter, though Thomas’s one was the
longest in all the crusader army. Moreover, Oleg’s sword was
obviously heavier, as its blade was half as broad again as
Thomas’s. The senior monk, as the knight had spotted, couldn’t take
his eyes off the wonderer’s blade sparkling with bluish lights.
However, he gazed at Thomas’s huge sword, as long as any of monkish
spears, in the same way. <emphasis>Like a rabbit enchanted by a
cobra.</emphasis></p>

<p>That time no one came running out of the
gate, screaming, jumping, and swaying a thin rite spear in
complicated ways. They heard a bass gong in the monastery. A very
old monk appeared in the gate, clad in a sumptuous oriental robe
embroidered with gold and a multistoried hat with little bells and
ribbons. The staff in his hand was decorated with silver, its knob
was shaped as a head of furious dragon.</p>

<p>“That must be a senior sorcerer,” Thomas said
quietly.</p>

<p>“An abbot,” Oleg objected in whisper. “Or
even a bishop!”</p>

<p>Thomas snuffled indignantly but, out of
respect, said nothing. The local sorcerer (or bishop) looked the
battlefield over from beneath his senile swollen eyelids, advanced
his trembling hands. Monks came running from both sides to support
his stretched arms respectfully.</p>

<p>“Who are you, strangers?” the dressed-up
sorcerer or bishop (or maybe an abbot) asked.</p>

<p>“Pilgrims,” Thomas replied respectfully. “We
ride in no hurry from the Holy Land, bother and offend no one… You
see, the monks of your monastery have greeted us by a strange rite,
but even sir wonderer, though a Pagan, knows: when in monastery, do
as monks do. In some places a guest must wipe his feet, while in
others he must not…”</p>

<p>“I’m a preceptor of this famous monastery,”
the old man said in a rasping voice. “Here we study the martial art
of <emphasis>mao shui</emphasis>, the best in the world. We revere great heroes,
even the wandering ones, and invite you to honor the ancient walls
of our wonderful monastery that has the only true rules with your
visit.”</p>

<p>“Well… we are not quite great heroes,” Thomas
mumbled with a stunned look.</p>

<p>Oleg slapped loudly on the knight’s metal
shoulder. “Let’s go, or no seed will remain of these men. They lay
themselves out just to show their hospitality!”</p>

<p>On an open porch, there was a table of
polished walnut set for them and mats to sit on. Oleg managed to
seat himself, with his legs crossed in the way he had learnt from
Saracen (though it made his joints crunch as snow), while poor
Thomas tried to settle himself this way and that and ended pulling
his breastplate off fiercely. His body was warmed, Oleg smelled at
once that the noble knight hadn’t washed it for a long time. Thomas
sat down on his iron armor, put his glittering helmet on the floor
besides. His hair, the color of reap wheat, poured over his
shoulders, lighting the walls with golden shine.</p>

<p>Glancing at each other across the table, they
snatched quails roasted in dried white breadcrumbs and stuffed with
nuts and lard. The birds were so juicy and tender that Thomas
gobbled them down with bones. The peacocks, partridges, and
starlings cooked skillfully on spits were even more tender, and
those baked on griddles were just melting in the mouth. Thomas
barely had time to squeeze big walnuts and small hazelnuts in his
strong teeth before they were served a new course on huge plates:
ham seasoned with Eastern spices, set densely with whole nuts,
sprinkled with crumbled nuts and shredded fragrant grass.</p>

<p>A large plate with a pile of smoked sausages
was placed in front of Oleg. They were so thin and red that he
mistook them for earthworms and moved the plate away with disgust.
Thomas seized it at once with both hands, dragged closer. He must
have known this course, as he had lived among Saracens, or guessed
it.</p>

<p>However, Thomas was the first to get full. He
loosened his belt, started to pant, and ended leaning back from the
table and looking with envy at the wonderer who, staying perfectly
calm, gulped down lots of roast birds, baked fish seasoned with a
sour sauce, fine shreds of young venison sinking in big juicy
berries, then fruits, berries, and meat again: roast, baked, dried,
and smoked… Finally, Thomas couldn’t help saying venomously,
“Hermits feed on honey and locusts! And you, valiant sir wonderer,
are eating up the second boar!”</p>

<p>“When in monastery, do as monks do. You said
it. So eat what you are given, don’t be squeamish.”</p>

<p>“Would you have preferred locusts?”</p>

<p>“With honey,” Oleg reminded modestly. “But
now I’m out of small reclusion, did you forget? And in the Great
Reclusion, I lead the same life as others. No standing out, no
excelling.”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing but his blue eyes spoke
out clearly how non-excelling the wonderer was while setting to the
third boar, washing it down with falls of heady drinks and barley
beer, eating lots of boiled crabs after, guzzling jugs of red wine
dry. Without batting an eyelid, he gobbled fat spotted snakes and
frogs and jelly-like oysters, which Thomas was afraid even to look
at: his face went green and his body spotty, making him look like
those frogs and pythons.</p>

<p>Down in the yard, monks were training
tirelessly. Young and old men, all in the same orange robes,
jumped, somersaulted, fought with poles and wooden swords. Oleg
feasted his eyes upon a separate group who swung wooden flails. He
had often seen village boys fighting with flails, but the monks did
wonders with those. <emphasis>Their flails are much lighter and shorter,
however, but one should mind they are small people. These fellows
might fail even to raise a Slavic flail, but brandish easily the
lighter ones of theirs, called</emphasis> <strong><emphasis>nunchaku</emphasis></strong><emphasis>,
shift them between hands swiftly, whirl over heads…</emphasis></p>

<p>In the far corner of the garden, the
strongest monks (or the most skillful ones, Oleg and Thomas did not
know exactly) had their practice. Anyway, there was a crowd of
gapers around: gasping, squeaking, crouching with awe. One of the
skillful (or strong) would break two boulders, one topped on
another, with the edge of his palm, the second – a thick stick with
a terrible blow of his fist, and the third, with his muscle bulging
fiercely, would tie an iron rod, as thick as a rake, in a bundle.
After he had a rest, he would bend or tie the next one.</p>

<p>“Monks?” Thomas said with disapproval. “They
are Pagans who haven’t seen the light of Christ!”</p>

<p>Oleg chopped off a weighty slice of juicy
fragrant brisket, salted it, peppered, spiced with mustard,
sprinkled nicely with ground roots and shedders of greenery. “But
they know good food instead. There are many ways to gods. The way
of these robed men is exercise. It’s the same as fast is for you
Christians. Fast is the triumph of spirit over base flesh, isn’t
it? Here, the same high spirit makes men exercise until they fall
like dead. They live in <emphasis>monkhood</emphasis>: no women, no dancing, no
wine! They only have exercise instead of praying. And on different
ways of serving gods…”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>God</emphasis>,” Thomas corrected with
displeasure. “He is single!”</p>

<p>“And angels. archangels, cherubs, seraphs,
and so on – aren’t they some smaller gods? Well, I just meant that
people on different ways need different food.”</p>

<p>Thomas could not take his eyes off the green
garden full of cries, squeals, dry thuds of wooden poles. “Let’s go
and have a look?.. I don’t understand many things here.”</p>

<p>“Just many?” Oleg was surprised. “Happy you!”
He wiped his mouth with a sleeve, cast a regretful look over the
table to which silent monks kept serving food and drinks
noiselessly from all around. <emphasis>As befits a hermit who exercised in
hunger for years.</emphasis> Thomas was already up his feet, pulling on
the breastplate: he made no step without it and neither went to
sleep. He also put on the helmet, though visor remained up, and
glanced back warily at the huge sword: its polished handle
glittered ominously in the corner, together with Oleg’s sword. “We
are guests!” the wonderer whispered softly to him. “I don’t think
they’ll break the law of hospitality.”</p>

<p>“Laws are different in different lands.”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>This</emphasis> one is common.”</p>

<p>“Even for the guests who broke into?”</p>

<p>Oleg said nothing: he also started to think
that fearless monks could not be willing to invite two strangers
into their impregnable monastery. His fingers slid reassuringly by
the knife hilts on the inner side of his jack.</p>

<p>Thomas saw it. “You shouldn’t have left the
bow,” he grumbled.</p>

<p>“It would look strange.”</p>

<p>“You could say that’s a part of your costume.
A ritual ornament! Once I’ve rode past a savage tribe whose leader
ornamented himself with spoons, tin cups, and pans. Can’t recall
the name of that country: it might have been either Rus’ or
Ethiopia…”</p>

<p>As they approached the garden, the cracks,
thuds, and battle cries grew louder. Down at the last stair, the
prior sat on a small bench. A sullen monk, strong in shoulders,
stood motionless behind him. Both had beautiful staffs in hands:
gilded, gleaming, decorated with elaborate carving, little bells,
bright feathers. Both kept their eyes on the excercising monks.
Sometimes the standing monk would cry out a command, and the ones
in the garden would speed up at once. Both observers glanced back
in fright, as they heard the metallic thunder of Thomas’s steps.
The monk helped the old man up his feet, both bowed to their guests
from the waist.</p>

<p>The knight bowed in return with effort, as
Oleg did. The small of Thomas’s back grinded. The monks gave a new,
even more polite bow. Thomas and Oleg replied with the same. Oleg
heard a squeezed protesting sob in his stomach. “Strange rites can
be a burden!” Thomas said through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>“Not for everyone,” Oleg replied, but looked
with compassion at the iron plates on the small of knight’s back,
as they came over each other, rasping, rubbing the rust away.</p>

<p>“Who knows how much bows remain,” Thomas
whispered. “Which is their sacred number?”</p>

<p>“It’s often three,” Oleg replied after
thinking for a while. “Three epic heroes, three heads of a dragon,
three sons… But, on the other hand, a house has <emphasis>four</emphasis>
corners, a horse has four legs… er… to stumble. The Secret Seven
vowed to raise their <emphasis>five</emphasis>-pointed star over all the world,
to put it even on the towers of our Moscow Kremlin<sup>14</sup>…
and David, whose tower you took by storm, had a star of <emphasis>six</emphasis>
points. But <emphasis>seven</emphasis> is considered a magic number in all the
world, since the times of Chaldean and Urjupin…”</p>

<p>Thomas groaned, straightened up with effort
and stopped bowing. The prior and the monk also stiffened in a
polite half-bow. “We sent the fastest rider for Libryuk and
Chaknor,” the old man said in a rasping voice. “They are the
greatest warriors of our land. They’ll come at night, so next
morning you’ll have an opportunity to fight them!”</p>

<p>Thomas froze as if he got ice-bound. Oleg
gulped down a lump in his throat. “One thing on top…” he said
politely. “Why two of them? One would do. The good sire dreams of
battles, jousts, and combats. There’s nothing, even your bread and
wine, he likes more than fighting!”</p>

<p>“And you, a great hero of Hyperborean?” the
monastic elder asked warily.</p>

<p>“I live up to other monastic rules. Good meal
and good sleep, that’s all I need.”</p>

<p>“A very interesting monastery,” the prior
said thoughtfully. “I’d like to go there on pilgrimage.”</p>

<p>Thomas stepped down from the stone stairs,
strolled across the garden. He left a trace of deep footprints,
like a walking iron statue. The excercising monks started to glance
back. A stir spread upon their rows until all of them stopped,
stiffened with respectful attention, then started bowing
altogether. Thomas sniffed with displeasure, bowed his head with a
great effort, his armor gave a rasp. The local strongmen gave an
even lower bow eagerly. Thomas grasped there would be no end to
that and pretended to see nothing. He turned to the stairs where
the prior and his assistant remained. “Is it really difficult?”</p>

<p>The monastic elder got up with the monk’s
help, crossed the garden slowly and poignantly. He stopped in two
steps from Thomas and ringed out, “Would you break the brick? To do
it, one needs to please our gods. Besides, our fighters exercise in
it from dawn till dusk! A year after year…”</p>

<p>Thoughtful, Thomas turned to the group of
fighters. They stood with their sleeves rolled up to elbows, all
sweaty and powdered with the red dust of crushed boulders. A red
pile of bricks was seen aside, and one boulder lay prepared on a
huge granite block that had sank by a third into the ground under
own weight.</p>

<p>Thomas tapped on the boulder with a finger,
heard a dry ringing sound. He looked around, as though expecting a
catch in it, his eyes full of fear and agonizing hesitation. One of
the monks caught his sight, put one more red stone eagerly on the
top of the boulder. Thomas bowed his head slowly and bent a finger.
The monk raised his eyebrows but added the third boulder
obediently. Thomas thought for a while, ordered by gesture to lay
one more. The monk hesitated, looked around those present. His eyes
were astonished and frightened, but he put a stone on and retreated
hastily into the crowd.</p>

<p>Oleg walked around the granite block,
examined the pile of stones thoroughly, slid his finger over the
red crumbs. “Want to break it?”</p>

<p>“Well, it’s important to them for some
reason…”</p>

<p>“Do it,” Oleg approved. “The thing is not
ours to take care of.”</p>

<p>Thomas raised his hand, aimed, and struck
with force. A terrible crash, a flash of long white sparks, a smell
of burning – and he stood in a thick red cloud of brick dust
setting down slowly. The boulder had broken in two pieces that lay
in front of him, each driven into the ground almost by half. There
was a strong smell of burning and something more scary. Everything
was yellow around, as if the golden fall came suddenly in the
middle of green summer. All the monks, including the elder one, lay
on the ground, shielding their heads with arms, covering with a
yellow hem of cloak or at least a sleeve.</p>

<p>“Why the slab too?” Oleg grunted.</p>

<p>“Who knew their stones were so fragile…”
Thomas muttered, startled.</p>

<p>“No stones here, sir! Just clay. A fired
clay! It’s what they call bricks!”</p>

<p>“That’s something,” Thomas drawled with
disappointment. “They could make them of sand either… A childish
way, I swear on the innocence of Holy Virgin!”</p>

<p>The monks started to stir and rise. Their
swarthy faces turned out to be whiter than those of Norwegs, and
their narrow eyes opened so wide that the monks gained resemblance
to eagle-owls from the woods of Moscow or Gisland. Oleg clapped the
knight loudly on his iron back, to take him out of the state of
embarrassed rigidity. Both started a walk back to the porch where
the table had been changed in their absence, replaced by a broader
one. Oleg, with his keen eye, spotted ram side served with
porridge, baked turkeys stuffed with garden apples, not to mention
various small things, which he decided to sort out immediately.</p>

<p>On the way, they bowed politely to monks who
had been hitting, with the edges of their hands, all the day long,
a thick log fixed upon heavy boulders. At the moment, the monks
were not knocking it with their horny hands but stood stiff, like
hamsters near their burrows, goggling at the pilgrims from
North.</p>

<p>As Oleg went by, he shook his head, gave a
mettlesome hem, struck the log. They heard a terrible crush, wooden
splinters flew up and sideways with force. The halves of log
thundered down on the ground, only their very ends remained on
boulders. The motionless figures of monks had vanished: some fell
down, some were thrown away by splinters. Only the strongest ones
managed to run aside.</p>

<p>Thomas looked at him with reproach. Oleg
shrugged with the air of independence. “It’s rotten. Nibbled by
worms.”</p>

<p>“And bark beetles,” Thomas sympathized. “The
hot climate drives them mad. They even damage the stone here!”</p>

<p>They looked at each other and smirked,
feeling the terrible strain subsiding. They hugged each other by
shoulders and went upstairs. In fact, they were dragged on there by
the powerful magic of fragrances of the table served.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 17</p>

<p>They feasted in a proud solitude, save for
silent monks who appeared noiselessly from behind strange paper
walls, took the empty dishes away, put full ones instead. The new
courses smelled even more magical, stupefying.</p>

<p>Thomas had loosened his belt to the very last
hole in it and Oleg was slicing a young boar when a thickset,
broad-shouldered monk jumped through the window onto the porch. He
somersaulted, gave out a terrible screech, which Thomas and Oleg
had already got used to, waved his hands abruptly.</p>

<p>Startled, Thomas and Oleg watched him pull
some glittering thing from his wide belt, swing his hand swiftly
once more, and for the third time…</p>

<p>Thomas heard a thin tinkle against his iron
breast. He looked with surprise at the monk who stood pending, then
at Oleg who, in turn, shifted his gaze between Thomas and the
monk.</p>

<p>Finally, Oleg’s face lit, he nodded at the
floor. “It’s iron!” He felt up his chest for a while, then
disentangled a gleaming star carefully from the thick wolf hair.
The star was made of thick bad iron, its edges sharpened.</p>

<p>With caution, Thomas picked his star (it had
smashed like a bug of the hit) up from the floor, twiddled it
thoughtfully in his steel palm. Cursing the poor quality of iron,
apparently upset, he started to straighten its edges with care, as
if they were wings of a rare butterfly.</p>

<p>Looking at the knight, Oleg bent all the five
sharp ends inside, to prevent the monk from cutting himself, and
threw the star back to him politely. The monk shifted his
dumbfounded gaze from the guests to his throwing stars, then gave a
high-pitched, pathetic cry, as if his paw or something else was
jammed in the door, turned his back to them, took a running jump
out through the window, head first.</p>

<p>Thomas followed with eyes the glimpse of his
heels, shook his head respectfully. He could not have managed such
a jump, with five stones of his armor on and own significant weight
and height, but it was easy to monks. <emphasis>Light as cats. You can
hurl them from the roof down into the paved yard, and they’ll land
on their fours, dust off and run back onto the roof, where other
cats squeal at the moon!</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg gave a loud sigh. “Each country, each
tribe makes own rites… So how can these poor people do without
wars?”</p>

<p>“Pagans,” Thomas accused severely. “Christ
made the single rite for everyone. Take it and stop fighting.”</p>

<p>“Yes, but until his rites are taken by all
the world, keep your weather eye open. Or you may go, by accident,
too far before you know it. Mind it: one should not offend people.
Even if they are Pagans.”</p>

<p>They finished their meal in silence, feeling
anxious. The sun was high, but Oleg looked around and offered to
get out of harm’s way into the room allotted for them. <emphasis>Here,
behind the closed door, we can rest, sleep, wait for the
dawn…</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas cast a sharp glance at him. Oleg felt
the knight’s thoroughly concealed fear. His own heart felt wrung
with iron hand. <emphasis>In the morning, the two mighty warriors will
come for us to fight.</emphasis> Now the guests were allowed to rest
together with the monastery inhabitants only because the warriors
were absent, but by dawn they would be here. <emphasis>Maybe we should try
to lead the horses out in the night by stealth and gallop
away?</emphasis></p>

<p>They walked along a broad corridor, halfway
to their room, when some rough grey thing burst out suddenly from
the narrow slit in the wall. Oleg drew his knife convulsively. The
looped rope brushed against him and winded around the knight’s
gleaming body at once, in three rows. The fist-sized stone on the
end of the rope landed a final bang on the iron belly. Thomas
looked stunned. After a while, he realized being tugged, pulled
somewhere like a young bull on a tie. He seized the rope with both
hands and pulled.</p>

<p>The wooden wall burst with a crush,
scattering splinters, dry clots of clay. In the cloud of yellow
suffocating dust, Thomas and Oleg saw three monks rolling out to
their feet: sinewy and swarthy, half-naked, in strange woman’s
skirts. Their eyes, as black as thorn, were blazing on flat
decisive faces. The three monks were lean, with no drop of
excessive fat. They gripped the rope tightly, one had even winded
it round his fist, as large as a baby Angl’s or Slav’s.</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged in perplexity: he still could
not grasp the meaning of these rites. With caution, he dropped the
rope on the floor, where the stunned monks were lying, and walked
round them.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg left for the guest room. The
monks remained in the heap of splinters and clods for a long while,
following them with blurred eyes.</p>

<p>At night, Oleg felt restive. He heard Thomas
flinching in his sleep. Sometimes the knight groaned, tossed and
thrashed with an awful grit of his teeth. The fragile beds moaned
under their bodies, much bigger than those of monks. The night was
stiff. Oleg was dripping with sweat. He wanted to get up and wash
himself with cold water, but was afraid to get into a scrape: break
a taboo or step on a local relic. <emphasis>All tribes are passionate
towards their rites, and monasteries even more so.</emphasis> Only a
bitter experience could have given birth to the wise rule, “When in
Rome, do as Romans do…”</p>

<p>Oleg fell asleep at the daybreak, when the
eastern edge of the sky got red, but once a tiny tip of the sun
appeared above the horizon, he jumped up as if scalded. Thomas, in
his armor, sat by the door. He looked pale and haggard, watched the
wonderer with envy. “One can chop wood on you,” he said gloomily.
“A clear conscience, isn’t it? But those two fighters we are about
to combat don’t mind your soul. To withstand, we need something
more than clear conscience!”</p>

<p>“We have it,” Oleg grunted. He dressed up
quickly, feeling the knight’s inspecting eye on himself, the eye of
professional who could tell at once which muscles were developed by
heaving stones, which – by exercise with sword, which – by throwing
a spear, and which – by work with battleax. Oleg saw doubt in
Thomas’s eyes and gave a sullen smirk: the knight was not the first
expert to get confused by his muscle.</p>

<p>“What do we have?” Thomas asked
skeptically.</p>

<p>“The cup.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back in fright, felt the bag
with his palm. As his fingers followed the bulging curves tenderly,
his stern face softened.</p>

<p>There was a knock at the door. Thomas
unsheathed the sword, stood on the left of it. Oleg, with a
throwing knife in hand, crossed the room and removed the bar. A
monk in pompous clothing was there, standing in the corridor, his
face impenetrable, his eyes gleaming with malicious triumph. He
gave them a low bow, then made a sweeping gesture. A table on
castors appeared from aside, and Oleg’s guts gave an involuntary
loud croak. They sat down, loosing their belts and rubbing hands,
glancing and winking at each other.</p>

<p>The table was wheeled into the room by a
monk. While he shifted hurriedly the loads of plates from it to
their massive table, the other monk, a pompous one, was bowing to
Oleg and stiffened Thomas, trying not to turn his fat bottom to
them. At last, he said in a high-pitched, woman’s voice, “The
father superior begs humbly to know about how you are, whether you
had a good sleep, and asks you to taste our frugal monastic meal,
the food our gods sent us!”</p>

<p>Oleg was torn between the intent to run into
the yard and wash his face and to rush to the table. He heard
Thomas muttering, “By gods… One could wish to turn Pagan!”</p>

<p>The knight flopped down at the table
decisively, but Oleg dashed downstairs, splashed himself with water
near the well. Thomas had barely finished slicing the suckling pig
roasted in fragrant leaves when the door flung open and fresh Oleg,
with his eyes washed and shiny, darted across the room to the
table. Thomas gulped the saliva down and said skeptically, “Such a
washing – was it worth the trouble? Or that’s a rite of yours?”</p>

<p>“At least, I washed myself,” Oleg objected.
“Why <emphasis>you</emphasis> didn’t?”</p>

<p>“I like to wash substantially, not in a
slipshod way. At home, I would only bath in the lake. It’s just
under the windows of my castle…”</p>

<p>“In the lake? That’s good,” Oleg agreed. “But
what’s about winter?”</p>

<p>“Too short to mind it,” Thomas dismissed
casually.</p>

<p>They snatched the tender juicy meat. When
only several crushed bones, each no bigger than a nail, remained of
the pig, the stunned pompous monk ordered, with a weak gesture, to
bring the next course. He grasped that while it would be carried up
from the kitchen, the rest twelve dishes, with roast swans and
young geese, swollen with nuts and other things stuffed under their
skin, would become empty, well if not nibbled. Those men of North
were said to gnaw even at their shields…</p>

<p>Early in the morning, Oleg had been sure that
food would stuck in his throat before the duel with true fierce
warriors, but then – marvelous are the works of gods! – he gorged
on, feeling the violent strength spread inside his body, fill his
muscle, make the heart beat faster and blood rush quicker in his
veins.</p>

<p>Thomas ate like a bumpkin, his noble manners
forgotten. He snatched the biggest slices with both hands, ahead of
Oleg, spat the bones out onto the middle of the table, though there
was still enough space for those under the table. <emphasis>He could throw
them into corners as well, all four in the room.</emphasis> His lips and
fingers glistened with grease, the crunch of bones in his teeth was
incessant, as though it were a middle-sized stone breaker in Baron
Otset’s quarry.</p>

<p>Twice Oleg tried to tear himself away from
the table, as it is difficult to fight with your belly full, but
Thomas clapped on his shoulder with an air of doom: if one should
die, he’d better have fun before, and there is no fun like the
table set!</p>

<p>When the table was cleaned for the third
time, Oleg stood up. “We, the good sire and I, are ready,” he told
the pompous monk firmly.</p>

<p>The monk backed, bowing frequently, his
bottom pushed the door open, he vanished in the corridor. Thomas
sighed, started to get up from the table, his breath heavy and
strained, his pale face reddened.</p>

<p>Oleg slapped on his forehead. “At last I got
it, why you never take your steel off! To keep control of your
paunch, yeah? At the table you can go too far, but your armor knows
where to stop, doesn’t it?”</p>

<p>Thomas moved his eyes with displeasure, took
his sheathed sword from the corner, put his baldric on. Oleg also
belted with sword, adjusted the ties of bow and quiver of arrows on
his back, and followed Thomas out.</p>

<p>The father superior, supported under his arms
and followed by two old monks, ascended to meet them. At the sight
of two giant figures he stopped, took pause for breath, and made a
low bow. Thomas grumbled, as though he had only swallowed boulders
for lunch and now they were rolling inside his steel armor.</p>

<p>Oleg bowed in response, knowing his back
would endure. “We are ready,” he said briskly. “And the two
invincibles… Have they come?” Out of the corner of his eye, he saw
Thomas holding his breath, leaning forward to devour every word.
The knight’s lean face kindled with desperate hope.</p>

<p>The prior made a lower, more respectful bow,
fold his palms together, replied in a thin rasping voice. “They
came late at night. Our guard of honor met them.”</p>

<p>The knight’s face went dark. He lowered his
visor. For a while, three monks only saw his sky blue eyes through
the slit in his steel helmet. Then Thomas raised his visor, spoke
in a dull, absolutely flat voice. “We, sir wonderer and I, are
ready for the tournament. Let the herald deign to declare the local
rules and customs.”</p>

<p>“Did you look after our horses well?” Oleg
asked the prior. “If we are to fight on the horseback…”</p>

<p>The prior glanced at his assistants, but they
dropped their heads to hide their eyes. He folded his palms by his
chest, bowed low. “We have caught them and placed into other
stables. Don’t worry. They have the very best oats, fragrant and
medicinal herbs, spring water…”</p>

<p>Oleg alerted with foreboding. “What’s wrong
with them?”</p>

<p>The prior glanced at the monks again: all
kept their eyes down. He sighed and went on in the same thin
rasping voice that sounded like dishes clattering on a potter’s
jolty cart. “They… got angry for some reason. Or just wanted to
play? Anyway, they smashed their stalls, broke the manger, started
to offend other horses and… touch fillies. Then the black stallion
decided to scratch against the main pillar that supported the roof…
Strangely, the pillar broke. The roof collapsed… Both stallions got
scared.”</p>

<p>Thomas frowned, shot an indignant look at
Oleg. His warhorse, never frightened by wild howls of Saracen
trumpets and terrific beats of Persian drums, was said to have been
scared by some collapsed roof! A slander!</p>

<p>“Scared,” the prior said again, paying no
heed to the fact that Oleg frowned too, “they ran away, struck
against the wall…”</p>

<p>“Come, come,” Oleg encouraged.</p>

<p>“The wall collapsed. The stallions burst into
the garden. Other survived horses followed them. All the night
long, the monks tried to catch them. Your horses ruined the sacred
garden, which we were growing for three thousand years. They
guzzled the roses of heaven brought from the Lord of Heaven by his
beautiful daughter to the brave son of Emperor Fak at the dawn of
time… Then your horses drank water from the sacred spring, scared
away the sky frogs who deigned to rest there and broke the
thirty-year-long silence of the great ascetic Tsob Tso Bae…”</p>

<p>“What did he say?” Thomas asked with
fascination.</p>

<p>The prior’s wrinkled face became thoughtful.
He choked, then spoke hastily, “How can I, a paltry worm, memorize
the spells of ascetics? Then your horses brought down the monastery
wall on the side of Bump, our sacred mountain…”</p>

<p>“Scratched themselves again?” Thomas asked
with concern. “Sir wonderer, could they have picked up a mange? We
need to check.”</p>

<p>“So you need,” the prior agreed hastily.
“After that, they ruined the indestructible war tower – it had
stood for two thousand years, endured two hundred and three wars,
five hundred eighteen storms, and twelve strikes of lightning… they
scratched against it too. Then they ran after the young filly,
which was raised to carry the ruler of our land. They ate the
garden of bonsai, the dwarf trees, mistaking them for grass.
Finally, they got to the larder where we kept all our stock of
wine…”</p>

<p>“They drank wine?” Thomas gasped. He wheeled
round to Oleg with all his shining body, his blue eyes flashed with
lightnings. “Sir wonderer, it was your unproven horse who seduced
my honest friend at arms! With whom I passed fire and water, Crimea
and Rome, saw the priest’s pear tree, stormed the Tower of
David…”</p>

<p>“And here he stormed a tower himself,” Oleg
pointed out. “A <emphasis>war</emphasis> horse, who would argue? If he had never
broken into a wine cellar before… maybe he just had no
opportunity?”</p>

<p>The prior gave some timid coughs before he
dared to interfere. “In fact… it was <emphasis>your</emphasis> stallion, sir iron
knight, who started to lick first… At that point, we managed to
catch both and lead them into a new stable… after we moved all the
monks away from there, moved our library, carried ancient
manuscripts away. The white stallion got drunken and lay down into
a puddle of wine…”</p>

<p>“Our Lady!” Thomas cried in terror. “How much
time will it take to wash him clean?”</p>

<p>“I think they have a good wine,” Oleg said
thoughtfully, “if even horses got dead drunk… Holy prior, where do
you store it?”</p>

<p>The prior backed so hastily that he would
have collapsed if his trembling assistants did not catch him under
arms. “Your horses have drunk all of it! Now they sleep in the lib…
the new stable.”</p>

<p>Oleg listened and grasped, at last, the
meaning of the intermittent dull roar that had been disturbing his
soul and sleep. He wanted to inform the haughty knight venomously
that his noble knightly horse of blue blood snored like a plain
cart horse from village, but at that moment a barefoot monk came
running from the far barn, started to whisper in the prior’s ear,
looking at the scary strangers askew with his eye, as dark as a
bird’s.</p>

<p>The prior staggered. Two strong monks
supported him by shoulders. His dark eyelids flickered like a
butterfly’s wings in the wind.</p>

<p>Thomas turned his head to Oleg. It looked
like a turning observation deck on the top of a watchtower. “After
us,” he said in half a voice. “To fight the invincibles.”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, adjusted the sword baldric up –
he’d almost forgotten its unkind weight for the past years – moved
his shoulder blades to check whether the quiver was in place. “Holy
father, we are ready. Sir Thomas just need to be whistled up – and
he will run to the world’s end for a good fight! Pugnacious as a
cock. I wonder whether all Angles are like that.”</p>

<p>The prior shifted a desperate gaze between
his guests. Down at the stairs, a large crowd of monks had
gathered. All barefoot, belted with plain ropes, no usual poles and
rural threshing flails with them.</p>

<p>“Great warriors,” the prior rasped, “we hate
to upset you and kindly beg your pardon. We understand that your
brave hearts are burning with desire to display the full scope of
your martial art, that you crave for fight and sight of blood
splashed around, that you have a fervent thirst for crunch of
bones, for violent blows received and landed… received and landed…
received and landed…”</p>

<p>“Don’t pull the cat by… paw,” Thomas
interrupted. His soul could be seen reviving: a happy presentiment
of the dream come true flourished as a bright crimson color on his
cheeks, as white as chalk. “Where are they? In the yard? In the
dueling hall?”</p>

<p>The prior drooped his head in grief. He would
have kneeled if not kept by the monks: they were right to think
they would have more trouble getting him up. “I beg you, iron
knight… and you, hairy Hyperborean turnskin, to forgive us kindly!
The invincibles left at dawn. Without saying goodbye… without
saying a word at all, two on one horse…”</p>

<p>Thomas breathed out loudly, as though an iron
stake he had been writhing on till the night before was removed at
once. He even subsided a bit, seemed to become smaller in height.
Oleg also felt a great relief: he liked it without fight, but the
poor prior misinterpreted it. “Please don’t tear your brave hearts
with this unheard-of grief!” he cried pathetically. “It’s not our
fault it happened that way!”</p>

<p>“We shall not blame you,” Oleg promised.
“Never!”</p>

<p>“Did they say anything at their leave?”
Thomas asked with utmost caution. “A challenge, maybe, or a wish to
meet us in another place?”</p>

<p>The prior shook his head guiltily. “Nothing!
That’s surprising. Their leave was very quiet.”</p>

<p>“Hmmm… and what did they do when they came?
Why that sudden?”</p>

<p>The prior responded slowly. His voice grew
stronger, sounded with a note of fury. “That’s a great mystery for
us as well. I’ll have all the monks solve this riddle. No food for
them until they find the correct answer… or at least an elegant
one, in the spirit of our school. The invincibles came through the
gate on their splendid horses, their banners flied spectacularly in
the silver moon shade, their faces were stern and arrogant, as
befits invincibles. Then they saw the rock on which our heroes had
once been breaking bricks. It was broken, and they asked what had
happened… Then they saw the broken log and asked about it too… At
that time, your horses broke through the wall of stables and began
to chase fillies. Then, very unfortunately, the barrels of drinks
gave a leak. You stallions deigned to drink all our wine, and the
white one jumped on the invincible’s horse to mate…”</p>

<p>“Was it a mare?” Thomas inquired.</p>

<p>“No, but your stallion was so mad… sorry, so
delighted with our wine that he did not mind the difference. The
other horse tried to break away, but your stallion was much
stronger. Besides, the invincible’s horse could not endure his
weight, his spine broke…”</p>

<p>“Poor animal,” Thomas said indifferently.
“And what about mine?”</p>

<p>“He fell asleep and snoring straight on the
invincible’s crying horse. Due to that, we managed to catch and
carry him in his sleep to the lib… the stable.”</p>

<p>Oleg listened to the noise and thundering
sounds through the wall. “What’s about mine?” he asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>The prior shook his head dolorously. All the
monks standing at the distance behind him also shook their heads
and left them shaking like that. “Yours goes on. Do you hear the
thunder? It’s him running after the fillies, sheep, and she-goats,
trampling hens and ducks. He peeps into windows, scaring monks and
distracting them from godly reflection on the High… The invincibles
hurried to mount the surviving horse together and ride away,
because your cheerful stallion started looking at that horse too,
and it was much smaller: white, slim-legged…”</p>

<p>“No,” Oleg objected firmly. “My horse is not
that sort!”</p>

<p>Thomas gave him a once-over, as though seeing
for the first time, and burst with derisive laughter. “You know
little though you lived in caves! We found this horse several weeks
ago. Where had he lived before? Maybe in Greece? Besides, in that
very land where we… bought him, our merciful God had once in wrath…
in righteous wrath, of course!.. destroyed two big cities for such
tricks!”</p>

<p>Oleg kept listening to the crashes, croaks,
and neighs. “I heard much of the monastic wines,” he said then.
“We’d like to take some of it for the road, as befits true
ascetics, to make the temptation of low flesh stronger, for us to
fight it with all our might and have a more glorious victory!”</p>

<p>The prior backed and fell into the arms of
his assistants. “You too?.. Nothing will remain of the monastery
then!”</p>

<p>“Men are stronger than horses!”</p>

<p>Thomas also listened to the constant rumble,
nodded to the prior. “You are right, holy father. We have many
other things to fight. Sir wonderer, it’s time for us to leave,
isn’t it? Alas, no knightly joust nor a good fight to amuse us
here. The only hope is of some evil thing waiting on the road. We
have nothing to do here. We ate and drank but… er… some fun we’ll
have to find in some other place. And we will find it!”</p>

<p>The prior turned round and cried, “Pack up,
for the great northern warriors leaving us, the precious tribute…
er… gifts, food, and blankets. Now!”</p>

<p>The monks darted away in all directions. The
prior turned round with caution and was led across the garden where
Oleg saw a terrible picture of ruin. <emphasis>As though the hordes of
Attila passed here.</emphasis> The spacious stable of non-burnt clay had
crumbled. The big yellow blocks had rolled sideways, trampling and
maiming tender flowers and all but filling up the spring.</p>

<p>“Where’s my horse?” Thomas asked with
concern.</p>

<p>“The iron man’s horse is being woken up. They
play songs over him, beat in tambourines, give him aromatic salts
to smell…”</p>

<p>“Put your salts into ass,” Thomas advised.
“Yours, not the horse’s! My friend can only be woken by this.” He
slapped on his thick belt where a battle horn was hanging.</p>

<p>They followed monks across the garden. There
were much more ruins, Thomas even gave a puzzled whistle. If he did
not know it were two drunken stallions brawling at night, he would
have thought the monastery visited by godly crusader knights in
search of the Holy Grail.</p>

<p>The destrier lay in the middle of the
trampled-down garden and snorted, his eyes protruding frightfully.
The monks stood at a respectful distance, watched the monster with
awe. Thomas brought the horn to his lips, his cheeks puffed out. A
dreadful roar swept over the monastery. The window glasses
shattered down with plaintive ringing. The old prior and his monks
collapsed on the ground like overripe pears. The stallion’s left
ear twitched in vexation, but the wild modulating snores went
on.</p>

<p>Thomas cursed, took a deeper breath and blew
the horn again, reddened, with goggled eyes. A deafening roar rent
the air. Oleg jerked his head up and saw the monastic cupolas and
stucco moldings collapsing. The destrier moved both ears in
annoyance but his snoring only grew louder.</p>

<p>The knight glanced at the wonderer, saw his
venomous smirk. Thomas frowned, raised his horn hurriedly for the
third time. “Damn you, callous brute! To get that drunken while
your master was… preparing for a hard battle! Pretty nice you’d
have been under the saddle! Well, now I will get you awake, even if
you become a stammerer…”</p>

<p>He put the horn to his lips, but Oleg seized
his arm. “Wait! You’d only get him turning to other side. I’d
better fetch him with a stick!”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped with great indignation, almost
dropped his horn. “The knight’s warhorse? With a plain stick?”</p>

<p>“I can borrow a gilded one from the prior,”
Oleg suggested readily. He took the horn from the knight, squatted
near the stallion and blew almost in his ear. The destrier snuffed
and flew up, as though hundred snakes bit him at once, his eyes
wild and mad, his body trembling all over.</p>

<p>“Good morning, you drunkard,” Oleg greeted
venomously. “When your master is in hangover, he has only hands
trembling, as a hen thief’s, and you are shaking all over… Holy
father, is my horse in the library?”</p>

<p>From the yellow field of sprawled monks who
had just started to stir, a faint voice came, “Yes… There…”</p>

<p>“What is he reading there?” Oleg wondered.
“Never saw him at it before… I need to take him away quickly. Why
would I need a literate horse? I’d feel awkward riding him.” He
went to the low yellow building. It was shaking, clots of clay
dropped down from its walls.</p>

<p>“May your horse happen to be a Jew?” Thomas
smirked after him. “I heard they are all literate!” He started to
saddle his warhorse who stood reeling and watching him with
bloodshot eyes. The thick mane was tangled, with luxuriant burdocks
of rare eastern flowers of the Lord of Skies stuck in. The destrier
reeked of alcohol, his left side looked all bare: the hair on it
had got matted while he slept in the puddle of red wine. <emphasis>He
looks at the saddle and broad belly bands like a true crusader
looks at Saracen shrines.</emphasis></p>

<p>They heard a menacing clatter of hooves from
above. It was Oleg, descending by the broad stairs ahorse. His
stallion had red eyes of keen reader, with bulging veins in them,
but his steps were resolute enough, though deliberately cautious.
Mounted Oleg looked heavy and gloomy, like a rock in the middle of
a broad river. Behind him, two travelling bags were hanging on both
sides of the saddle, along with the giant sword and even the bow
and the quiver. The wolfskin jack was thrown open as wide as
possible, baring the broad plates of muscle. The wonderer was
girded by a wide belt studded with metal plates. On the right of
it, there was a pot-bellied flask that attracted Thomas’s
suspicious gaze at once. The knight even tried to catch the smell
of it. “I’m ready,” Oleg said, cheerful as a woken-up hare. “Holy
father, thank you for your bread and kindness.”</p>

<p>From the only spared building (though fresh
cracks had already appeared on its walls) monks were carrying out
the harness for Thomas’s horse and his saddle bags and bags of oats
for both horses and food for two weeks journey. Oleg saw no
wineskins. <emphasis>Probably the international custom of “the morning
after” drink is not known here.</emphasis> If it was, the prior would have
done his best to ensure that the humble pilgrims who avoid any
fight would get away as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Thomas climbed heavily on his horse who
reeled, moved his legs apart clumsily, and shook his head. Three
monks came running with the knight’s lance on their shoulders.
Thomas picked easily the shaft that had been polished by his iron
fingers, gave a dashing salute. “Thank you for your welcome! On my
way back, I’ll surely come to be your guest again. With
friends!”</p>

<p>Screaming, monks dashed away into the
building. Thomas turned his destrier to the wonderer who was
glancing impatiently at him.</p>

<p>They trotted out of the monastery gate
briskly. The iron horseshoes made a ringing clatter on the fragile
folds that lay on the ground, as they had collapsed from the mighty
roar of Sir Thomas’s battle horn.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 18</p>

<p>They had barely set off before the sun hung
straight overhead. Oleg was dripping with sweat, and Thomas had
even harder time: in his iron armor, he felt like a fish boiled on
a blazing fire. No wind, not a single cloud!</p>

<p>“What was our food there?” Thomas said
tensely. “Sir wonderer, would I disturb your pious reflections if
I… rend the air on this immense space a bit?”</p>

<p>Oleg waved his hand uncaringly. “Do it.”</p>

<p>He heard a loud rumble. The knight breathed
out with relief. His shoulders lowered, he looked back at the
vanishing walls of the yellow monastery where the blast wave had
gone to. “It’s the best time of my journey! As we rode to this
monastery, I was, to tell the truth, all of a tremble! I even –
would you believe it, dear sir wonderer? – was going to make a
turn.”</p>

<p>“Fear takes molehills for mountains,” Oleg
agreed. “There’s nothing worse than shaking too much before it
begins. A pity to discover it didn’t deserve that… But our life is
treacherous. In a place that looks peaceful, we can be ambushed by
some terrible thing worse than our nightmares! In that grove, for
instance…”</p>

<p>Thomas alerted, flung his hand onto the sword
hilt with a clang of steel.</p>

<p>“It was just an example!” Oleg comforted.
“Actually, there may be nothing. But, on the other hand, there can
be a thing far more terrible than I said or imagined…”</p>

<p>Thomas went pale. His hand drew the sword out
by a half, his voice gave a quaver. “You offer strange comfort,
holy father! May we better bypass it? Just in bloody case?”</p>

<p>“We can bypass a grove but not the life. You
had your meal and rest, now be ready for everything. The Secret
Seven have lost us but… will find again.”</p>

<p>“We can’t bypass a life,” Thomas admitted,
“but the grove… May I rend the air once more?”</p>

<p>“No, no,” Oleg said hastily and drove his
horse aside.</p>

<p>“Is the smell strong?” Thomas asked
guiltily.</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Oleg reassured. “Just irritates
my eyes. Turn to the grove. There we’ll find shade and – I see it
by crowns of trees! – a spring from the depth of earth. Its water
will put out the fire in your stomach.”</p>

<p>Thomas was getting tense. He stiffened, with
his eyes fixed on the approaching trees, then unsheathed his sword,
rode on with bare steel across his saddle.</p>

<p>Oleg came under the green shelter first. At
once, he felt as if a burden fell off his shoulders. His chest
straightened out, inhaling the cool air deeply. Trees ahead were
parting until he saw a big glade surrounded by mighty forest giants
with stocky trunks and tangled branches.</p>

<p>In the middle of the glade, green and studded
with flowers, there was a huge boulder of dark red and a lake, so
tiny that Thomas’s shield would have covered it all. A small spout
of water raised golden grinds that whirled and fell down. The
boulder had a hollow that contained a small mug made skillfully and
elaborately from clean pieces of bark.</p>

<p>Oleg vaulted off, took the mug. His horse
pushed him with his warm side, reaching for water. Oleg hastened to
lead the stallion away to the trees and tether. <emphasis>A lusty fellow
but doesn’t know when to stop. Drinking much cold water while being
hot makes a cripple at once.</emphasis></p>

<p>The mug was made not only efficiently, in no
hurry, but also painted with wonderful flowers, birds, and
ornaments. There was the upper sky with its waters, the middle and
even the lower one, but no underground at all, though enough space
for it at the bottom. Oleg realized that the painter was Pagan.
<emphasis>The Hell is the imagination of Christians.</emphasis></p>

<p>The water burnt his mouth, made his teeth
ache. It seemed to be running straight from the highest mountains
covered with eternal, never melting white snows.</p>

<p>Thomas took the full mug of spring water from
the wonderer’s hands. He gulped for a long time, watered the horses
after they’d got cool. When the unsaddled stallions went to graze,
he took the fragile mug with both hands again, twisted it before
his eyes, as if he could not believe in such a miracle. “There is
still in this damned world, full of treachery and blood, violence
and perfidy… there is still beauty and love! The stranger could
spit into this clear spring, spoil or foul… but instead he cleaned
the hollow, dragged the stone closer – see the old furrow where he
pulled it? – and made this fragile beauty of linden bark! There
<emphasis>are</emphasis> men in this world, sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>Oleg’s face twisted in a sulky smirk. “Except
the two of us? A third man, I see.”</p>

<p>The light fragile mug looked like a newborn
butterfly on a huge gauntlet, as Thomas sat on the boulder with the
thing in his palm, unwilling to part with it. His blue eyes that in
a fit of temper would turn cold, cruel, and merciless, like ice,
now looked as clean and unprotected as a child’s. “May Our Lady
help you in all your affairs, noble man,” he said piously.</p>

<p>The wonderer laughed. “What if he’s no
noble?”</p>

<p>Thomas was surprised. “How can he? Everyone
who does a good deed is noble… and helped by Our Lady!”</p>

<p>The wonderer was luxuriating in the shade. He
looked skeptical, and Thomas got angry. “Don’t you believe me?”</p>

<p>“Not that much,” Oleg replied evasively. “A
young girl with a babe in arms… What help of her? It’s not like
appealing to those sturdy lads: George the Victorious, Michael, or
the Forty Martyrs…”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said with great
dignity. “Be it known to you that Holy Virgin has sometimes helped
even knights! I can tell you of the case I witnessed. It happened
when we gathered for the annual tourney in honor of Saint Boromir.
The bravest of the brave were coming from all the ends of Britain.
The knights taught their horses and servants new tricks, while
their ladies prepared their dresses. In two days before the
tourney, we were all in place, looking forward to the arrival of
our friend: valiant Aragorn, a heir to an ancient house whose roots
go into remote antiquity… But the day went after day, and the brave
Aragorn was still not there when the heralds announced the
beginning of the tournament!”</p>

<p>“Probably he went whoring,” Oleg supposed
coolly. “A long way… He could spend a night at some widow’s.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer! What happened to Aragorn was a
marvel indeed. He set out three days before the tourney, like all
of us. But as he rode through a small town, he saw a black smoke
ahead and heard shouts. He spurred his trusty steed and, fast as a
whirlwind, burst onto the square where a terrible sight opened to
his eyes! A chapel of Holy Virgin was on fire. He heard women
crying inside.</p>

<p>“Sir Aragorn, without hesitation, as it
befits a knight, lowered his visor and galloped straight to the
barred door, with smoke and flames bursting from beneath it! The
door shattered of the knight’s blow. Sir Aragorn stormed into the
hell of burning walls and church plate. In the fire and smoke, he
managed to find a poor young woman: she got so mad with terror that
she resisted him picking her into the saddle. Sir Aragorn took her
out of the fire and left to the care of townspeople. He also left
his destrier, lest his luxuriant mane be burnt, and rushed back
into the fire! He was not seen for a long time. The townspeople on
the square started to cry with pity for the young knight when he
came out of the blazing church: staggering, burnt all over, but
clasping to his breast the icon of Holy Virgin he’d saved!”</p>

<p>“Was it worth the risk?” the wonderer
muttered, though he listened with interest. “Icons are the same
wood as spades, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir wonderer! Surely, he’d swallowed so
much smoke that he collapsed like dead. They needed a long time to
bring him to, and he was weak as a nestling. The best doctors
nursed the brave hero back to health, as the woman whom he’d saved
was a daughter of a grand seignior, and the icon was a gift from
His Holiness of Rome. Two days passed before Sir Aragorn was able
to mount. At once, he hurried to the tourney in Gisland…”</p>

<p>“Surely, he got late,” Oleg said
skeptically.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer, you have evil wits. As Sir
Aragorn approached the jousting field, he heard the silver trumpets
heralding the end of the tourney…”</p>

<p>“Late as a crow,” the wonderer grunted.</p>

<p>“And when he came to the gate, woebegone,
some dressed-up knights rode out to meet him. They dashed up to him
and started to congratulate, to admire his mighty blows, his
knightly art, his unfathomable skill to drive his horse by knees
only, with no touch to reins…”</p>

<p>The wonderer hemmed but kept looking with
interest. Thomas went on with ardor. “Sir Aragorn was astonished to
hear that he <emphasis>had</emphasis> come to the tourney at the very last hour,
challenged the strongest knights and threw them off, one by one,
with a single lance! He won an easy victory even over the powerful
Black Bull whom the strongest knights of Britain could never make
lurch in his saddle!</p>

<p>“Sir Aragorn offered a prayer to Our Lady and
told his friends everything. And all of us – I was also there –
thanked the Holy Virgin heartily, for she had assumed the aspect of
Sir Aragorn and took a horse and a lance to ride instead of him
into the jousting of the strongest knights! A noble deed wins an
award, sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>Oleg thought it over for a while. “But who
was babysitting for her?” he asked then innocently. “On the icons,
she has such a small child! With no eye on, he can burn down the
house or make such a mess…”</p>

<p>“It’s her business,” Thomas snapped angrily.
“But you don’t doubt the fact of her help?”</p>

<p>“Why would I?” Oleg wondered. “In our land,
we had dime a dozen female warriors. We also called them Amazons.
They drove a horse without reins, shot at a tilt… They would love
to throw a strong man off! I believe it. But who did she leave her
child with? Our girls only romped that way until they married…”</p>

<p>They left the grove after a brief rest but
Thomas for a long time kept looking back with pity at its peaceful
greenery. The trees were big, thick, ancient, their interweaved
green crowns sheltered the young grass from the scorching sun.
Unhurried moles dug their burrows underground, songbirds built
their nests in thick branches, and squirrels rushed merrily along
the branches and trunks.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg rode in a big arc, moving to
the north gradually, heading for the shore where they could take a
ship to Constantinople. They avoided any settlements, even detoured
around big caravans or groups of pilgrims, as those could remember
the strange couple.</p>

<p>Only on the fifth day of the journey did they
turn into a small village. They had run out of their bread and oats
and salt. Without the latter, no one could survive in such a hot
desert this land was to both of them.</p>

<p>The local smith examined the horseshoes,
fixed something in Thomas’s armor with his thundering hammer. “A
strange couple you are. Heading for Merefa?”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing. “Is it the nearest
city?” Oleg wondered.</p>

<p>“Yes, straight by the road. If you have some
gold, I’d advise you to visit Piven, a great magician.”</p>

<p>“What’s he good at?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>“He knows future. Tells you what happens
tomorrow and the day after it and next year! It always comes true.
We, local dwellers, know.”</p>

<p>Thomas, already mounted, gave a roar of merry
laughter. “If he’s a magician, why should we pay in gold? He must
know the spells to make gold of fallen leaves!”</p>

<p>The smith shrugged. “As you like. I only gave
an advice, as a good man to good people. Every magician can make
gold coins of leaves but they turn leaves again at touch of
iron!”</p>

<p>Oleg mounted and said a warm goodbye. Thomas
burst out with laughter again. “That’s why he dropped our golden
coin on his anvil first!”</p>

<p>When they got out onto the road, Thomas was
thoughtful. For a long time, he rode silent, then said firmly, “We
<emphasis>must</emphasis> visit that Piven.”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas…” Oleg began.</p>

<p>Thomas interrupted decisively. “Sir wonderer!
You have your vows, and I have mine. You serve the Truth, and I
serve love! I must find out how’s my Krizhina. Whether she waits
for me, whether her brothers oppress… And I swear I’ll know it! No
force will stop me!”</p>

<p>Oleg advanced his palms, as though sweeping
the knight’s anger away. “All right then! Find it out, I don’t
care. I thought you wanted to know <emphasis>our</emphasis> way…”</p>

<p>“And ride all that way trembling? No, thank
you! I’m no fool to wish to know my future. I don’t want to
undertake what belongs to God. But to know about Krizhina…”</p>

<p>He kept urging his horse on. Oleg watched him
with surprise: Thomas looked glowing: he leaned forward in the
saddle, as though ready to fly up and ahead of his galloping
stallion. At that moment, he seemed to have forgotten even about
the cup in his saddle bag.</p>

<p>The tall white walls of Merefa were visible
from afar but only half a day later did the meandering road lead
the travelers to the city gate. Thomas gawked at the walls of white
stone. He could see the stripes on the gate when their folds flung
open to the full, some riders in waving red cloaks darted out, one
by one, on lathery snorting horses, with a dim shimmer of blooded
swords and sabers in hands.</p>

<p>Thomas counted twenty of them. Five could
barely sit in their saddles, almost each one had his armor cut and
blood-stained. All the group swept by them like a whirlwind, along
the other road, heading for the green hills.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg made their horses shift from
gallop to cautious pace. Thomas gripped his lance tightly. Oleg
moved his shoulder blades habitually to check the place of the
bow.</p>

<p>There were sounds approaching from the city:
clatter of hooves, beastly roar, clang of steel, and loud blows of
war trumpets. A new group of riders on fast horses burst out of the
gate: all squealing shrilly, in furry caps, bloody sabers in hands.
They brandished fiercely, scattering drops of blood around. Their
horses flew like birds, as they were coming upon the first group.
The first rider in the second group snatched from his saddle hook a
bow with drawn string, put an arrow on, aimed, lingering, as he
needed to consider the skips of his galloping horse. Finally, he
let the bowstring off abruptly, his arm bent in a shape of hook.
Thomas and Oleg saw a flash of white teeth, as the man grinned.</p>

<p>The last rider in the first group was a young
boy on a tired horse, his face white and childish. He had neither
beard nor moustache but his shoulder and breast were stained with
blood. The arrow hit him on the back, just under the neck. The boy
gave no cry: he fell silently onto the horse’s neck, embraced it
convulsively, with the arrow feather stuck in his back. The rider
in furry cup squeaked, pulled the next arrow out of the quiver.</p>

<p>Thomas swore, shook his lance. The riders in
red cloaks dashed past them in three score steps. Thomas and Oleg
had time to discern young faces, rich blood-stained clothes. The
first were two warriors on milky-white horses, flanking and
covering with own big bodies the third rider: a young girl with
golden hair coming out from under a light shawl. Amazed, Thomas saw
a small golden crown on her head. After the golden-haired princess
or queen, the rest of warriors galloped: a live screen of dozen and
a half riders between her and the pursuers. The last of her
defenders jerked his hands up suddenly, fell out of the saddle like
a sack: an arrow was in his back. The horse dragged his body on,
his arms trailed helplessly in the dust.</p>

<p>Thomas wheeled round to Oleg. “Shoot!” he
roared in fury. “Shoot, you!”</p>

<p>“This is not our war,” Oleg snapped.</p>

<p>“Those are enemies!”</p>

<p>“How do you know which side is right?”</p>

<p>“A knight’s duty is to protect the weak! It’s
noble to be always on the weaker side!”</p>

<p>Oleg said nothing. “Hail Britain!” Thomas
bellowed in a thunderous voice. “If I don’t deliver the Holy Grail,
please understand and forgive me, Our Lady!” He spurred his horse,
drove to intercept the galloping riders in furry caps. Oleg swore
helplessly, snatched his bow.</p>

<p>Thomas galloped with a breakneck speed. Two
score steps remained between him and the beastly riders when the
first of them was pierced by an arrow. He had barely snatched at
his wound when the next one jumped up in his saddle, dropped his
reins, and the third rider fell down at full tilt, head first, as
though he plunged into a river.</p>

<p>Oleg’s horse stood motionless as a mountain
but Oleg swore furiously, shooting much slower than he’d like to.
Every Rusich should have six arrows in the air before the seventh
one hit the pumpkin in hundred steps. Oleg could shoot eight before
the ninth (or, more precisely, the first) one brought down a
wedding ring suspended on a silk thread, but the riders were
galloping at full tilt and Oleg shot, clenching his teeth, in fear
of injuring Thomas who was in the thick of the fight.</p>

<p>Thomas pierced a foe with his lance, seized
his sword, struck the second one and slashed the third before he
discovered that, just a moment before, all the three had been
killed with arrows shot so forcefully that they went into flesh up
to their white-feathered ends. Thomas yelled with offense and
insult, galloped on his mighty stallion through the party, throwing
aside the foes, both alive and shot down, until he clashed with the
back ones, unattainable for the arrows of damned wonderer. <emphasis>A
composed murderer. He knows no joy of the honest combat face to
face, eyes to eyes, courage to courage!</emphasis></p>

<p>Roaring, Thomas brought his menacing sword on
the nearest rider, slashed him down to the waist in his armor,
tugged the sword free with effort, as it got stuck in bones and
sinews, brandished at the next foe. One of enemies waved his saber
briefly and briskly to land a sider on the knight’s neck, another
rose on his stirrups, gave out a terrible howl, struck on the
sudden opponent’s head with his glittering Damask saber. Thomas
bellowed like a furious bear, dropped his shield, gripped the sword
hilt with both hands.</p>

<p>The left rider kept holding the broken handle
in fist. He could not believe his eyes, shifting his gaze between
it and his foe’s gleaming helmet. The long sword cut him
unprotected, his head and his arm, the one chopped away near the
shoulder, flew up with a dull sound. The other rider still tried to
cleave the knight’s neck, denting the blade of expensive saber and
annoying Thomas with clanging. The two-handed sword halved him down
to the waist.</p>

<p>Oleg shot the remaining arrows quickly. The
road was littered with corpses and wounded men creeping under the
hooves of mad horses, but Thomas was attacked by the five
survivors. Fortunately, other horses dashed about, bumped into each
other, neighed with fear, three dragged the riders entangled in the
stirrups. In such a mess, the five men could not gather and attack
altogether. Thomas spun round in his saddle like a loach, slashed
with his giant sword, bellowed threats.</p>

<p>Oleg wanted to stay aside until the fight was
over, but the two foes of Thomas cried something to each other,
then both sheathed their sabers and took heavy axes from hooks.
Both started to approach Thomas from behind: that made Oleg sent
his horse into a heavy gallop.</p>

<p>One rider had stolen into the thick of the
fight, raised his axe, but Oleg caught up and him seized by hand.
The rider looked back, white with pain: Oleg squeezed his hand
until bones crushed, only then he let the poor man out. The rider
cried in a guttural voice, snatched a knife from his belt by
another hand. Reluctantly, Oleg hit him in the face. Blood gushed
out, the rider collapsed silently to the hooves of his horse.</p>

<p>Thomas slayed two more foes. The fourth had
run into Oleg who waved away with sorrow: he had no wish to take a
human life though had to do it, so the last foe was left to Thomas.
The knight breathed heavily, his giant sword rose slowly, his armor
belched with steam.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a distant clatter of
hooves. Oleg and the rider in furry cap wheeled round together, and
Thomas saw, over their heads, it were the red-cloaked riders coming
back. He landed the last triumphant blow. The dead man, halved down
to the saddle, slipped off the horse and plopped heavily on the
road, which was already flooded with blood, strewn with corpses and
moaning wounded men.</p>

<p>The red-cloaked riders stopped in ten steps,
looking over the place of battle with distrust. Between them and
the city they’d left, there were at least twenty dead enemies lying
on the trodden road. Eight more men were crawling away into the
thick ripe wheat, dragging their guts, left red traces behind. One
of the red cloaks, an elderly man with malevolent face, vaulted
off, rushed along the tracks into the wheat, unsheathing his saber
on the run.</p>

<p>Thomas sheathed his sword, waved his empty
hand as a greeting. “Good sires! We, my friend and I, thank you for
the opportunity to have a fight!”</p>

<p>They watched him with goggled eyes. “Have… a
fight?” one repeated in perplexity.</p>

<p>“Yes, I mean it. We rode for three days, and
no one to cross weapons with!”</p>

<p>The riders parted, giving way to the
golden-haired beauty with the crown on top of her head. He sat
majestically on a splendid white horse, but her rich clothing was
stained with soot. The rider on her right glanced at Thomas
angrily, spat on the dusty road. “My princess,” the rider on her
left told her loudly, “they are no true men! Wandering brawlers.
They don’t care whom they fight.”</p>

<p>“Mercenaries?” the princess asked softly. Her
musical young voice, a bit husky with excitement, made Thomas’s
heart jump up to the throne of the Lord and fell down into the
fire. He found no words to answer her, he could only look in her
eyes, of the same blue as his own.</p>

<p>The rider on her right replied instead of
Thomas, with disgust in his hoarse voice, “Worse. They fight even
if not paid, just for joy. Beasts of North!”</p>

<p>Oleg dismounted, gathered his arrows hastily,
took the quiver of the furry-capped man who’d shot the young boy.
He listened to the conversation from distance. “As I told you!” he
cried to Thomas. “They can have other values here!”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, spoke in a tone of gross
insult. “We came to the aid of the weaker side! This is how noble
men do on my North, that’s true. I hope someday nobility will come
here too… even if it comes at our sword points.”</p>

<p>“Who are you?” the golden-haired princess
asked. The horse under her pawed the ground with its slim chiseled
legs, proud of such a beautiful rider. The crown on her golden hair
was scattering the sparkles of diamonds, sapphires, even amber, the
rare gem from northern lands.</p>

<p>Her men watched Thomas and Oleg with a
mixture of fear and hope. Three more of them dismounted and walked
around with knives in hands, turning the bodies of enemies, cutting
throats, gathering weapons. Five riders were trying to catch the
empty horses.</p>

<p>“A knight crusader,” Thomas replied proudly.
“Sir Thomas Malton of Gisland. I’ve slain giants, killed Saracen,
fought a dragon, ate the roast liver of the lion I killed with my
own hands. Now I’m coming back to my northern homeland. The one who
rides with me is my friend, a noble sir wonderer from Scythian
Rus’… or Rossian Scythia… from Hyperborea, in a word. He’s a great
warrior and greater ascetic and hermit. His posture and words are
full of dignity and speak out his noble origin, though he denies it
in every possible way.”</p>

<p>The princess cast a glance at Oleg and forgot
him at once, as she spoke to Thomas with passion and great
entreaty, “Enemies broke into my city, my beautiful peaceful
Merefa! You need to leave: they spare no one. I think it’s better
for you to ride away with us.”</p>

<p>“Who are your enemies?” Thomas asked
arrogantly.</p>

<p>“I’m a queen,” the golden-haired maiden told
him. “Isosnezhda, a daughter to Kryg. The enemies came by stealth
into the city, into the palace! They were led by the royal
treasurer. He knew the underground passage. My father trusted that
man like himself, and he… when Father died, he wanted to marry me
and become a new king! I refused him, and he gave our treasury to
barbarian chieftains to buy their warriors. Now they are making
slaughter in my city!”</p>

<p>“It seems we’ll have to make our way round
Merefa!” Oleg told Thomas while walking to the horse.</p>

<p>Thomas blushed to the roots of his hair. He
sounded sharp as his sword. “A slaughter or Beltane dances, I don’t
care. I <emphasis>must</emphasis> see Piven!” He drove his horse ahead by the
road to the city. Oleg glanced back at the motionless warriors,
mounted with a heavy sigh.</p>

<p>Thomas reined up near the open gate, shot a
commanding look back, as though Oleg had no choice but to follow
him. Oleg trotted after him, feeling the hilts of throwing knives
and the sword hilt. Then he felt the ends of arrows and discovered
the ones he’d taken from dead furry-capped riders to be three
fingers shorter.</p>

<p>As Oleg came up to the gate, he heard a
clatter of hooves behind. He and Thomas were caught up by two
sullen warriors: he’d seen them beside the beautiful queen. “We’ll
ride with you,” one of them grunted. “You don’t know the city.”</p>

<p>Thomas grinned and winked to Oleg.</p>

<p>The four of them burst into the wide open
gate, dashed along the main street. Shouts and malicious laughter
were everywhere, as the furry-capped warriors broke into houses,
shattered the doors and windows of shops, flung things, clothing,
and furniture out through the smashed windows into the street.
Straight in the street, two women were raped. A naked old man was
crucified on the door of his house, while women and children cried
and squealed around.</p>

<p>The battle on the main square, in front of
the palace, was burning out: about a hundred soldiers in red cloaks
stood in a circle, covering with shields and repelling sluggish
assaults. Pressed to the palace, they held there firmly, bristling
with swords and spears, while their foes glanced back with envy at
those who dragged the loot, stripped women naked, tore earrings out
of their ears, broke their fingers to get precious rings. The
barbarian chieftain, huge and stout, also in a furry cap, bellowed
fiercely, commanding attack, but most of his preferred to plunder
the captured city rather than to fight its last defenders.</p>

<p>The four riders galloped by the edge of the
square, passed by a very old man bound to a pillar. Two furry caps
were prodding him with blazing torches, the old man shrieked, the
warriors yelled. Oleg heard, “Money! Where’s your gold?”. On the
other side of the square, a score of red-cloaked soldiers were
cornered by a huge spider, as large as a fat camel. They beat off
desperately, but the spider was deft and quick in making its web
and throwing it, with a wave of forelegs that looked like ceiling
beams, on the victim. The man tried to slash the silver rope with a
sword but it got stuck fast, and the spider was dragging him,
screaming, quickly into its awful jaws.</p>

<p>Thomas bellowed in fury when he saw the
spider’s enormous jaws closing on the poor man’s head: the blood
gushed in all directions, splattering stone. The two queen’s
warriors flanked the monster, slashed it with all their might, but
the spider’s thick hair endured the blows. Its monstrous legs
gripped the other man, brought him to the greedy open mandibles
dripping with human blood.</p>

<p>“Our Lady!” Thomas cried. “Forbid the
desecration of man by insect!” He advanced his lance, leaned to the
horse neck. The spider heard the menacing pace of a heavy horse,
span round at once, raising its legs with threat. Two big
unblinking eyes were fixed on the galloping knight, the rest six,
smaller ones, watched coldly the red-cloaked soldiers stiffened
with perplexity and utter exhaustion.</p>

<p>Thomas fell upon, like a mighty rockslide
from a mountain. The long broad steel head of the lance crunched
into the monster’s wide chest. The spider stretched its hairy legs,
its claws almost reached the knight. The warhorse squealed in wild
fear, like a strangled pig, and pranced, thrashing with hooves.
Thomas released his lance, reined the horse back.</p>

<p>The spider made a quick silent step after the
knight, but the lance, with its thick end rested on the ground,
hampered it. As the monster reached out for its retreating prey, so
fragile, the lance was going deeper into the body, Thomas heard the
crash. The forelegs had all but touched Thomas’s face when other
legs of the spider suddenly gave way and the whole hairy body sank
heavily. The red-cloaked soldiers, panting, with their swords and
shields dropped down, watched their sudden savior in steel
armor.</p>

<p>Two grim warriors who accompanied Thomas and
Oleg rode forward. “Tilak?” one cried happily. “Tilak, the queen is
safe! Go through the eastern gate.”</p>

<p>The front soldier, spattered with blood and
the spider’s yellow saliva, asked briskly, “Who is this hero?”</p>

<p>The sulky man replied after a pause, his eyes
still unfriendly. “A traveler… and his friend. That one in wolfskin
who looks like a forest animal. They want Piven, the magician. Is
he there?”</p>

<p>“I saw him in the tower,” Tilak said. “But he
sealed it with a spell, for no one to come in!”</p>

<p>The soldiers started to get out of the back
street where the spider had driven them into. One of them listened
to the distant noise and shouts, then cried, “There’s still a fight
at the square!”</p>

<p>“Att’s men,” the gloomy guard said in a
sullen voice. “At least one out of three survived.”</p>

<p>Tilak wheeled round to his men. “Should we
leave the city or help Att? Will we forget the enmity between clans
in front of the common foe?” The warriors thrust their swords up.
Tilak rushed to Thomas, taking hardly any notice of Oleg. “Will you
help?”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>You</emphasis> have nothing to do here,” Thomas
replied politely. “All foes left for robbery. Those on the square
are no warriors but shepherds. They can only see to Att’s men
staying in place!”</p>

<p>He whipped his horse and rushed to the tower
on which Tilak had pointed. It was seen on the other end of the
city. At first, Thomas only heard the clatter of hooves of his
destrier, then the horseshoes of the wonderer’s stallion rang
heavily behind. Thomas glanced back: two grim warriors were
explaining something fierily to Tilak’s men until they dashed to
the square. Then both sullen bodyguards of the golden-haired queen
darted, whipping their horses, after the northern warriors.</p>

<p>Thomas smirked victoriously. He had no need
of those two warriors, though their swords <emphasis>were</emphasis> a help, but
he was flattered by the young beauty’s being anxious about the life
of her unknown savior, the mysterious knight from a strange
northern land!</p>

<p>They darted along narrow streets, sometimes
trampling robbers with hooves, almost never using their weapons.
The tower was growing ahead slowly, shifting to the right or to the
left. Thomas could already make out its grey bricks and the round
platform on its top.</p>

<p>The first grim warrior came up with Thomas.
“No way in,” he said sullenly. “The magician seals his tower with a
spell.”</p>

<p>“Is he blind to what’s going on here?” Thomas
exclaimed.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t care,” the sullen warrior
replied. “Whoever sits on the throne, he’ll make gifts to the
magician, give him slaves and servants.”</p>

<p>The tower was squat and ancient, its dented
stones looked like untidy grey curds. On the right, there was a
massive iron door, with strange signs and figures painted in green
on it.</p>

<p>Both grim warriors glanced back at the knight
awaiting for his decision: the door had neither bars nor locks,
only magic. Impeded Thomas turned to the silent sir wonderer, a
hermit and great ascetic of noble origin. Oleg, staying in the
saddle, rummaged in a bag with medicinal and other herbs for a
while, fished out a half-dried blade of grass, leaned to the door
and tucked the leaf into a slit in iron.</p>

<p>They heard a loud click. The door flung open,
as though kicked with great force. The gloomy warriors gaped on it,
and Thomas acted as if the wonderer had been opening doors for him
with the famous Slavic break-grass for lifetime. He touched the
reins impatiently, and his stallion moved into the doorway. Thomas
bowed, lest his head hit against the low ceiling. Others caught
only a glimpse of the tail of his destrier.</p>

<p>Oleg followed the knight, bending even lower.
“Great warriors!” a hasty voice called from behind. “The magician
lets no one in… and you are ahorse!”</p>

<p>Oleg said nothing and soon heard hooves
behind. Both guards, with pale twitched faces, rode after them
steadfastly, though keeping a respectful distance. Oleg looked
around with surprise: he did not think there was enough room even
for two riders but the fourth one came in before the door clanged
back to its place.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 19</p>

<p>The spacious hall where they came to be in
went dark for a moment before some lamps lit up. From the upper
floor, by narrow stairs covered with an expensive carpet, a small
hunched old man, in a long oriental robe painted with comets and
Cabalist sigils, ran down to them hastily. He could barely keep up
his head under the burden of enormous green turban, with an ominous
bloody-red light of a big ruby over his forehead and a quivering
peacock feather of incredible size. “Who?” the old man shouted as
he ran. “Who are you?.. Hey, servants!”</p>

<p>There was a fast footfall. Past the old man,
some brawny warriors with dark brown bodies ran down. Pieces of
armor were fastened with belts on their naked bodies. The warriors
moved in a strange way, keeping their eyes on their master.</p>

<p>Thomas turned his horse aside, for the great
magician to have a better view of his big half-unsheathed sword.
“Wait a bit, great magician and oracle,” he said with dignity.
“You’ll need your servants later. But if they make one more step,
you’ll have to wash up and sweep the floor yourself! I swear it on
the hooves of my destrier who I stormed the Tower of David
with!”</p>

<p>He heard a nervous clatter of hooves behind.
The queen’s grim bodyguards backed their horses to the door in fear
but found the folds closed tightly.</p>

<p>Disregarding the threats of ignorant knight,
the magician breathed in, raised his hands. His sharp eyes fell on
the motionless barbarian in animal skin. The barbarian replied with
a direct stare. For several long moments, they were in a duel
invisible to others, then the magician lowered his hands slowly.
“Who are you?” he said as though in sleep. “What you want?”</p>

<p>Thomas heard the queen’s bodyguards gasp with
one voice at the door. He straightened up in the saddle, replied
firmly. “I’m a knight crusader. Even a fool can tell it by my
cloak. My friend is a pilgrim from Scythian Rus’… hell’s bells,
Rossian Scythia… In a word, he’s a Scyth, descendant to the extinct
ancient Ruses! He’s highborn. We have an urgent need to know what’s
happening now in one noble family in Britain, far away… We have
gold to pay you!”</p>

<p>The magician shot a glance at the motionless
barbarian of Hyperborea, definitely trying to fathom his strange
interest in the faraway family in Britain, thought over
possibilities and consequences for a while. His reply was abrupt
and bitter. “Get out of my tower!”</p>

<p>Thomas’s hand darted to the sword hilt but
unclenched helplessly the next moment. The magician bared his small
yellow teeth in a malevolent grin. Everything was as he’d reckoned:
the knight would do no harm to the unarmed, and the northern
barbarian was only to accompany the iron-headed, not to fight
instead of him.</p>

<p>“What about fairness?” Thomas demanded
angrily. “Do magicians live in other world?”</p>

<p>The magician sent his servants upstairs with
a casual gesture. “I leave the slave work to slaves,” he jeered.
“No evil shall pass where I stand.”</p>

<p>“Neither it shall where <emphasis>we</emphasis> stand!”</p>

<p>The magician sized him up derisively. “You
are just a woodcutter. I have nothing to do with wood.”</p>

<p>One of the sulky guards (their horses were
shifting legs near the door) grew bold enough to speak in a timid
voice. “O great and illustrious magician! Our city, our splendid
Merefa, is plundered by cruel enemies, barbarians of desert.
Wouldn’t it be better for you if the city remained in hands of good
queen?”</p>

<p>The magician’s eyes sparkled. He puffed, as
though going to kill that insolent man by a spell, but then caught
a warning look of the northern barbarian and replied through
gritted teeth, “I don’t mind on which horses my firewood is
brought: on bay or light brown ones. If you do, then drive the men
of desert away.”</p>

<p>The other bodyguard, who had his ear pressed
to the door, cried out suddenly, “Barbarians came from other side!
If they shatter…”</p>

<p>“Nothing on earth…” the magician began
proudly but stopped short as he glanced at Oleg who had opened that
door not long ago.</p>

<p>Thomas breathed fast, his chest heaved
wildly. At one moment, he gripped the sword hilt, ready to force
the magician who was definitely no noble man, but at another, he
remembered the Christian virtues, along with the magician’s being
unarmed and far past the age for fighting…</p>

<p>Oleg listened to the barely audible shouts
and clang of steel. “Sir Thomas, we must go. We’ll be back! The
great magician still thinks his tower is above the fight. Let him
see it isn’t. That will make him more compliant!” He rode up to the
entrance door, tucked a blade of grass into the slit. The
bodyguards pulled the reins and bared their swords. The door flung
open. The barbarians who were pounding on its outer iron surface
recoiled in surprise.</p>

<p>The grim bodyguards were the first to burst
out. They landed violent blows sideways, in a hurry to do as much
damage as possible, their horses knocked the foes down. Oleg’s
stallion made a heavy long leap out onto the sunlit square. The
wonderer slashed with sword in all directions, knocking down both
mounted and pedestrian soldiers in fur caps. After him, Thomas flew
out like a steel demon of death: each strike of his sword clove the
enemy down to the saddle. The tower door banged shut behind the
knight, so they only heard the clang of steel and screams of dying
men.</p>

<p>“Let’s get out of city!” Oleg shouted. “Or
the whole bloody tribe will come here!”</p>

<p>When the dozen of foes was reduced to a
couple of backing men, Oleg prohibited to chase them and drove his
horse first, in gallop, to the eastern gate. Behind him, there was
a thunder of hooves of three horses: one heavy and two light ones.
The bodyguards galloped at their heels without meddling in fights.
Thomas guessed it right: the queen commanded only to protect the
strangers.</p>

<p>They darted along the street as a whirlwind,
their horses trampling on marauders, their swords reaching the
robbers who ran across their way. Several times Thomas tried to
stop and rush to the aid of the offended, but either of bodyguards
seized the bridle of his horse and dragged him along after the
Hyperborean.</p>

<p>The road brought them to a tall wall of white
brick. The huge gate lay on the ground, the gape of it being webbed
by a giant spider, even bigger than the one killed by Thomas.
Another spider of the same size gorged itself on the dead and
wounded men who lay around the broken gate in scores. <emphasis>There was
a fierce fighting.</emphasis></p>

<p>Three furry-capped warriors were shifting the
corpses. They kept away from the spider’s long legs, jumped aside
in fear should the vampire drop a drained body and reach for the
next one. They were filling their big sacks with adornments, rings
and earrings, pouches of coins.</p>

<p>Thomas nodded at the marauders. “Will you do
them?” he asked the bodyguards. “And the insects are ours. As a
child, I hated spiders!”</p>

<p>“You only hated,” Oleg said angrily, “and I
was <emphasis>afraid</emphasis> of them!”</p>

<p>They drove horses in gallop again. Thomas,
with faithful lance under his arm, rushed to the corpse eater,
while Oleg rode up to the giant webbing the breach in the city
wall. The spider was as large as a fat bull, not to count its
enormous legs, each the size of a log – but an easily bent hairy
log, with knife-sharp thorns hidden in the thick hair. Each of
eight legs ended with a sinister curve of a long claw, which
resembled a Persian khanjal, though too curved one.</p>

<p>The huge hairy belly had four twitching pipes
that looked like goose necks, set close to each other, dripping
with saliva-like liquid setting at once and making a viscid glue.
The spider pulled it on with two legs, twisted into a single rope,
as thick as a ship one, hooked it up to the stone slabs hastily,
ran aside, stretching the thread, and hung it on the other side of
the opening. The rope had sticky sparkling drops on it: the spider
would put those all over its web, with a step interval. <emphasis>Should
the thread be sticky all</emphasis>, Oleg thought involuntarily, <emphasis>as the
ignorant common folk thinks it is, the spider would not be able to
run on his web: he’d get stuck himself!</emphasis></p>

<p>He pulled out the knife, sawed the
load-bearing thread with difficulty: it was the thickest, framing
one. <emphasis>It’s easier to saw silk</emphasis>, he thought gloomily, <emphasis>hemp,
or even a rope of iron threads! A cobweb is hundred times that
tight. One could subside the whole city of Merefa, with its walls,
towers, palaces, and kennels, on this single rope!</emphasis></p>

<p>The spider dashed about, as it felt something
wrong. Faster, Oleg cut the rest three ropes. The construction
collapsed, blocking the gap with a grey tangle of cobwebs, with
sticky beads gleaming on it very close between. The spider darted
up to its web. Oleg made several steps aside, stopped dead. The
spider started shoveling the silvery ropes up to itself, the
forelegs tucked them, in disorder and hurry, into the mouth
breathing out hot stench. The insect almost choked but kept
swallowing its precious thread. Its dark unblinking eyes were fixed
at Oleg but the wonderer did not stir: as a sorcerer, he knew that
spiders can barely distinguish light from dark and even the most
sharp-sighted ones of their kind are unable to see farther than
their noses.</p>

<p>Behind Oleg, there were still crashes,
shrieks, grinds of steel, scary neighs of scared horses, clanks of
swords. He did not look back. He waited until the spider picked the
last thread, thrust it into the jaws and went backing along the
city wall. Eight dark eyes on the top of its hairy head seemed to
be looking in all directions. Oleg gave himself a word that some
time he would find out what those huge eyes served for. <emphasis>They see
not a damned thing, but still each new generation of spiders comes
into the world with them, again and again!</emphasis></p>

<p>Finally, the spider got away to find another
crack. Oleg turned his face to the fight. The knight had landed
such a mighty blow that pierced the spider through but also threw
Thomas into its hairy legs. The agonizing creature gripped him with
all the eight of them, rumpled, tucked into the monstrous
mandibles, trying to crack the steel shell of armor. Bathed in
sticky saliva, Thomas struggled out, keeping his limbs pressed to
the body, lest the spider break them away. His empty-saddled horse
had run aside and stood there, crouching, shaking all over.</p>

<p>The bodyguards had killed two marauders. The
third one was backing, trying to parry their blows. One grim
warrior left him to his friend, ran up to the spider, struck it on
the lower, bearing leg with all his might. The blade cut a sinew.
The leg gave way, some viscous whitish blood came out. The spider
flinched, dropped Thomas. With a terrible thunder, the knight
collapsed on the stones. The shaggy carcass of the spider fell
noiselessly on top of him.</p>

<p>The three men tried to drag the monster away,
but it seemed to be stuck to the ground, pressing down the
motionless knight. One guard fetched both heavy horses, the
knight’s and the pilgrim’s one, belted a spider’s leg round and
drove the horses away, brandishing his sword. The other one stood
with bare sword in the middle of the alley, shielding the spider
and the knight: some barbarians had emerged at a distance.</p>

<p>They managed to shift the spider a bit. Oleg
reached Thomas’s leg, pulled him out. The steel armor grinded on
the cobblestones, leaving deep scratches. Altogether they lifted
the stunned knight on the horseback. The bodyguard hugged his
shoulders, got soiled with sticky yellow saliva and whitish blood
at once, and they rode out through the gape, now free of
cobwebs.</p>

<p>They saw a big party of barbarians riding
towards. <emphasis>About a hundred furry-capped warriors.</emphasis> With a heavy
sigh, Oleg took the bow, put an arrow on. One guard bared his
sword, clasped the reins. The other one who supported Thomas cried
suddenly, “Tilak! Waiting for us!”</p>

<p>They saw red-cloaked soldiers, also about a
hundred, rushing to them at full tilt from the crest of the hill.
The first was Tilak, with his plain face and predatory glitter of
sword in hand. He seemed to have not only his score but also the
warriors who’d been keeping a perimeter defense of the palace
square under the command of Att.</p>

<p>The barbarians slowed down, then pulled up.
They had no wish to meddle in a bloody and fierce fight with
desperate men, professional warriors who had no valuable
possessions, while a wealthy unprotected city is close at hand,
just behind the broken gate.</p>

<p>The four men rode slowly (because of Thomas
swaying in his saddle) to meet Tilak. He had his galloping party
stop, raised his sword in a greeting. “Thank gods! You alive. How’s
the city?”</p>

<p>“You saw it,” the guard who supported Thomas
replied grimly. “Men of desert brought monstrous spiders with them.
These creatures devour people dead and alive, spread panic and
terror. The city is plundered. Where’s Att?”</p>

<p>“He died, shielding me with his own
body.”</p>

<p>“The inter-clan enmity forgotten?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But the price was terrible.”</p>

<p>Tilak’s men surrounded them. The close group
rode away from the city, waded a small river, ascended into a
narrow valley between green hills. The green place was red with
cloaks: lots of warriors, wounded or dog-tired, lay in a sparse oak
grove and around it. Their horses grazed aside. Women bustled among
soldiers, carrying jugs, helping healers to dress up wounds. Some
fires were blazing high, water boiled over them in sooty
cauldrons.</p>

<p>Near the grove, there stoop a tent of yellow
silk. A small red flag on top of it was trembling under the blows
of wind. Around the tent, exhausted warriors sat straight on the
grass but their swords lay close at hand. At the sight of galloping
riders, several man rose up and barred the entrance into the tent.
They moved in no hurry, as they saw red cloaks on the newcomers and
the first rider was Tilak, known to many if not all soldiers.</p>

<p>The heavy trample of several hundred hooves
must have been heard inside the tent, as Isosnezhda, the
golden-haired queen, came quickly out of it. She had washed her
face and put her hair in order, but her blue eyes were still
blazing with fury.</p>

<p>Tilak dismounted first, gave her a low bow.
“My queen! We fought as hard as we could. If not these Franks, I’d
have stayed in the city. Due to them, we’ve taken out even the men
of Att. They fought on the square!”</p>

<p>Isosnezhda turned her eyes on the bodyguards.
Both of them kept beside Thomas, though he was sitting in the
saddle firmly by that time. On the left arm, he had a gleaming
shield with his coat of arms, and a giant lance, formidable with
its size, was swaying in his right hand. One guard rode ahead and
bowed. “My queen! The Franks have been to the captured city. They
even broke – we’d never have believed it! – into the tower of great
magician! They also slew the monsters whom the men of desert
brought.”</p>

<p>Thomas coughed with confusion and interfered.
“There’s little honor in breaking into a helpless old man’s place.
And the monsters… I doubt whether you mock me. In my country, any
servant can kill spiders with his broom. Those were your warriors
who fought bravely, Your Majesty!”</p>

<p>The riders who had come with him were
dismounting, leading their horses away. They glanced at the mighty
knight, due to whom they broke out of the city, with fear and
respect.</p>

<p>“They took us aback!” Isosnezhda said in
fury. “We had only a small force in the city.”</p>

<p>“If there are more hosts,” Thomas spoke
slowly, with his admired eyes glued on the golden-haired queen, “it
would be a good idea to send for them.” He dismounted. Young boys
came running to him, helped to take off the heavy armor, which was
caked in the blood of others and the spider saliva and slime.</p>

<p>Oleg found a stream and got into the cold
water. He bathed, hooting with delight, splashed himself with water
from cupped hands, as though afraid of drowning.</p>

<p>Isosnezhda took a quick counsel with Tilak,
then came up to Thomas. “Sir, I see you are not only a brave
warrior, but also versed in strategy. I have big groups of my
trustworthy hosts on the border of my kingdom. It’s two days
journey from here.”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head. “Too long. As soon as
tomorrow, the barbarians will put a strong guard on the gate and
have common men walling in the breaches. We need to attack now!
While their battle fever is down, while they are dispersed,
robbing, raping, and drunken. I saw them breaking into a storehouse
of wine. They are no fierce host anymore but drunken robbers! But
tomorrow they’ll turn warriors again.”</p>

<p>The queen cast a glance at the green valley.
There were three hundred warriors but hardly twenty men up their
feet: the rest were sprawled in the grass with exhaustion. A third
of them was suffering from wounds they’d not noticed in the heat of
the battle. “I would go with you!” she said bitterly. “But look at
my men!”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted his feet as he glanced the
grove and the valley over. Only the greatest stayers were coming to
fires and trying to eat, but even their faces expressed despair and
submission to the doom. The rest lay with their arms spread, too
weak to talk or even to take their armor off.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow we won’t have such a good chance,”
Thomas reminded her. He bent his knee slowly. Isosnezhda came
closer. Even kneeling, the knight was almost as tall as the young
queen. He felt the warmth emitted by her body. Her blue eyes were
large and begging, her golden hair seemed to have a brighter gleam
than her crown with all its jewels. “My sword is at your service,
Your Majesty!”</p>

<p>She touched his broad shoulder with her
gentle hand. His thick knitted sweater was wringing wet and smelled
of strong male sweat. Her thin pale fingers lingered for a while.
On their way back, they touched Thomas’s cheek, leaving a red
trace, then his cheek flushed all over, then his face, even his
neck went crimson. Isosnezhda felt her own cheeks and ears glowing
too. Fortunately, the latter were hidden by hair.</p>

<p>“Stand up, valiant Northman,” she said in a
different voice, trying her best in pulling herself together. “The
help offered by hero is a great honor to me, weak and helpless
woman. You are right. I’ll speak to my warriors!”</p>

<p>Thomas stood up, his broad shoulders hanging
over her. He seemed as huge as a rock, his blue eyes went dark.
“Let me speak to them myself,” he asked hoarsely.</p>

<p>Three more riders came into the valley by the
road from city. Two of them supported the third one who was
bandaged hastily and spattered with blood. All the three had plates
of their armor cut and bent. One had a broken arrow stuck in
shoulder, but he kept supporting his friend manly.</p>

<p>Others ran to meet them, helped to dismount.
“What’s in the city?” Isosnezhda asked quickly.</p>

<p>“No more men of ours,” one of the newcomers
replied. “Pillage everywhere. They break houses, searching for
gold, destroy temples. They took chasubles from the Christian
church, tore golden settings off the icons. A score of barbarians,
with their chieftain at head, stormed into the magic tower.”</p>

<p>Thomas heard it, came running with a terrible
shout. “What? The tower?!”</p>

<p>The wounded men were laid down on the ground.
Women wiped their blood hastily with wet cloths. “They’ll destroy
it,” the warrior replied gloomily. “Someone set a rumor there’s a
treasure in basement. A big mob gathered. With picks, crowbars… Who
could think the magic tower can be captured?”</p>

<p>Thomas groaned bitterly. Isosnezhda looked at
his blackened face with sympathy, touched his breast tenderly.
“Thank you for your compassion, mighty warrior.”</p>

<p>Oleg came, jolly and wet like a seal, with
his hair plastered to the forehead. “The magician isn’t dead
still!” he said cheerfully from a distance. “While they believe he
hides a treasure, they won’t kill. They’ll only shake him a bit.
And the fool of him will finally see the difference between us and
those barbarians!”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head with disapproval. “Sir
wonderer, we should rescue the old man. It’s cruel to leave the old
to desecration.”</p>

<p>Oleg hemmed. He looked at the knight, then at
the queen. She blushed under his gaze but raised her small nose
with pride and straightened up, though her back was straight
before. “And save the kingdom while we’re about it?” he asked
Thomas. “Oh, Thomas. a good knight of Christ’s host… A knight of
Anglic dream! All right, but you see to everyone having a rest and
a hearty meal. Meanwhile, those in the city will get drunk enough
to crawl on their fours…”</p>

<p>The queen looked at him with disgust. “You
are a companion of the noble knight. Otherwise, I would not
tolerate your abominable words. Men will take a rest if they can
but any food will stick in their throats! Back in the city, their
families are <emphasis>dying</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>“That will make them angrier,” Oleg said
sadly.</p>

<p>The sun touched the tops of distant hills
when Isosnezhda, on her white horse, rode into the middle of the
camp. The folly shifted her chiseled legs nervously. Isosnezhda
raised her hand. The wide sleeve slipped down, baring the white
skin, never exposed to direct sunlight. “Warriors of glorious
Merefa! Our beautiful city is taken by foes. If we retreat, we
shall have no future. Now our families are destroyed, our beloved
raped, our children thrown into fire! There will be no more
Merefans if we leave. All of us will be chased like wild beasts. We
shall die all, perish with no fame. But the gods heard us. They
sent two great warriors to our aid. Though both are Franks, but, as
you see, even their far North can sometimes, at the will of gods,
born heroes to serve our great nation! These two Franks have slain
two monsters and drove away the third one. They will lead us for
the battle if we find enough strength to follow them!”</p>

<p>Thomas towered on his huge black stallion,
like an iron mountain riding the stone one. He also jerked up his
arm that looked like an iron-bound log for knocking castle gates
away. “Warriors of Merefa!” he roared in a thunderous voice. “I
speak as a professional warrior, a veteran to many battles. Believe
my great experience: the best time for attack is now! Their bellies
are heavy with food, their minds befuddled with wine, and instead
of swords, they carry bags of plunder, as they can’t trust each
other. They are dispersed in the city: the biggest parties number
no more than five or six men, as that’s enough to break the
strongest gate. Though their total number is much larger than ours,
but we Franks win wars by no numbers but skill. I advise you to try
it too.”</p>

<p>Three hundred warriors volunteered to go with
the iron knight, whose superiority was recognized unreservedly even
by Tilak and other generals. Determined to win or die, the party
burst into the city through the broken gate. Just as Thomas had
predicted, there were no guards on the gate, nor in the streets.
Dead bodies were everywhere. Narrow streets and alleys were
encumbered with the furniture and dishes thrown out of the windows.
In some places they saw houses on fire, heard terrible howls of
dogs. Sometimes they bumped into barbarians loaded with loot and
slashed them on the go: Thomas was leading his party to the
palace.</p>

<p>At full tilt, shaking the earth and the city
with thunder of hooves, they rushed to the palace square. Drunken,
befuddled barbarians started to drop out of houses. Those who got
onto the way of the galloping party fell down, with their heads
cleaved, or simply trampled by hooves: the knight did not allow to
stop and muddle in fights.</p>

<p>Thomas galloped at the head, bending to the
stallion’s neck, his long lance looking for a prey. Two grim guards
rushed after him, glancing at the mighty Frank without former
aversion. He slew monstrous spiders, killed many barbarians and was
now leading Merefans to save their own city!</p>

<p>A short skirmish broke out at the entrance to
the square: they bumped into a small party of newcomer barbarians.
Thomas left some of his soldiers to the fight and galloped to the
palace with the rest.</p>

<p>One guard cried out, pointed at the windows
with anger. Thomas saw human figures darting there above: only few
had furry caps of barbarians on. “The treasurer?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“In person,” the guard uttered fiercely. The
knuckles of his fingers gripping the sword hilt went white. “And
his traitors!”</p>

<p>“He’s yours,” Thomas allowed. “Tilak,
surround the palace! Let no bloody dog slip out.”</p>

<p>The warriors dashed into the wide open gate
with blood-curdling screams, galloped ahorse up the broad marble
stairs. In a brief fight at the door, they crushed the defenders
and burst into.</p>

<p>Thomas followed the red cloaks with approving
eyes. “They went wild… Good! And I thought no people in the world
are as strong as we, Angles… Do you think they’ll cope?”</p>

<p>Oleg moved his shoulders. “I always thought
so.”</p>

<p>“Oh, sir wonderer…” Thomas said, upset.</p>

<p>At once, they turned their horses and rode by
a narrow street to a smaller square, with the skyscraping magic
tower on its edge. “Can you open the gate again?” Thomas asked
tensely.</p>

<p>“It’s easier now,” Oleg assured him.</p>

<p>Thomas looked into the wonderer’s tranquil
face with suspicion. “Why? Do you have stronger herbs?”</p>

<p>“No. The tower has no gate anymore.”</p>

<p>At full tilt, they stormed into the tower
through the gap. Steel horseshoes rang against the broken iron
door. On the stone floor inside, the clatter became dry and
muffled. The furniture had been reduced to scorched splinters, the
walls speared through in search of hidings. There was a strong
smell of burning. The magician’s servants lay dead on the
stairs.</p>

<p>Thomas vaulted off and ran upstairs. His iron
soles banged on the floor, he breathed heavily and swore. Oleg also
left his horse, rushed after the iron champion of justice. Three
barbarians dashed towards them. Thomas was ready. He slew two of
them with mighty blows, and the third fell with a knife hilt in his
eye. Thomas jumped over him, darted into the room. Oleg pulled the
knife out of the bloody socket, wiped it thoroughly, tucked into
the cover on his go. The sword was dangling on his back, reminding
importunately of itself, but Oleg hoped he would not have to
unsheathe it soon.</p>

<p>The strange room probably belonged to the
magician. It was crammed with magic things, the floor strewn with
pieces of broken glass and crockery, scraps of clothes and old
books and manuscripts. The naked magician was crucified violently
on the wooden wall. His wrinkled senile body bore huge swollen
blisters and black charred places where his flesh had been burnt
with hot iron.</p>

<p>Thomas hastened to cut the bounds and put the
magician carefully down onto the bed. Oleg covered the old man’s
tortured body sympathetically with a cloak bearing comets and
Cabalist sigils. “Do you hear me, magician?” Thomas called
insistently. “It’s we again! Franks!”</p>

<p>The magician’s eyelids flickered but his eyes
remained closed. “The same… I tell… nothing…” his dry lips
whispered.</p>

<p>“We are friends!” Thomas cried more loudly.
“We don’t need your dribbling treasures! Even those in the base of
your tower!”</p>

<p>Oleg came out onto the observation desk,
shouted from here, “Tell him we drove away the enemies! Those who
were roasting him like a quail!”</p>

<p>The magician listened. “Foes still in city…”
he said in a faint voice. “I feel… Drive them away, then…”</p>

<p>“Fool!” Thomas yelled in a helpless fury.
“<emphasis>This</emphasis> is your gratitude?”</p>

<p>The magician opened his eyes, senile and
lackluster, with effort, whispered in a choking voice, “You can
torment me, burn, tear with pincers… I say… nothing…”</p>

<p>Thomas clenched his fists, gritted his teeth.
His eyes narrowed until they turned into slits flashing with blue
lightnings. Suddenly, a wide palm fell on his shoulder, a mighty
voice roared in his very ear, “Let’s go! The old man takes
stubbornness for persistence. Worse, he takes it for being
steadfast. Let’s get back to the sub… to our soldiers.”</p>

<p>“He’s <emphasis>a magician</emphasis>!” Thomas cried in
angry astonishment. “Why doesn’t he understand?”</p>

<p>“A magician. So what? A skill to make spells
does not make one smart or kind. Or simply good!”</p>

<p>Oleg pulled the furious knight out into the
hall downstairs, where their frightened horses strolled among the
broken furniture. Thomas took a running jump into the saddle,
imitating Oleg. His stallion reeled, moved his legs apart.</p>

<p>Shoulder to shoulder, they galloped out of
the tower and across the evening square. On the far side of it,
some houses were blazing, crimson smoke went high into the
darkening sky where the first stars had emerged. Shouts and clang
of steel were heard from the palace.</p>

<p>A crowd of drunken barbarians was coming
towards them from the plundered market. They made much noise, cried
out wild songs. Many of them carried sacks or were dripping with
necklaces they’d torn off women, small pockets in their wide belts
filled to burst with coins. At the sight of two huge riders, the
robbers who walked ahead got sober in a flash, their hands gripped
saber hilts.</p>

<p>“A timely meeting,” Thomas gasped out with
great relief. “Without it, I’d have exploded with rage!”</p>

<p>Oleg sighed, looked at the enraged knight
askew with his sad green eye, adjusted his quiver with a move of
shoulder: that put the feathered ends of arrows just beneath his
fingertips. <emphasis>I hate to kill even animals and birds but have to
send sharp iron into live men.</emphasis></p>

<p>With a roar of fury, Thomas burst into the
middle of the crowd, trampling over the first rows. His long sword
glittered scarily in the glow of fires, red with both the fires and
fresh blood. The barbarians surrounded him, screaming wildly.
Thomas cleared the space around himself with three violent blows,
flung his stallion ahead, leaving the slashed corpses behind. He
roared with laughter, his destrier snorted, knocked with hooves,
kicked and bit, as though infected with the rage of his rider.</p>

<p>Thrice Oleg drew the bowstring, but Thomas
slashed with such a fury that barbarians crumbled like wooden
chips. The darts they threw from a distance slid on his armor with
no harm done. An arrow hit it with a ringing click, broke into
splinters. Paying no heed to saber blows, Thomas span in the
saddle, as though on hot coals, his sword seemed to slice in all
directions at once. The air was full with rattles, shouts
interrupted on half a sigh, and terrible crunch of crushed
bones.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 20</p>

<p>Once the fighting was over, Tilak ordered to
fix the city gate and post guards on it. Then he selected soldiers
to ride with him all over the city, in search of hiding barbarians.
As he saw two mighty Franks riding towards him, he squealed with
joy.</p>

<p>“The Queen sent her bodyguards to find you,”
Tilak told them. “She had a sudden feeling as though you’ve left
us! I’ve rummaged half of the city myself!”</p>

<p>“We were in another half,” Thomas grunted. He
seemed to have just come out of shambles. Even his horse was bathed
in blood, and his saddle was soaked with it: thick and dark,
looking black in the light of fires.</p>

<p>The northern barbarian in wolf skin by the
knight’s side was clean but, judging by his face, he’d also been
killing. Besides, his quiver was empty and his sword on his back,
in northern way, as if he would like never to see it again.</p>

<p>“Isosnezhda told to invite you to the feast,”
Tilak said solemnly. “To celebrate the victory over barbarians. The
two of you are the greatest heroes! Especially you, sir iron
knight!”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head dismissively. “We have
to visit the great magician first.”</p>

<p>“Haven’t I told you?” Tilak exclaimed in
surprise. “Barbarians had been to the tower once again before they
fled. They burnt it down, destroyed all, cut the magician into
pieces… Nothing remained there but burnt walls!”</p>

<p>Thomas watched Tilak in stupefaction. The
knight did not seem to fathom what had happened. His jaw dropped,
reins slipped out of his numb fingers. His stallion stepped aside,
Thomas came to himself and turned to the leader of Merefans. “How…
How that happened? How could he allow to be killed?”</p>

<p>Tilak shrugged, and the wonderer spoke in a
gentle voice, “Stop rending your brave heart, Sir Thomas. You lost
nothing. What could you be foretold by a magician who failed to see
his own destiny? When <emphasis>we</emphasis> grasped the whole thing of it, he
kept balking like a senile ass of Bagdad. Only once had he got the
right thing: when he decided not to bully us…”</p>

<p>They turned their horses slowly, rode to the
palace, white in the dark of the night. The lights were on, and not
the ones cast by fires: soldiers hurried to light the remaining
lamps, drive torches into walls in places. They were cleaning the
halls hastily, pulling tables together, in preparation of the
triumphal feast.</p>

<p>Near the palace, their horses were taken and
led running to the tethering post. Thomas and Oleg waited, shifting
their feet. Tilak led the way up the broad marble stairs, which
were still blood-stained. The survived locals dragged corpses away
hastily, searching their pockets to return what barbarians had
robbed them of.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back at Tilak anxiously. “How
long are your feasts? Not a week long, I hope?”</p>

<p>“A good feast is a long one,” Tilak replied
with dignity.</p>

<p>“Then I’d prefer a bad feast,” Thomas
decided. “Sir wonderer and I have a long way ahead!”</p>

<p>Tilak gasped, stopped at the middle of the
stairs, his eyes as huge as dishes for celebratory meal. “Sir noble
crusader! At these very moments, a <emphasis>throne</emphasis> chair is put in
place for you! Have we missed a thing?”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, glanced over at the wonderer.
Oleg grinned, evidently amused by the knight’s confusion. “But…
Isosnezhda is a fair ruler, isn’t she?” Thomas asked Tilak hastily,
angry with himself for being embarrassed.</p>

<p>Tilak nodded, keeping his astonished eyes on
Thomas. His voice grew stricter. “Her father died last year, and
her mother perished five years ago in fire. And now the Queen has
lost the only relative whom she trusted: the wicked treasurer was
her cousin once removed! Our kingdom needs a strong hand, sir.
Isosnezhda has our loyalty… and our love, but we, her faithful
warriors, would like a strong man on the throne beside her. I’ve
heard the talks of my soldiers today… Forgive my insolence, sir,
but they spoke of <emphasis>you</emphasis> as our ruler!”</p>

<p>“I will not infringe upon the queen’s
sovereign rights,” Thomas told him with dignity. “I am Thomas
Malton of Gisland, a crusader of Christ’s hosts, a man of my word
and honor!”</p>

<p>Tilak advanced his open palms. “Sir, we’ll do
all of it by ourselves!” he tried to persuade. “Today the assembly
of generals will proclaim you the king. We believe you’ll treat
beautiful Isosnezhda kindly. You can marry her. If she tries to
refuse you, then we, her generals, will threat to turn against her.
We’ll force her, urge her!”</p>

<p>Thomas hummed and hawed and lifted his hands.
Oleg took mercy on him, clapped both Thomas and Tilak on shoulders,
and the three of them entered the royal palace. Thomas was greeted
with joyful shouts. People came running from the other side of the
palace to see him, and they who had fought side by side with him,
in those valiant three hundreds, pointed proudly at him, their
leader who swept dirty barbarians away as the wind sweeps dry
leaves!</p>

<p>In the great hall, men were taking their
seats. Servants were running off their feet, bringing food and wine
to the palace from looted shops and stocks. Isosnezhda saw the
mighty figures of northern warriors from a distance and beamed at
once. Her radiant eyes shone like morning stars.</p>

<p>Thomas got his legs stuck to the floor. While
he bowed to the radiant queen at a distance, keeping his eyes on
her and forcing a broad smile, he whispered desperately to Oleg,
“Sir wonderer. You’ve been to caves, you’ve spoken to gods… though
Pagan, but gods all the same… Could you please speak to the queen?
Explain her that my soul belongs to other lady?”</p>

<p>“And have her scratching my eyes out? I’m no
fool. I’ve seen her nails… And she also has teeth, as sharp as a
shark’s.”</p>

<p>“But she’s <emphasis>a queen</emphasis>! No plain
woman…”</p>

<p>“She’s looking at you like a woman, no queen.
Sort it out yourself, I want no part. You shouldn’t have smiled to
her. All of them treat it as a marriage proposal!”</p>

<p>The feast turned out to be also a war and
state counsel, an assembly of generals, a resumption of oaths. The
losses were great, and the faces of warriors at the table gloomy.
Wine flowed like water, but one or another general would have his
teeth gritted with fury and a silver cup crushed in his hand,
spilling the wine over the festal tablecloth.</p>

<p>The frightened chieftains of neighbor tribes
hurried to send their heirs or young daughters as hostages and
swear their loyalty on a sword, a fire, or a black dog’s entrails.
The heirs were placed, once they had come, in a stone outhouse in
the garden, under a vigilant watch.</p>

<p>While the chieftains said their oaths,
Thomas, in full armor, stood behind the young queen’s throne. He
was fearsome, his eyes glittered menacingly. With a metal clink, he
flung his huge gauntleted hand on the hilt of the giant two-handed
sword. The barbarians who managed to leave the city alive had time
to bring their tribes a word of that terrible insatiable blade.</p>

<p>Oleg sat at the far table with ordinary
soldiers, drank enough for three and ate enough for five. His
merriment looked unnatural. Thomas glanced at him with envy: the
wonderer kept a low profile, following, as he had explained, the
common way of his people, so he was not praised as a hero but he
also got none of the concerns Thomas was drowning in, like in a
teacup. Oleg spoke unhurriedly to Tilak, sparing Thomas that
unpleasant talk, and arranged he would prepare horses for them, see
to the remounts loaded with blankets, wine, meat and oats, and
then, at dawn, lead remounts and destriers from the stables
straight to the marble stairs of the palace.</p>

<p>The feast lasted all the night long. Thomas
got out to his horse just from the table. The beautiful Isosnezhda
came out to see him off: that extended Thomas’s torments. Her large
blue eyes were full of tears, a begging look in them, her lower lip
quivering. She did not trust herself to speak, only touched the
knight’s chest gently with her delicate fingers, keeping her eyes
on him. As she raised her face, he saw her tears dammed in the
lakes of eyes.</p>

<p>When Oleg reminded Thomas impatiently, in
half a voice, that one should not prolong suffering, neither own
nor those of others, Thomas clenched his teeth and mounted
abruptly. As the stallion felt his master’s mood, he gave a heavy
sigh, cast a reproachful look at the queen.</p>

<p>“Farewell, my wonderful knight from a fairy
land,” the young queen said in a rustling, barely audible voice.
“Don’t forget: your kingdom is here. It shall always be waiting for
you! I will keep my maidenhood to the end of my days. Whenever you
resolve to come, your throne will be waiting. I’ve put your
gauntlet and your dagger on the seat. They will stay there until
you come and take them… and sit on the throne if you wish. No other
man shall ever sit on it.”</p>

<p>“And you?” Thomas forced out.</p>

<p>“Me?” Isosnezhda smiled sadly. “I shall rule
in your name. A queen waiting for her powerful defender to come
back.”</p>

<p>Oleg grasped the reins of Thomas’s stallion
with his strong hand, gave a loud whoop. The horses galloped
straight away, their steel shoes thundered on the ground. The road
rushed to meet them in fright, threw itself under the hooves,
slipped beneath them in a flash, to sigh with relief and come to
itself behind the riders.</p>

<p>The horses rushed in a heavy gallop until
they got steamy. Oleg never glanced back. When the white city walls
hid behind green hills, he allowed the tired horses to take a slow
pace, then heaved a sigh. “Well, a glove and a dagger – not big
loss indeed. Though certainly a pity. I hope you left your old
gauntlet? The spare one you had in your bag?”</p>

<p>Thomas straightened up with insult. “Sir
wonderer!” he said with pain. “How <emphasis>can</emphasis> you? At this
moment…”</p>

<p>Oleg hemmed with disapproval. His eyes
remained inquiring.</p>

<p>“An old one,” Thomas confessed reluctantly.
“But the dagger was new!”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded. As he shifted his attention to
the road ahead, his eyebrows met at the bridge of his nose. Thomas
felt awkward when he understood that his caring friend was thinking
where on their way to buy a three-edged narrow dagger to replace
that one, and also a couple of spare gauntlets, made of mail rings
and topped with plates of steel, as those iron gloves are the most
frequently broken pieces of armor…</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas asked with confusion,
“please don’t tell anyone we fought spiders, or I’ll be mocked at
home. They won’t get it. Fools.”</p>

<p>There were about forty versts from Merefa to
the coast of Black Sea. They set out at dawn and had a brief rest
in the torrid afternoon. Oleg hoped to reach the sea by evening. If
their luck was good, the next morning they could be sailing a ship:
one of thousands plying along the coast, never taking a risk to go
too far from the land. This way, along the shore, they would get to
Constantinople in several days and part there. The noble sire
knight would take the northwest road, through Serbia, Croatia,
states of German and kingdoms of Frank to his Britain, while the
way of Oleg the wonderer lay to the north, across the dangerous
lands roamed by mounted hordes of Pechenegs, Kumans and other
people of steppes…</p>

<p>Thomas still rode in his full armor, even in
his helmet, enduring the heat and steaming, though within scores of
miles around there was not a soul and, in places, no bush, only
grass too low to hide a hare. Seldom they came across villages and
rode past, with their noses turned up proudly: Merefans had kindly
provided them with food and money enough for a year.</p>

<p>Even the slightest memory of Merefa made the
knight’s face dark. Oleg, feeling pity for his friend, would hurry
to amuse him with true occurrences and funny incidents of the lives
of kings and heroes. He knew lots of such stories, and Thomas began
to listen involuntarily.</p>

<p>Once their road came to a big city, which was
being flooded with immense crowds of pilgrims. A grand temple
towered majestically above the city, in the very center. <emphasis>The
city has grown around the temple</emphasis>, Thomas grasped. The temple
was surrounded by noisy caravansaries. Thousands of pilgrims moved
in a never-ending chain, by three or four men in a row, to offer
their worship to the Eternal Fire.</p>

<p>“It looks like that fire is really
cleansing,” Thomas said with respect.</p>

<p>“It cleans no damned thing,” Oleg replied
angrily. “Let’s go. Ride on!”</p>

<p>“Wait,” Thomas asked him. “I want a look at
it.”</p>

<p>“No,” Oleg said hastily. He turned his face
away as if that fire were burning his eyes. “We must hurry!”</p>

<p>Thomas nodded. “Your words are sweet like
honey to my faithful Christian heart. Probably, you’re not a lost
man. You can be brought into the bosom of the Church… on a good
chain, surely. And there your mean soul shall be saved with a
trifling penance imposed on you… for some couple of thousand years.
But why are you so sure that Pagan fire cleans nothing? The Lord,
in his unfathomable mercy, could allow…”</p>

<p>Oleg dropped his head, turned away, hiding
his eyes, like a devil would turn from a holy crucifix. When he
spoke, he sounded broken, his voice full of strange guilt and even
repentance. “What if some muddler, a trainee sorcerer, a botching
one, had lit that fire but failed to put it out? And here it burns…
a reminder of his folly. And people… are just people.
Everywhere.”</p>

<p>“Really?” Thomas doubted. “Could such a
muddler be? That’s no muddler, that’s… I don’t even know who!”</p>

<p>“He could do it by accident!” Oleg
snapped.</p>

<p>Thomas clenched his gauntleted fist. “For
such a botch, I…”</p>

<p>Oleg heaved a sigh. Thomas looked around
arrogantly. A big city that grew around the wonderful fire for
centuries is noisy and boiling, a swaying sea of humans: bright and
colored, loudmouthed and cheerful. <emphasis>They are men, though
infidel.</emphasis> Thomas did not want all his enemies to be idiots, as
that meant himself a match for them.</p>

<p>“Though there were woods then,” Oleg said
suddenly, with strange melancholy. “Wild woods. And marshes
everywhere. No sky to see, and miasmas… Let’s ride faster!”</p>

<p>At noon, when the scorching sun was bending
them down to the ground, Oleg, bathing in sweat, pointed silently
at two oaks that grew near a small stream. Like any trees in the
open, they had matured with no hindrance and grew stout. Their
thick branches could hide from sun or rain a big party – or a whole
caravan with its camels, donkeys, and goods. Thomas’s stallion, who
had been looking at Oleg with hope for a long time, turned after
him eagerly before the knight touched his reins.</p>

<p>They were in no more than hundred steps to
the oaks when a strange ragged figure came running up the slope on
its fours from the stream. Shrieking shrilly, the creature fell,
then got up to its hind legs, staggered two steps and fell again,
just under the tree.</p>

<p>After it, a big animal darted out, so
enormous that it took Thomas some time to recognize a bear. He ran
in no hurry, the hair on his paws and belly matted, as if he was
just fishing in the stream, its mouth full of sharp white teeth.
The strange creature turned out to be a girl with tousled filthy
hair. She pressed her back against the trunk, terrified, as she
watched the animal rushing to her.</p>

<p>“Our Lady!” Thomas cried and lowered his
visor. His stallion broke into gallop as usual. The bear gave a
roar, and the destrier, though he’d been storming the Tower of
David, went trembling in a broad arc to round the wild beast.</p>

<p>Thomas swore, hurled his lance on the ground,
gripped his sword, and vaulted off. The stallion tried to gallop
away, Oleg rode after it and managed to catch the frightened
animal. Thomas, with bare sword in hand, ran to the bear who stood
upright before the screaming girl, colossal on its hind paws, while
its forepaws stretched out, as though in delight.</p>

<p>Seeing that he would be late, Thomas yelled,
threw the sword with all his might, using it as a dart for the
first time in life. The sword flew, whirling in the air, hit the
bear flatwise on his back. The animal (he’d already seized its
prey) recoiled with surprise at the sudden strike of heavy sword.
The girl shrank back with a scream, her bare shoulders in bloody
marks of the bear’s claws.</p>

<p>The bear wheeled round to his offender. It
was no young bear who knew nothing of dogs and men: that one had
evidently met hunters, knew the sharp pain of flying arrows and
piercing spears. He uttered a terrible roar, which shook the air
and the ground, but did not dash ahead in blind fury. Instead, he
looked his enemy over with bloodshot eyes, searching for the
glitter of bitter biting blade.</p>

<p>Thomas felt his back creepy – and regretted
acutely he had neither a spear to spin the animal nor his huge
two-handed sword. <emphasis>Here it lies!</emphasis> Under the bear’s thick paw,
half pressed into the earth. His hands were empty, and the animal
was gigantic, as he’d never seen before.</p>

<p>In two steps on the ground, there was a long
pole with a charred and sharpened end. Thomas took a grip on its
smooth wood before he grasped it was a spear: a primitive one made
by a savage who’d burnt its end in the fire to harden it!</p>

<p>The bear sank to his fours, started coming to
the knight slowly, carefully. His red eyes blazed with malice,
sharp teeth glittered. Thomas, adapting to the simple weapon, kept
its sharp end down, low to the ground. His cousin once removed died
of wounds he received when a bear, half as large as that one, had
ducked under his steel spear.</p>

<p>Thomas muttered a curse. Assuming the risk to
be taken unarmed by the bear’s sudden attack, he lunged quickly,
jabbed the forepaws, both of them, with the charred end. He hoped
to make the animal rise on its hind paws. <emphasis>That will be a chance
to thrust the sharp pole in his heart.</emphasis></p>

<p>The beast gave a terrible roar but did not
stand up. In a flash, he snatched the pole with his large mouth,
shook his head. Thomas screamed with pain: his arms were all but
torn off the joints. He heard a crunch and saw a broken piece,
shorter than an axe helve, in his hand.</p>

<p><emphasis>Ridiculous</emphasis>, a thought flashed in his
head. <emphasis>To fight and win on the walls of Jerusalem, take the Tower
of David by storm, survive in dozens of battles… and die of a
forest animal’s paw?</emphasis></p>

<p>He cast a frightened glance around in search
of the wonderer. Oleg had just seized the reins of the knight’s
horse, in half a mile from the fight. “Run!” Thomas cried to the
girl. She watched him with eyes goggled in terror. “Run, fool! To
that man with two horses!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, the bear stood up. Thomas strained
his shoulders, stretched his arms out. A great heaviness came down
on him, as though a mountain collapsed, his throat cramped with
noisome breath. He felt his spine cracking, his vertebrae bursting,
his ears were ringing of the deafening roar. The bear kept crushing
and breaking, the steel armor caved in. The air burst out of
Thomas’s chest with rattling, his ribs brushed painfully against
each other.</p>

<p>They took a firm stand, grappling each
another, but Thomas only tried, without success, to join his
fingers on the animal’s broad back, while the roaring bear clawed
the steel plates of his armor. There was terrible grinding, as
strong claws broke, like fish scales under a knife, steel pieces
fell to the ground, claws stuck into the small rings of mail.
Thomas twisted with pain: the bear’s long claws reached him through
the thick sweater, dug into the muscle on his back.</p>

<p>He stopped trying to join his fingers in the
lock – the bear was too broad – but squeezed the animal with all
his might. His breath rattled, the bear roared, growled, and spat.
Thomas got weaker, pressed with the last of his strength. Suddenly
the bear loosened his grip, tried to release himself, to push the
iron knight away. Thomas pressed on, surprised at keeping his feet
still. The bear’s mighty roar turned into squealing, doggish whine.
The beast wriggled, tried to push free again. Thomas took a deep
breath and a tighter grapple on the bear (he now seemed smaller)
and squeezed him with all the force he could gather. He heard a
crunch under his arms, then a gurgle. A warm liquid rained down on
his helmet, poured over his eyes.</p>

<p>Thomas released his grapple, stepped away
quickly. Blood came gushing from the huge jaws hanging over him.
The eyes of the colossal bear, as red as coals, died out. The
animal collapsed on his back, the ground shook. Thick paws gave a
twitch and stretched out.</p>

<p>The girl was sitting under the tree with
terrified expression on her dirty, soiled face.</p>

<p>The wonderer was leading unhurriedly the
destrier with moving ears. He glanced Thomas over with disapproval.
“You always get dirty as a pig… Get into the stream, or you’ll fail
to rip it off when it dries.”</p>

<p>Thomas breathed heavily, with rattling and
piercing within his chest at every deep breath. He had no strength
to reply. He only turned his head to the stream but did not trust
himself to walk there, in fear that his weakened legs fail him.</p>

<p>Oleg dismounted, came to the girl. She moved
aside in fright, her eyes still full with horror. “Silly you,” Oleg
persuaded. “It’s not <emphasis>me</emphasis> you should be afraid of, but that
man in his iron shell. His heart is also shelled, I warn you!.. Let
me adjust your leg. It got crooked all over.”</p>

<p>He felt her ankle, took it in both hands,
kneaded, stretched, then moved it abruptly. The girl gave a thin
squeak, like a small animal in its burrow, but even Thomas grasped
at once that there was no displacement anymore, only a slight pain
that would pass in a day or two.</p>

<p>Thomas dragged his feet to the stream, doing
his best to keep a serene face and not to limp. The bank moved
under his iron boots, he fell and slipped down on his back into the
ice-cold water, raising a sparkling spray of water. The stream was
small: his feet reached the other side, while his head remained on
this one. Cold water flowed among the pieces of armor, soaked his
knitted clothing, cooled his bruised body. Thomas felt like a solid
bruise with protruding broken ribs and jagged fragments of
bones.</p>

<p>He lay in the stream, chilled but enduring,
though his teeth chattered. The sun was scorching and ruthless, the
torrid heat made flies drop dead. Should one slip out from under a
leaf, it snatched something in a flash of mica wings and hid again
at once. The grass on the bank shrank and lay down in exhaustion,
despite its roots reaching the ice-cold water.</p>

<p>He heard a strong voice above. “Sir Thomas!
It’s no good. We have guests, and you keep fishing! Have you caught
many?”</p>

<p>Thomas heard the voices of others. Earth
crumbled under his iron elbows until he managed to stand up in the
middle of the stream, With water spurting out of all the slits in
his armor, he looked like a fountain in the royal palace. He felt a
move in his bosom, put a hand there involuntarily. When he took it
out, there was a small silvery fish jumping on his palm, with red
fins and angry goggled eyes. Stunned, Thomas unclenched his
fingers, and the fish leaped into the stream with a gurgle.</p>

<p>“That’s for half a day?” Oleg accused. “Oh…
You meet the guests.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>“They crave for you.”</p>

<p>On the bank, three tents had appeared under
the trees. People bustled about them. By the road, a whole string
of decrepit carts was coming, pulled by docile horses and loaded
with poor chattels, followed by some gaunt, ragged, almost unarmed
pedestrians.</p>

<p>A stocky shaggy man, in a torn shirt and some
old pants, stepped ahead to meet Thomas. The man had a short sword
with wooden hilt on his rope belt. He was followed by two men of
even poorer and plainer looks and the girl whom he’d rescued. Now
she had a clean face, a burning red flower in her combed dark hair.
She was all eyes watching Thomas, while whispering something
briskly to the men.</p>

<p>The shaggy man gave Thomas a bow. “I’m a
chieftain of the tribe. My name is Samoth. This is my grand-niece,
lazy and sly, but we love our people and want no one dead… Thank
you, mighty warrior! Please honor us by your presence. Be our
guest.”</p>

<p>Thomas lifted his hands in dismay, glanced
back at Oleg, seeking support. “Thank you. We’d like to, but we
must go.”</p>

<p>“To the sea?” the chieftain asked.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“And then? Constantinople?”</p>

<p>Thomas got surprised and anxious. “How do you
know?”</p>

<p>“Everyone goes to Constantinople,” the
chieftain replied calmly. “All the roads in the world go through
this capital city. You are Frank. You came here through
Constantinople – and have no way to escape it in your return.”</p>

<p>“True,” Thomas admitted. “But I have no time
to lose.”</p>

<p>Samoth turned round to his assistants for a
quick counsel, then spoke to the knight again. “If you leave today,
you’ll stay ashore till next noon. There are no ports along this
road, and the ship of Gelong – he’s my blood! – will not leave
until holiday.”</p>

<p>“Which holiday?” Thomas asked.</p>

<p>“Of the Great Fish that saved our land,”
Samoth answered solemnly.</p>

<p>Thomas opened his mouth to tell what he
thought of Pagan customs but bit his tongue as he caught the
wonderer’s mocking glance. <emphasis>Let them have their rites. These
people will be christened by someone who has more time and less
concerns.</emphasis></p>

<p>“Thank you,” he replied, frowning. “But
tomorrow we set out at dawn. What’s the name of your relative whom
you mentioned?”</p>

<p>“Gelong. We’ll write him you are a friend of
ours, and he’ll do his best to make your journey pleasant.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at their rags, gaunt faces,
bare feet. “You can read and write?” he said with doubt.</p>

<p>The chieftain laughed, baring his yellow
dented teeth. “All of us can! Only two nations in the world have to
be literate to please their gods: we, great Uryupins, and those,
what’s their… some Jews.”</p>

<p>People put their carts in a ring and
stretched chains between them. As Thomas was explained, it was
their protection against sudden attacks of brigands whom the roads
and caravan ways, in the aftermaths of the war, were swarmed with.
In the middle of the cart ring, they made fires, put up two scores
of tents, poor and dirty, made of skin patches and old blankets.
They cooked floury soup in caldrons over the fire, baked edible
roots on coals. Thomas put out the meat and dainties that Merefans
had given them for the trip and laughed, as he saw the eyes of
children and adults widen with delight.</p>

<p>The rescued girl, her name was Iguanda, kept
at Thomas’s side, watching him with loving eyes. Oleg smirked. A
grand-niece, as he had calculated on his fingers, was a rather high
degree of kinship on the maternal line (Uryupins and Jews used to
count kinship that way). <emphasis>These people are poor, but they can be
robbed of nothing. They look happy. What does a man need
else?</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas was angry: he was left to drowning in
a teacup again while the wonderer stayed apart, sitting by the
fire, drinking sour wine with Uryupins, listening to their stories.
<emphasis>Like water off a duck’s back!</emphasis> The Uryupins asked Thomas
simple-mindedly whether he, a mighty warrior, was to join them.
“Iguanda will marry you if you ask well. In due time, you can
become a chieftain if you memorize all our customs!”</p>

<p>Irritated by those talks, Thomas stood up and
walked away, around the camp. As a war professional, he noticed how
the carts were put and arms disposed.</p>

<p>In the middle of the camp, he saw some
ancient ruins almost buried in sand. He felt them, told the
wonderer with surprise, “Looks like there had once been a
sanctuary. Or even a capital city! These ragged men could have been
an ancient and wise nation, like Chaldeans, but gone wild, couldn’t
they? But what power could destroy these walls? They are of granite
slabs, not burnt clay!”</p>

<p>“What a difference,” Oleg muttered.</p>

<p>“Big,” Thomas objected. “Once a blunder like
that began such a… Saracens say Iblis was an angel who refused to
bow to Adam. ‘You made me of fire and him of earth,’ he told God
and was chucked down, head over heels, from the heaven. And what
came of it? Since that time, Iblis hates men and keeps doing harm
to them. You must remember what that damned one did to us!”</p>

<p>Oleg was surprised. “You are Christian! How
can Iblis harm you? He’s a devil of Muslims!”</p>

<p>“How can he?” Thomas was insulted. It seemed
to him that the wonderer suspected him in cowardice. “Just like
Satan and his! He <emphasis>is</emphasis> Iblis, Devil, Beelzebub, Shaitan, Loki,
Lucifer… I’m no prelate to know all his names!” He waved aside and
went back to the nomads.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced with interest at Thomas taking a
drinking bowl from the chieftain’s hands, saying something,
touching his heart, then his forehead before he drunk from the
bowl.</p>

<p>When there were two of them again, Oleg asked
venomously, “Won’t you get it hot?”</p>

<p>“From whom?” Thomas wondered.</p>

<p>“From the god of yours.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“For your bowing, I dare say, to the god of
others.”</p>

<p>Thomas gave him a patronizing look, replied
in a condescending voice. “Sir wonderer… you know much but not
everything. Probably you haven’t travelled enough. A single god… a
single face of God, I mean, is known to those who have never got
off their stove, as you’d say. And I have been to many… And I know:
when God comes to a new land, He, to be better understood, speaks
their tongue, puts on their clothes, or even adopts a local name!
Different people have different ways. Let them have it, if only
those are ways of goodness, knightly valor, and justice. I know
that we call the name of Christ, the Saracen – of Allah, some other
people – of Buddha… but we call the same God! Besides, I don’t bow.
I just salute to the Supreme Lord.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 21</p>

<p>When the sky began to go dark, fires were lit
even outside the defensive ring of carts. Camels and horses were
grazed and guarded on the other side of the stream, while people
had a poor but merry feast in the middle of the camp.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg pleaded tiredness and went
into the tent allocated to them. Thomas took off his armor with
relief, wanted to put his two-handed sword into a corner, but there
were no corners, so he put it in the head of the bed, following the
wonderer’s example. Oleg stripped off, lay down with enjoyment. “A
ship tomorrow! I love sea. Though my people know mostly steppes, as
they previously knew woods… Or maybe the sea laps in the blood of
Slavs?”</p>

<p>“There’s only wine that laps in my head,”
Thomas moaned. “How would they mount camels?”</p>

<p>“You can grip at the camel’s humps. But if
you fall, the way down is longer!”</p>

<p>Thomas collapsed on the bed, tossed and
turned for a while. He started to snore when the curtain was
removed silently and Samoth entered the tent. The chieftain’s face
was confused, he fiddled with his shirt torn on the breast. “Excuse
me, dear guests, for I bother you, but we have news. Riders came
from the Great Sultan.”</p>

<p>Thomas alerted, felt the bag with the cup in
the head of his bed. Oleg said nothing, looked at the chieftain
searchingly.</p>

<p>“They say two extremely dangerous outlaws
have managed an escape from his prison.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” Thomas hurried him up.</p>

<p>“They described the appearance and
distinctive marks of… Of the two of you.”</p>

<p>Thomas tensed and pulled his sword closer.
“What did you tell them?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>“What I could? But one of mine told them at
once that both men whose marks fit are in our camp. As our guests.
And the riders demanded us to give you up!”</p>

<p>“Come,” Thomas urged him on.</p>

<p>Samoth put his hand in his bosom, scratched
himself there, caught something and squeezed in his strong nails.
“I don’t think they came from Sultan,” he said in a dull voice.</p>

<p>“Why?” Thomas asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Sultan would not demand of those who are not
his subjects. Neither his tributaries. Uryupins submit to no one!
We are a free nation.” He burst with laughter, threw out his thin
chest proudly. Thomas kept his hand on the sword hilt, glanced
around, listened, looking sideways at Oleg. “I exposed them at
once. And they had to confess they came from afar but not from the
Sultan. They said you were condemned to be quartered in Persia,
burnt in India, buried alive in Moesia, lapidated in Judea,
crucified in Constantinople… And to something in other places I
don’t recall. Guilty of corruption of minors, sacrilege, incest,
destruction of the temple of Silul…”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head. “I’d need more than
one life to do all of it! Maybe the wonderer did? He’s older and
has been everywhere.”</p>

<p>Oleg thought for a while, scratched the back
of his head warily. “Have I ever ruined the temple of Silul? At
that time, I was on the other end of Lanka!”</p>

<p>The chieftain nodded with relief. “I knew
they were exaggerating. Besides, preventing men from leading the
life they want is none of our concerns. We never interfere the
rites of others. Our gods put it clearly: you shall not
impede!”</p>

<p>“Did they leave?” Thomas asked in a
constrained voice. He kept his sword.</p>

<p>“They told us the reward for your heads.
Stated in rupees, dinars, guldens, golden rings, ostrich feathers,
ivory bone, even in some kunas… A sack of gold for each of you, to
put it shortly.”</p>

<p>They felt a cold blow in the close hot air
within the tent. A man would kill easily for a coin, even no gold
one. <emphasis>And here are two sacks of gold flung out lightly by some
powerful one who wants the work done with utmost care and
complaisance.</emphasis></p>

<p>“The Seven?” Thomas said, gasping for air.
Oleg nodded. “What did you decide?” Thomas asked Samoth in a heavy
voice.</p>

<p>The chieftain looked aside, his face
embarrassed. “Such important matters… when all the tribe is
concerned… I should discuss with the elder. Even with all of my
people.” He backed out from the tent.</p>

<p>Thomas jumped, straight from the bed, to a
small window in canvas. It was filmed with yellow ox bladder. He
saw adult Uryupins crowded at the far end of the camp, arguing
lively. The sky was dark, studded with stars, but the Uryupins were
lit by crimson flames, which made their faces look even more sulky
and cruel. Men disappeared to come back with weapons. Due to some
strange custom (or simply poverty), they wore swords and daggers
unsheathed. Bare steel blades looked particularly ominous in the
red light of fires.</p>

<p>“A sack of gold…” the wonderer drawled
thoughtfully. “May we come out to them?”</p>

<p>Suddenly, Thomas gasped, his face went white.
He looked through the dim film with terror, as though he saw a
ghost. Oleg seized the sword, jumped up to his side.</p>

<p>Two well-clad warriors came out from a far
tent and walked up to the cluster of arguing ragged men. One was
broad-shouldered, remarkable by nothing but moving like a
professional soldier. Another was… Gorvel! He was emaciated, his
face maimed, a gaping wound in place of his left eye. Thomas did
not recognize the other knight at once: his fire red beard had gone
grey all over! Gorvel moved in the same brisk, predatory way,
looked over the crowd vigilantly with his one remaining eye. He was
clad in light armor: thin coat of mail down to his knees, his chest
and back covered with plates of best Damask steel – and belted with
a Khazar sword.</p>

<p>There were shouts in the crowd, but Thomas
could not hear the words. After the false envoys of Sultan (and
true ones of Secret Seven), Samoth the chieftain came out of the
tent. He raised his arms to calm the men down, cried at the top of
his voice and lungs, bending his chest forward, red with
overstrain, “Men of the free nation of Uryupins! You know our
guests, the envoys of Sultan, made a long way. With the only
purpose to make us rich! Two sacks of gold for two heads of
strangers! We can buy a herd of camels for each Uryupin man,
luxurious tents and best food, slaves and carpets! A sack of gold
means the best sabers of Damask, rich shops in any city and lands
for us to buy… Think it over!”</p>

<p>“What will they do to them?” someone in the
back rows cried out.</p>

<p>Gorvel bowed and stepped forward, raised his
hand. He was almost a head taller than most Uryupins, and his
strong voice, the only thing that had not changed about him,
sounded imperious and stentorian. “We shall tie them up, for they
are dangerous outlaws, then tie them to the legs of our camels and
drag them behind as we ride. There’s sand everywhere, so they won’t
get smashed up. If they even gorge with hot sand on the way and
die, we don’t care! The Sultan told us to bring them, no matter
dead or alive.”</p>

<p>The chieftain lifted his hands. “The envoy of
Sultan, you’ve put it very understandable!” he approved.</p>

<p>Thomas came back to the bed, started to put
his armor on hastily, clicking with clasps and rustling with belts.
In those minutes, he grew more pinched than after fighting the
bear. <emphasis>It is hard to fight men after you have enjoyed their
hospitality!</emphasis></p>

<p>A far voice of chieftain seemed to have
reached his ears. “Men of the tribe, now you know what to do…”</p>

<p>In a hurry, Thomas slapped his helmet on,
tightened the belt. Far from the tent, there was a happy roar of
hundreds of mighty throats, approaching and growing louder, mixed
with the trample of feet, merry squeals, clang of steel, as if
someone was hitting his shield feelingly by the sword hilt.</p>

<p>Oleg stood by the window, his face strange.
His lips stretched, as though to whistle. “Oh dear… Sir Thomas,
just look at it!”</p>

<p>Thomas snatched the sword and rushed up,
feeling the beastly strength back to his tired body. The sword
seemed stuck to his palm, his heart thumped with all its might,
forcing up fury for a fight.</p>

<p>Through the window, he saw a huge excited mob
coming towards their tent. Uryupins thrust clenched fists overhead,
raised swords, sabers, and plain sticks, two or three men swung
ropes. In the very middle of the crowd, there were Gorvel and his
assistant: stripped off their armor and helmets, tied up tightly,
their clothes torn. People spat and flung clods of mud at the them
as they walked. Gorvel’s face was covered with blood, his grey
beard matted into a puny goatee, his front teeth missing. His
assistant had large swollen bruises under his eyes.</p>

<p>They were dragged past the tent, in which
Thomas and Oleg stayed put. One of the carts was removed to throw
the captives outside the camp. Men came running up with two fast
annoyed camels. The mob yelled, bustled, and hooted. The captives
were flung down on the ground, tied with long ropes to the camels.
In a hurry, the broad-shouldered soldier was tied to both camels at
once: his left leg to one and his right to another. The mob roared
with laughter and cheers. In the turmoil, someone fetched the
camels a stick. The animals gave a hollow roar, raised their hind
legs and ran, dragging the captives. There was a tree in hundred
steps ahead. With disgust and horror, Thomas saw the camels running
apart to pass on both sides of the tree!</p>

<p>He turned away at the very last moment,
gritted his teeth, closed his eyes tightly. Gorvel was dragged by a
single camel, but the way was rocks, snags, and dry clods of earth,
and the humpbacked runner kept accelerating his speed, in fright of
his master who was running with shrill screams.</p>

<p>Thomas gave a jump when a heavy hand fell on
his shoulder. The wonderer forced the knight to turn his back,
started to unclasp his armor. Oleg’s face looked made of stone.
“<emphasis>They</emphasis> offered it themselves!”</p>

<p>“Yes, but…”</p>

<p>“Who comes for wool is at risk of getting
shorn. Strip off, quickly! When the chieftain comes, you’ll burn
with shame.”</p>

<p>“I <emphasis>am</emphasis> burning!”</p>

<p>“To be honest, I also have, as Christians put
it, sinned in my mind.”</p>

<p>Thomas dropped the pieces of armor in a
haste, listening to the far shouts and rustling sounds of feet.
Through the window, they could see a dusty cloud moving away after
the running camels. Now Thomas knew what a fast speed racecamels
could gather. “Every man would be dead in two hundred steps… In two
miles the last!”</p>

<p>“I hope he would,” Oleg said, frowning. “Last
time I left him to death but allowed a chance… A tiny one! But he
used it! Or… someone helped him.”</p>

<p>Thomas recalled Gorvel’s maimed face, empty
socket, grey beard. “The Secret Seven?”</p>

<p>“Someone of their nearest.”</p>

<p>“Do they have magic?” Thomas asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“Many things can be done without it,” Oleg
evaded.</p>

<p>Thomas’s face turned stone. “I see,” he said
slowly, as though rolling heavy stones at the same time. “But if
they have magic, why don’t they simply take the cup from us? What
am I against magic?”</p>

<p>Oleg was silent for a long while, with his
head down. Suddenly it seemed to Thomas that the wonderer’s
motionless face livened up a bit, his tired wrinkles smoothed. He
sounded exhausted but strong. “Once they wanted to lead the world
by the way of magic… And fought apostates: the knowers. Fought them
fiercely, ruthlessly, but their strength was fading. When the
supreme magician, the head of Secret Seven, great Fagim perished in
fight with… er… one of the apostate knowers, the remaining Secret
Ones turned to knowing. Since that time, knowing is often called
science…”</p>

<p>“They gave up magic?!” Thomas exclaimed with
delight.</p>

<p>Oleg smirked unkindly, feasting his eyes on
the beautiful knight with his sky blue eyes. “Gave up… for others.
For the mankind! That was what I strove for. But they retained
magic for own use.”</p>

<p>Thomas felt creepy, as he noticed the strange
slip. He shivered. “Will they… use it?”</p>

<p>“To take the cup? Yes, if other ways to get
it fail them,” Oleg replied thoughtfully. “If they have an urgent
need to do it. <emphasis>Urgent!</emphasis> That will make them break their own
rules. But I can’t fathom <emphasis>why</emphasis> do they need it?”</p>

<p>He peered intently in the side where the dust
cloud had vanished in the night. His fists were clenched, knuckles
white. Thomas did not dare to ask what exactly the wonderer had
striven for and why he spoke in such a way as though he’d fought
the invincible Secret Ones before.</p>

<p>Early in the next morning, they parted with
the hospitable Uryupins. Thomas couldn’t help confessing and
begging pardon for the sin he’d committed in his mind.</p>

<p>The chieftain smirked, made a broad gesture,
as if to embrace all of his people. “Why do you think we are that
poor? Just because we are honest! But all the gold on earth is no
match for the magic gold my people have in their souls. Why would
we sell honor and conscience for two sacks of plain gold?”</p>

<p>They embraced at parting. Thomas whipped his
stallion hastily: he could not bear to see the accusing brown eyes
of Iguanda. If now he saved her, he should have taken her. She
would rather be eaten by the bear than by sorrow for the mysterious
knight from the far North…</p>

<p>When the tribe was left far behind and the
horses took a slow pace, Thomas pounded his thigh with his metal
fist several times, while speaking in a tone of persuasion. “There
are men in this world! There are. Even in the bloody and
treacherous Pagan world. <emphasis>There are!</emphasis>”</p>

<p>Oleg smirked. “Have you doubted it? Your god
didn’t sacrifice his life in vain, did he? He must have also
thought there were men in the world. Though everyone was Pagan
then!”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing, unwilling to keep the
conversation up. This Pagan’s words often smelled of mockery even
when he spoke very seriously.</p>

<p>Oleg was frowning. He would often glance at
the sand under the horse hooves or look around. For some reason, he
made a semicircle and, once the sand dunes hid him from view,
whipped his horse and dashed on like a whirlwind. Astonished,
Thomas could barely keep up. But the wonderer did nothing in vain,
so Thomas drew out his sword.</p>

<p>They saw three mounted men who rode hastily,
watching the tracks on the sand. Thomas saw the hoof prints of
their horses from a distance. His fury boiled up, like water in a
bowl on red-hot coals. “Damn it!” he said fiercely. “Would we ever
get rid of spies?”</p>

<p>Before the wonderer could give a signal,
Thomas gripped his sword and, with a terrible yell, dashed onto the
riders. They were too busy with the tracks buried quickly by sand
and wind, so they failed to hear the knight’s furious shout at
once. When they looked back, shrieked and started to urge their
horses, it was too late. A destrier can develop a colossal speed
within a short distance. He came up with the back horse, hit it
with own body, toppling the rider into the sand. The second rider
was reached by Thomas’s sword: a flat side of it, but the blow sent
the man flying like a useless old pot thrown away.</p>

<p>The third one spurred his horse. He would
have escaped, but Thomas heard helplessly a ringing blow of iron on
iron. The rider jerked his hands up, jumped in his saddle and
collapsed on the ground. His helmet, knocked down by the arrow,
fell on the other side of the horse.</p>

<p>“We got you, crows!” Thomas yelled with
gloat. He saw a dark shadow, some likeness of a ghostly bat,
sweeping over one man. Thomas was sure that was a devil taking the
soul of the sinner, as the man had been slashed by sword from the
back of his head to the middle of spine.</p>

<p>They tied up the rest two, flung them into
the circle of the grass trampled by horses. Oleg lit the fire at
once, started to gather wood. He was sullen and thoughtful, red
hair falling on his forehead, inhuman green eyes looking with
enmity.</p>

<p>Thomas smiled contentedly. There’s no honor
in defeating the weak, but their captives look strong warriors. One
has malevolent sparkles in his eyes, his hands twitch, as he tests
the rope for strength. Another lies still like a snake in hide,
before it jumps. He seems capable of keeping silence even if
tortured.</p>

<p>Oleg brought an armful of twigs and muttered.
Thomas could not hear the words, but the twitching captive asked
anxiously, “What this savage wants?”</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged. “He asked whether it’s time
to eat you. I answered it’s too early.”</p>

<p>The captive let out a squeak and passed out.
The other one, who had been silent and motionless, begged in a
shaky voice, “Good sire, you are Christian… Please protect us!”</p>

<p>“No need,” Thomas comforted him. “He’s
forbidden by his Pagan faith to eat people under the rays of
all-seeing sun. He’s a fire worshipper!”</p>

<p>The captive went trembling all over, his head
tossed in fright. The great orange ball had passed zenith and was
rolling down with relief. The captive gave such a start that made
him bob. His face turned grey. “That means… we are safe till
evening only?”</p>

<p>“You are,” Thomas assured. He yawned and
stretched himself with joy, feeling his joints turn and crunch
faintly. “If only the sky is not covered with clouds… but that’s
rare in this land.”</p>

<p>The captive looked with terror over the
knight’s head, where a small cloud, as white and fluffy as a
kitten, sprang up and started to grow.</p>

<p>Oleg made the fire blaze up, fetched more
twigs. The captives saw him asking the knight of something and the
knight looking warily at the close hedge of thick bushes. “What he
wants now?” the captive asked hastily.</p>

<p>“He’s impatient. Says the cloud is too slow.
Asks me to help him to make a shelter of branches, so that he could
drag you there himself.”</p>

<p>The captive trembled. “I’m sure you won’t
help him.”</p>

<p>Thomas knitted his brows menacingly. “Do you
mean I’m an idler?”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t,” the man babbled in panics,
almost weeping, “but this savage…”</p>

<p>“He is my friend at arms,” Thomas replied
proudly. He got up with dignity. “Though a savage, he saved my life
more than once! You’ve shamed me when you pointed at my self-love
and laziness that don’t befit a noble knight. Certainly I should
help my companion… do him this small favor. After that, I shall
spend a couple of hours fishing at the bank. They say fish is
tender and delicious here! I’ll show you… Oh, I see. Well, it’s the
final destination of everyone.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>After that, nothing hampered their way to the
coast of Black Sea. The Greeks called it Pontus Euxine, which meant
“the hospitable sea”, or the inhospitable sea in other times. Many
other nations inhabiting its shores named it simply “the Russian
sea”, for its waves being crowded with Russian ships long since.
Ruses traded and robbed, carried goods and people by sea, made
plundering raids on the opposite coast, where local tribes,
nations, and states changed often. Russian pirates, forders, free
daredevils, Cossacks, and other brigand men gave their forays
oversea an ironic name of “going for winter coats.”</p>

<p>All the way Thomas neighed, as he recalled
the captives vying with each other in crying out everything they
knew, selling and betraying their masters, promising to be good
slaves, only to avoid their entrails being pulled out and devoured
for them to see… The wonderer rode silent and thoughtful: the
captives had told nothing worthy.</p>

<p>Easily, they found Gelong, the shipmaster. He
was fierce with hangover, shaggy and violent, his crew avoided him.
At first, he went barging on Thomas, being filled with bad blood, a
happy beast in presentiment of a good fight, but Oleg hurried to
interfere. He told Gelong they had come from Samoth, his blood, as
his best friends and comrades who’d been drinking with him the day
before – and the savage beast of a shipmaster changed to a beaming,
happy man who embraced both of them, clapped on shoulders. Then he
wheeled round to the trembling cook who was looking out from behind
a bundle of ropes, roared in a stentorian voice, “Wine to the
bottom cabin! Lots of wine!”</p>

<p>Thomas heaved a sigh. “We’ll be going along
the shore,” Oleg cheered him up. “If we get drunk, we’ll feel less
of the rolling, as our heads swing and our bellies gurgle…”</p>

<p>They had to sell the horses. There was hardly
enough space aboard for two men, and that they owed to Gelong’s
cordiality. Oleg praised Thomas for his wise deed, advised him to
keep saving all maidens from beasts, as all of his great
predecessors had done: Targitai, Perseus, Ivasik, Beowulf, Sigurd…
“They also used to receive a good reward. Sometimes a double one if
the girl contributed to it.” Thomas scowled and snarled. He was sad
of parting with his destrier, whom he’d stormed the Tower of David
and climbed the walls of Jerusalem with.</p>

<p>With bags on their backs, they came aboard.
At once, the sailors raised a fore-and-aft sail that was strange to
Thomas. <emphasis>In the northern seas, a sail is seldom in use. Rowing is
more relied upon, and if even they raise the sail, it is a straight
and square one.</emphasis> But the oars of Gelong’s ship were in disorder,
and her crew started drinking straight off. To be more exact, they
<emphasis>resumed</emphasis> doing it. Only three or four men kept a lazy eye on
the ship.</p>

<p>The wind was even, fresh and steady. In case
of need, sailors would turn the sail deftly: a skill not known to
Vikings. The master informed they would arrive to Constantinople,
the capital of Roman Empire, in a week. Thomas puffed up like a
little owl, ready to argue that <emphasis>Rome</emphasis> was the capital, but
Oleg intruded and took the conversation away from a slippery road.
In fact, the Great Roman Empire used to have two capitals, both
Rome and Constantinople, for a long time, and its sigil, the proud
eagle, was portrayed with two heads to transmit the idea of Empire
having a single body and two heads that would not live without each
another. The Western and the Eastern Roman emperors (the latter
often named basileus) did not make any difference, but the fact
that the single Christian Church had divided into the western and
the eastern branch did. That difference was still tiny but Oleg had
seen much of the world. He’d seen peoples who split amicably but
began terrible bloody wars two or three generations later.</p>

<p>Once, in a vague dream sent by either gods or
his soul who managed a look into the distant future, Oleg saw the
emblem of the Russian Empire: a two-headed eagle as a symbol of
Russian princes and, later, Russian tsars, but could not fathom how
that was possible. <emphasis>Will Rome come and capture Slavic lands? Or
will Russian hosts finally achieve the long-lasting dream of their
princes and take Tsargrad with its lands for themselves and their
children?</emphasis></p>

<p>They shared the cramped cabin under the steer
box with three more men: two merchants and a fat idle boy. Those
three would enter no conversations but turn away, hiding their
faces. They wore the clothing of common men but their faces and
hands were too white and well-groomed. Thomas winced, irritated by
the company of sleek traders (if those were traders). He spent most
of the daytime on deck, watching dolphins. Twice he saw the huge
oblique comb of a sea serpent, but it vanished before he could call
the wonderer.</p>

<p>Once a ghostly ship sailed by. The sailors
made much ado, shouting of a trouble brewing. Thomas moved away
with disgust, lest their sweaty unwashed bodies touch him in their
bustling about. In wars and travels, he had seen not only ghostly
ships but whole ghostly cities, not to mention castles, towers, and
minarets! And ghosts of caravans, oases, and lone men could be seen
in hot Arabia almost every day.</p>

<p>Oleg, attracted by the clamor, climbed on the
upper deck in haste. “What’s up?”</p>

<p>“A vision,” Thomas replied sarcastically.
“For all to see. But, unlike you, they neither exult not thank
gods. And what do <emphasis>you</emphasis> think? Can a vision do any harm?”</p>

<p>“Surely it can,” Oleg replied confidently.
“To another vision.”</p>

<p>“I see… But that’s a concern of theirs. Let
them fight each other as they like. But can they harm live
men?”</p>

<p>“Definitely! If live men get lost in
contemplation, treating it as a circus, and let their ship crash
into rocks or another ship.”</p>

<p>The ship sailed without letting the shore out
of sight. In times Thomas could make out the ruins of ancient
towers or remnants of old cities. That fertile land had seen many
nations and states changing each other. Thomas had heard, with half
an ear, only about the most powerful of them: the Hittite Kingdom,
Lidia, Midia, Ahmenids. There had been the empire of Alexander the
Great, then the Seleucids, the kingdom of Pontus, Pergamum, the
possessions of Romans and, at last, the state of Seljukids, which
was destroyed a year before by a mighty Crusader host from far
northern lands. <emphasis>Nations rise like flowers in spring, their
tongues get mixed with the remnants of previous ones and diluted,
then they fall under the pressure of some newcomers. Last year, the
warriors of Christ came here for the first time. Surrounded by
alien tribes, they hurry to raise strong castles and fortresses…
Will the Crusaders resist?</emphasis></p>

<p>All the way to Constantinople, the ship was
followed by dolphins who jumped in waves and looked with gleaming
curious eyes. The sailors told Thomas that dolphins had once been
men who went into the sea to avoid war and grief and live happily
ever after, with only a vague memory of kinship that attracts them
to people. Thomas tossed fish and slices of bread to dolphins,
thinking seriously of whether he would become a careless dolphin to
escape the bitter human life where a man had to take each step by
fight. He failed to resolve it at once, even as he recalled the
immortal mages following his tracks and the unknown traps waiting
ahead.</p>

<p>As the ship rounded a cape, some golden
sparkles flashed in the sun far ahead. Oleg heard Thomas sigh
loudly at his side. The knight’s face was excited. <emphasis>Those
gleaming sparkles are the domes of Christian temples, each one
covered with twenty or thirty poods of pure gold. And
Constantinople has thousands of such domes.</emphasis> The city was known
as Tsargrad to pirates and Varangians, to Artania, Slavia, Kujavia,
and then Kievan Rus’, Novgorod, to princedoms of Chernigov,,,</p>

<p><emphasis>Probably</emphasis>, Oleg thought with a thumping
heart, <emphasis>it is the oldest city in the world. All the caravan ways
pass here, through the joint of two giant continents: Europe and
Asia.</emphasis> Since long ago, there had been roaming tribes whose names
sank into oblivion. Each of them changed the name of the city,
which was burnt down, destroyed, and rebuilt again. Nations would
be born, get old and die, their tongues dying with them, but the
city kept standing on the bank of the channel, as she was needed to
everyone.</p>

<p>The place was visited by Hittites,
Macedonians, wild men of Pannonia, Italy, Scythia, Hyperborea.
Everyone who came from north had to follow the same path, which
their feet had trampled into a broad trodden road, and the one
walking from south had another path, but both of them were doomed
to meet here. <emphasis>By the will of gods, all roads follow the folds of
earth.</emphasis> At the cross of those two paths, a city emerged. It had
changed many names, but the first one to be remembered was the last
but one: Byzantium. When Constantine, the Roman emperor, was
looking for a place to build his new capital, he found no better
place than the ancient Byzantium, so the city was given a new name:
Constantinople, which meant “the city of Constantine.”</p>

<p>The Emperor had the city broadened
immediately. For a start, he blocked the neck of land between
Europe and Asia by a tall stone wall, then raised hundred and forty
large battle towers on it, to protect the wall, to house soldiers,
their weapons and provisions. The wall that fenced the new capital
off the sea was guarded by eighty more towers.</p>

<p>Inside the walls, Constantine built palaces,
fortresses, luxurious houses for high officials, massive barracks
for his imperial guard, sumptuous temples (those were then ruined
to raise churches, no less sumptuous, on their solid foundations),
high guest mansions and storehouses. He also built prisons and had
broad cellars dug under them: ordinary for plain prisoners, secret
for particularly dangerous ones, and the most secret for the
personal enemies of the Emperor. The secret torture chambers looked
at the bay, and dead bodies in sacks, with boulders tied to their
legs, were shook off into the water. Near the most secret torture
chambers, there were secret treasury rooms, also graded by
accessibility: the most important ones could only be visited by
Emperor himself.</p>

<p>During his last visit, Oleg had noticed how
thoroughly Constantine had been decorating the capital city, how
ruthlessly he ravaged his other lands, driving the best masters and
craftsmen together into the old Byzantium – and how fast Byzantium
was changing to majestic Constantinople, as polished slabs of
marble and basalt, statues of gods and heroes, centaurs and
chimeras had been brought there from all around.</p>

<p>Constantinople looked unassailable. The old
Byzantium had got shy and lost in the magnificence of the capital
city, turned into one of its quarters, neither the poorest nor the
richest one. <emphasis>It was Agnir for thousand years</emphasis>, Oleg thought
bitterly, <emphasis>and Kerch for the next thousand and Komonsk for the
following ten centuries and Byzantium for the same time and a bit
more. For a thousand of years till today, it has been known as
Constantinople.</emphasis></p>

<p>His shoulders flinched, as though of a sudden
blow of the cold northern wind. <emphasis>What name will it get for the
next ten centuries? Which nations will come to crush its present
inhabitants: New Greeks, a mixture of Slavic migrants and remnants
of neighboring savage tribes who took a proud name of Romans but
their neighbors call them Romays</emphasis><emphasis><sup>15</sup></emphasis>
<emphasis>and later will know them as Byzantines? Or the pointless
destruction of one nation by another will be stopped
someday?</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas watched closely the growing walls, his
eyes glittered with professional interest. “No one, for thousand
years, has taken this stronghold by storm… Have you been
inside?”</p>

<p>“I have,” Oleg replied. His voice sounded
strangely muffled. Thomas turned to him in surprise. Oleg nodded.
“Yes, I have been there! Both inside and outside.”</p>

<p>“I see a wonderer’s life is good,” Thomas
sighed. “You can get where a man with sword is not allowed.”</p>

<p>The wonderer’s face stiffened as if he tried
to recall something buried deep in his memory. Thomas did not dare
to break the silence: in times, the wonderer looked very
mysterious. The knight would take no notice of such trifles before
he’d been dragged by life across different countries, peoples, and
customs. Though that had only made the Christian hold in his soul
stronger, he learnt to feel the souls of others. <emphasis>Even the souls
doomed to Hell’s fires for their disbelief in Christ.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg came back from his brooding. “If the
Secret Seven keep their whim to get your cup, a man of theirs shall
be waiting in Constantinople,” he warned Thomas. “This gate from
Asia to Europe can be escaped by no one!”</p>

<p>“There are more people in Constantinople than
ants in a forest! We shall get lost to view.”</p>

<p>“We shan’t if they put a man at the
moorings.”</p>

<p>Thomas put his palm on the sword hilt. Oleg
knew it without looking back: hundreds of times had he seen this
gesture, habitual for Thomas in every trouble.</p>

<p>“Whom are you going to slash? There are lots
of people on the pier.”</p>

<p>“May we disguise?” Thomas suggested
warily.</p>

<p>Oleg gave a long look over his proud figure,
distinctive at any distance in his gleaming armor. “How?” he asked
with sullen irony.</p>

<p>“Er… I could, though I hate it, turn my
shield with other side as we go ashore. I can even put it into my
bag! We are searched by my arms: a sword and a lyre on starry
field, aren’t we? There’s no point changing it: The Secret Ones
should be experts in heraldry, as it is studied everywhere, first
of reading and writing, as the most important of sciences. So they
will know any move by the starry field of the shield, get the
meaning of it…”</p>

<p>“A good disguise,” Oleg approved, “but let’s
forget it. The Emperor has tens of thousands spies in his service.
They meet merchants, pilgrims, beggars, settlers, and sailors on
the city gates to ransack their belongings and levy a duty, but
their most important job – the one for which they get second salary
from a secret pocket – is to watch for the second face of they who
look plain merchants or beggars. For their <emphasis>true</emphasis> face. The
city is penetrated constantly by spies and scouts, assassins and
agents of remote kings or robber gangs. Almost all of them are got
to their bottom by sophisticated secret service men easily – but
they’re allowed into the city all the same, under a covert
supervision, to find out all of their links and aims and
accomplices. Often they’re allowed out of the city too, with no
harm done to them, if that serves some distant purpose of the
Empire. And those purposes can be more far-going and sinister than
the naive and straight-minded kings of young western realms can
even imagine!”</p>

<p>The ship dropped anchor in half a mile from
the shore. There were hundreds of other ships, large and small,
rocking on waves while new ships were coming and light fast boats
with strong-shouldered rowers bustled about.</p>

<p>Gelong waited patiently for a port official
to come by one of those boats. A stout man, but not a fat one, he
walked to the bridge, accompanied by the shipmaster. His mates
slipped into the holds, like nimble rats, to leave the two of them
in private. The official and the master studied the list of goods
thoroughly. The official marked some of them as forbidden. The
master started to argue, pointing out those things had been allowed
the last time, but the official remarked reasonably that even
mountains and seas change over time. His assistants came out to
collate the lists, and there was arguing again. Gelong was going
dark. When the assistants, all together, turned their backs, he
sighed and poured a handful of golden coins into the official’s
pocket. Thomas winced. <emphasis>The Empire is rotten through!</emphasis>
However, the duty became smaller at once and the official left,
while his assistant stayed aboard to serve as a pilot.</p>

<p>The ship approached the close mooring
cautiously, choosing her way among other ships. Thomas stood in his
full armor, feeling his sword. “A rotten place,” he said with
disapproval. “That’s a pity… It’s so beautiful! The Holy Bible says
of many kingdoms: Babylon, Nineveh, Assyria. Where are they now?
Once while crossing a desert, I saw some ruins of towers and
buildings in the sand. Sometime palaces had been rising there and
gardens growing and splendid birds singing… And I walked knee-deep
in hot sand, only deserts around, and almost squealed as a pig with
sorrow for the lost beauty. Though I knew the city must have been
inhabited by wicked Pagans, as it died thousands of years before
Christ!”</p>

<p>Oleg peered intently at the approaching
moorings crowded with people, carts, bright litters, horses in
sumptuous attires, guards with gleaming blades. “To save everything
means to leave no space for the new. You’d better watch no
beautiful towers but ugly people. Your arrival is already known to
all the spies of Seven.”</p>

<p>“Do you think they’ll try to take it straight
on the moorings?”</p>

<p>“Be ready,” Oleg advised. “I think this city
will make your greatest challenge.”</p>

<p>Thomas’s cheeks went white, his eyes lost
reverie and started running over the motley crowd. The ship edged
her way between high-sided galleys, a bridge was thrown to the
land. Thomas and Oleg were almost the first to come ashore:
straight after the merchants and strange young boy who, all the
three, were twisting with unfathomable fear.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 22</p>

<p>The taverns and brothels in the port are
swarmed with low-class spies who are paid an extra salary by
prefects, questers, komeses, praetors, or inquisitors – everyone
wants to know secrets. The secret messages are valued very much as
a foundation of any policy. Should a spy conceal, soften, or
distort even a bit of it, his poor lot is to be eaten by crabs at
the bottom of the Golden Bay. They would leave only a bare skeleton
with the stone tied to legs.</p>

<p>The higher class of spies would report to the
Emperor himself, allowed to him as they show a secret sign. There
were spies of double or triple subordination. But the most
sophisticated ones, as Thomas felt now, were servants to Secret
Seven first, and only then – to the Emperor and other rulers of
limited power.</p>

<p>Own spies were kept even by eunuchs, whom the
Emperor’s palace was stuffed with. Eunuchs were considered to be as
free of sin as angels: they had no sex, while Satan was thought of
as a man in his full strength, eager to visit women at hot southern
nights and doing it at every occasion. Oleg glanced askance at
gloomy Thomas, thinking with a jeer that was a weak point of
Christianity, a defect in it. <emphasis>Eunuchs inspire disgust. People
should better not be reminded that castrates are made in the image
and likeness of angels, or a common man will find the devil more
fathomable or even closer to himself.</emphasis></p>

<p>There were flagstones underfoot and houses of
grey stone, five or six floors tall, on both sides. They could not
see the end of the street. In places, it was crossed by other broad
roads. Every step ahead made Thomas shrink, so enormous was the
city, so rich in people so different that no one looked twice
neither at him nor at the wonderer in his open wolfskin jack, his
bare breast wide and bronzed.</p>

<p>People seemed to be loafing their time away,
though many were purposeful in their hurry, elbowing and cursing
passers-by. The noise and clamor made ears ringing. At the foot of
the thick stone walls, warmed up by morning sun, children were
crawling and playing. They chinked copper coins against the walls,
measured the way to them with their fingers stretched, quarreled
and scuffled in adult way: spitting in each other’s eyes and
shouting out who of them, noble Romays, was in truth a filthy
Greek, a dump Slav, or a mean Jew.</p>

<p>They often met beggars, cripples, sick men.
Once they bumped into a whole procession of ragged paupers who
moaned in different voices. Thomas felt sick at the sight of their
huge sores, dripping with pus and swarmed with flies. They turned
into another street. The wonderer seemed no stranger to the city:
as they went, he told Thomas the names of taverns, their prices,
ways, and food quality.</p>

<p>Thrice they crossed market squares, each big
enough to house the whole tribe of Herulians or Gepids. Merchants
reached for Thomas from their tents, adorned with gold and silk, or
from behind their counters heaped up with goods. He was invited,
persuaded, begged to buy, seized by armor, tucked things in
hands.</p>

<p>Stunned and tired, as though after a good
fight or a stormy night, they got to the coaching inns. For some
reason, Oleg passed by the first three, despite exhausted Thomas
tugging him by sleeve. Near the fourth inn, the wonderer stopped,
looked around closely, counted horses at the tethering pole but
dragged Thomas farther on. They only entered the gate of the sixth
inn on their way.</p>

<p>They had dinner in the tavern on the ground
floor, then went upstairs: their room was on the fifth. Oleg lay
down and lapsed into reflection, but Thomas stood by the window for
a long while, with enviable stamina, still in armor. “Even streets
here paved with flagstones! And so smoothly, one by one! And
people! As many as ants in a sunny day… after the rain.”</p>

<p>“The capital of the world,” Oleg grunted.</p>

<p>“Not to everybody,” Thomas told back at once,
with a faint note of jealousy. “For us, the capital of the world is
Rome.”</p>

<p>“And the mouth of Don… London, I mean? Does
it submit?”</p>

<p>“It’s a different thing.” Thomas was
insulted. “Rome is the capital of all the world save Britain.”</p>

<p>“Take care not to say this in Kiev,” Oleg
warned.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Kievins bow to no one but their gods.”</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing. The wonderer was a true
friend and a reliable companion in everything save faith. <emphasis>His
stupid Paganism.</emphasis> And he was a good company: never imposing his
opinion, never arguing, always immersed in own thoughts. He would
almost never begin a conversation. <emphasis>He seems to dwell in some
other world and come to this one only when called.</emphasis></p>

<p>The knight came to another window and
lingered, watching the huge tall towers that flanked the strait of
sea closely. “Is there a chain stretched between them? To block the
sea for night?”</p>

<p>“Only in hard times,” Oleg assured. “Now the
chain is at the bottom of the sea. But I feel its huge winches will
soon have to move… I remember times when the chain stayed up even
for daytime…”</p>

<p>He smiled to his far memories, while Thomas
wondered what the winches to stretch the monstrously thick chain
across the sea should be like. <emphasis>Each one as large as a mountain?
Which fairy smiths could have made such things?</emphasis></p>

<p>The wonderer lay on the bed on his back, his
eyes closed, as though in peaceful sleep, but his right hand
fingered the charms without stop, felt them, lingered at this or
that figure… Thomas turned grim. <emphasis>If the wonderer is right and
the cup is pursued by the Secret Seven Lords of the World, there is
hardly a chain to keep them away.</emphasis></p>

<p>In the evening, Thomas decided to visit the
crusader knights: there were two knightly orders that occupied a
whole quarter in Constantinople. Oleg winced but said nothing
against and went for supper alone. Before leaving the room, he
powdered the threshold with dust and put some hairs out of his
wolfskin into the door slit.</p>

<p>Thomas looked at the wonderer anxiously, came
back to the bed and put a dagger on his belt, in supplement to the
huge sword he had on his back. He was in full armor, but the city
streets were strolled by people of far stranger and odder looks:
from half-naked and all but naked slaves of southern lands to
northern islanders clad in furs.</p>

<p>Oleg sat at the corner table alone, trying to
keep all the room within eyesight. He saw men drinking and having
fun: hired warriors, small chieftains, of both far and close
tribes, who had come to sign peace pacts. Merchants and traders
were also there, feasting openly, but the flauntiest revelers were
unremarkable types, as grey as mice. They seemed unable to pose any
danger even to a chicken and taking care of nothing but themselves.
Oleg was the only one to see (and the innkeeper, probably, the only
to know) their true nature. Those men were a fear even to the
imperial generals, intrepid and hardened in many battles. They were
the spies of basileus.</p>

<p>“Are you bored, chieftain?” A young foxy girl
with bright make-up, in short frivolous dress with low neck, leaned
on his shoulder, pretending a stumble. With interest, both
professional and plain woman’s, she cast a keen glance over his
muscular body, bare shoulders.</p>

<p>Oleg clapped on her hand. <emphasis>Her tender white
skin knew no work.</emphasis> He nodded at the bench near him. “Sit down.
What will you drink?”</p>

<p>She sat down willingly, laughed, baring her
dazzling white teeth. “I see you have been to our sumptuous pigpen
before, chieftain?”</p>

<p>“You see?” Oleg was surprised.</p>

<p>“Of course I do! You neither gaped nor jumped
up to paw me straight away… As though you have known all of it for
ages.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been here before,” he confirmed. “By
the way, my name is Oleg.”</p>

<p>“And mine is Helen. I’m working here.”</p>

<p>“Do you have a good day today?”</p>

<p>She wrinkled her nose prettily. “Not really.
Clients are either poor or greedy or too… repulsive.”</p>

<p>He gave her a sharp glance. “Are you
capricious?”</p>

<p>She laughed merrily, screw up her eyes
archly. “It depends. If I have a chance, why not? In other cities,
one has to accept everyone, even drunken soldiers, and
Constantinople has thousand merchants a day coming through each of
her gates. I have had no one today and would like to start the day
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>Oleg waved for a servant who hurried up to
them with a jug of wine and two glasses. “You start a day when I
finish it,” he told Helen.</p>

<p>“I’m a night bird,” she said easily. “But I
hope this time you won’t finish it that early!”</p>

<p>He took a sip of wine. He had grasped the
concealed meaning of her arch words: the sinister one. He poured
her some wine, observing her manner to take a glass, touch its edge
with her lips, to sit and put her legs. At the same time, he said
her words again and again in his mind, making her voice softer and
louder, changing it to bass or descant. He felt something different
about her, other than the nature of a plain prostitute. She
constructed too correct sentences, her pronunciation was clear, she
was even too beautiful for a wench in such a place. <emphasis>Smart and
good-looking whores do not linger at harbor taverns, yielding to
drunken sailors on a pitch of rotten hay. They make their way up
fast, some of their sort have even become empresses, like the
peerless Theodora</emphasis><emphasis><sup>16</sup></emphasis><emphasis>. May this beauty
be just beginning her way?</emphasis></p>

<p>She chattered, plucked the tightest grapes
from big bunches, enjoyed her sharp clean teeth into a huge peach.
It sprinkled with juice, she laughed. Her eyes were shiny, her
cheeks had a natural high color under the rough layer of rouge.</p>

<p>When the jug of wine was half-empty (though
Helen drank very little of it), Oleg tossed a golden dinar on the
table and got up. “Let’s go?”</p>

<p>She rose to her feet lightly. “Why not?”</p>

<p>Oleg, tensed as though he was to plunge into
cold water, noticed a strange stealing look of the innkeeper and –
in the big motley crowd, gobbling and jabbering – two sullen
merchants who fell silent at once and moved their heads together to
follow Oleg and the girl with slanting glances.</p>

<p>They went up, the broad wooden stairs
squeaked. Oleg let Helen go first, as though to feast his eyes on
her seductive body and inflame his lust. He laughed loudly and
joked while watching the curves of her slender body, listening to
music of her moves, spotting her lithe muscle, well-hid by roundish
feminine shapes. Helen (he was no fool to think it was real name)
did not look a girl ascending from the very bottom to the bedroom
of basileus. <emphasis>She was evidently born atop, brought up under the
care of nurses, tutors, masseurs, doctors, and experts on the codes
of behavior of courtiers, small folk, and barbarian
chieftains.</emphasis></p>

<p>In his small room, she shot a quick glance at
the window, touched the hilt of the huge sword, which stood at the
corner near the head of the bed, with interest.</p>

<p>The window shutters were quivering, the cold
night air bursting into the room. Helen shivered. Oleg made a step
towards the window to close it. “Wait!” Helen cried briskly. “I
have a better idea!”</p>

<p>Smiling seductively and looking in his eyes,
she started to untie her broad silk girdle with deliberately slow
moves. Her plump ripe lips curved in a promising smile, her eyes
laughed. Oleg smiled back to her: he had grasped the whole thing of
it.</p>

<p>Helen came to the window and, with the same
slowed moves, tied her girdle on the hooks to prevent shutters from
flying open. Oleg feasted his eyes on her lissome body, slim waist,
wide hips seated on long slender legs – especially because she was
expecting such an intent look and fast breath from him.</p>

<p>“I think that will be better…” she said,
still smiling, as she turned to him. <emphasis>Even a fool who failed to
see her girdle can now have a good view of her figure in the lit
window.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg sat down on the edge of the bed, the one
closer to the door, to miss no rustle outside. Helen stood near the
window. “What have you been before, Helen?” he asked
peacefully.</p>

<p>Surprise flickered in her beautiful eyes. “Do
you want a talk?”</p>

<p>“Don’t <emphasis>you</emphasis>?”</p>

<p>“Surely I do! But I heard you, northern
guests, behave like beasts and bed a woman straight off!”</p>

<p>Oleg smiled. “Do you want me to prove the
opposite? To chat with you of philosophy all the night long?”</p>

<p>She burst with merry laughter. Her pretty
head jerked up, baring the beautiful white neck made for kisses.
“It would be a severe disappointment to me!”</p>

<p>“Come to me then,” Oleg called. “Let’s make
love and discuss philosophy in pauses… if there are any.”</p>

<p>She nodded, laughter still flickering in her
radiant eyes. Slowly, she stepped to Oleg and, standing in front of
him, started to strip off her dress. Oleg kept on his face the look
of admiration for her young slender body, but he was all on tips of
his ears. He heard wooden floor boards in the corridor creaking
louder and nearer.</p>

<p>Helen also heard it. Her smile grew broader,
her eyes opened wider, more seductively. She had her undershirt off
in hand and looked teasingly at him.</p>

<p>“Someone coming to the door!” Oleg told her
quickly. “Get behind that door, quickly!”</p>

<p>She opened her eyes wide. “What’s there?”</p>

<p>“A closet,” he replied impatiently. “A
crumpled space but you won’t spend much time in. Just until I get
rid of my friend and companion. It must be him.”</p>

<p>With an indignant look, she made her way to
the closet door, sniffing, moving her hips in a provocative way,
her undershirt still in hand. <emphasis>Like a marrowbone before the nose
of a dog who’s led to the knacker’s</emphasis>, Oleg thought/</p>

<p>She vanished behind the door. Oleg latched
the entrance, threw his cloak hastily on his bow and quiver,
fingered the hilts of knives.</p>

<p>There was a loud knock on the door. Oleg
hurried to spill wine over the table and scatter the remnants of
food. “What the devil there at night?” he shouted in a hoarse angry
voice.</p>

<p>“What night, dear?” a merry, cheerful male
voice cried back through the door.</p>

<p>Oleg walked to the door slowly, stamping and
dragging his feet. He dawdled with the latch, grumbled loudly,
posing as drunken barbarian. Standing in the corridor, there was a
stocky man in light armor tempered by winds and sea. He had a broad
smile on his face, his teeth white and shiny, but his eyes took in
the whole room at a glance over Oleg’s shoulder: the spilled wine,
picked bones, an amphora lying on its side and another one standing
on the windowsill.</p>

<p>Oleg stepped aside, reeled, asked the visitor
in with a broad gesture. The man entered eagerly, with his broad
smile. He was merry, full of strength and health, belted with a
short sword in ornate scabbard.</p>

<p>“I only have wine of Chios,” Oleg told him
hoarsely. “Would you?”</p>

<p>“I’d rather have mead,” the visitor replied
after a brief pause. “Or a gulp of beer.”</p>

<p>The barrel of dark beer was at the closet
where Thomas had thrust it. “Drink wine,” Oleg grunted. “It won’t
kill you. Or get out.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll have wine,” the guest agreed
easily. He swept the crumbs off the bench with disgust and sat down
at it. “My name is Fish. I’m a professional soldier, a mercenary. I
left the legion for a better job. Now, for instance, I’m at command
of three score of cutthroats who I chose myself. This house is
surrounded by them. Reckless lads – and skilled, which is more. I
know people, so I have picked the best men, believe it! As we are
paid high, that was no problem. They won’t let a fly out, not to
speak of you and your friend. By the way, where’s he?”</p>

<p>He cast a keen glance around, which stopped
on the closet door. Oleg scratched himself lazily, hemmed, as if he
had a difficulty to digest Fish’s words. Suddenly, his fist darted
ahead. Fish was incredibly fast: he managed to toss his head and,
at the same time, slap on the sword hilt loudly. Oleg’s fist sent
him flying across the room. In his fall, Fish smashed the table to
splinters with his back.</p>

<p>Oleg raised him by collar, flung onto the
bench. Fish was half-stunned. Oleg tied him up with the rope
prepared beforehand, took his sword and two hidden knives with
heavy ends.</p>

<p>Fish shook his head, coming to himself. His
tongue felt bleeding gums. “You knocked out my foretooth,
barbarian!”</p>

<p>“Don’t twitch,” Oleg muttered. “I could
strike you like a rabbit, between ears, no marks then. You can have
a golden tooth instead.”</p>

<p>“You are quick,” Fish remarked. His sharp
eyes searched the mighty figure of the barbarian who showed not a
trace of drunken sluggishness. “And strong. I’d hire you. For a
double salary. That’s really much!”</p>

<p>“I am hired already,” Oleg told him. “You
see, I didn’t want to smash your lips.”</p>

<p>“It’s what I’m paid for,” Fish said
philosophically. “But the inn is surrounded, as you know, and my
lads wait me back. With a reply.”</p>

<p>“Which?”</p>

<p>“The cup.”</p>

<p>“And we?”</p>

<p>“You pose no interest to our master,” Fish
told him with displeasure. “It’s none of my business, thus. The cup
is mine, and you may go to hell!”</p>

<p>Oleg frowned. The names of the supreme
magicians of Secret Seven flashed in gallop across his memory.
<emphasis>Veterans don’t count. It must be one of the fresh. The new
generation of Secret Seven can be cruel, much more brutal than the
elder, but they don’t kill without necessity. They would only kill
for business, not for vengeance or any other emotion.</emphasis> “Is your
true master waiting somewhere in the street?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>Fish spat a dark clot of blood at the floor,
felt his bleeding gums anxiously with the apex of his tongue again.
“The one who made an order. Whether true or not, it’s no concern of
ours, is it?”</p>

<p>Oleg moved the bench, with Fish tied to it,
closer to the window, for those in the street to see his head and
shoulders. Fisk looked derisively, grinned, baring his teeth. He
still had plenty of them, good and beautiful.</p>

<p>Oleg filled a cup with wine, held it out to
Fish. “Take it.”</p>

<p>Fish played his brows in surprise. “It seems
I have my hands tied. Who could have done it? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“I don’t force you to drink,” Oleg snapped,
“but take it. Your elbows are tied, but your fingers free. When the
door opens, let them see you sitting peacefully with a cup of wine
in hand!”</p>

<p>“Why would I hold a cup on my knee?”</p>

<p>“Because you are loaded full but still want
more of it.”</p>

<p>“It does look like me,” Fish agreed. “What if
I don’t take it?”</p>

<p>At once, Oleg set a knifepoint against his
right eye. “I’ll put out one of your eyes, then another, and
then…”</p>

<p>“Give me the cup,” Fish interrupted. “But
mind <emphasis>you</emphasis> will be in our hands then! The master has no
interest in you, but I feel like starting to have it myself… How do
you, barbarians of North, put it: a tooth for a tooth? So you
should better treat me with respect.”</p>

<p>Oleg listened to the steps in the corridor:
they sounded at the other end of it and died away soon. “You need
to take us first,” he reminded.</p>

<p>“I have the soldiers whom I passed the
Saracen war with!”</p>

<p>“What are Saracen as against Drevlyans? Think
you have seen no true war.” He smirked, baring his wolfish teeth,
and saw distrust in the mercenary’s face. Fish was holding the cup,
its long stem set on his thigh, his gaze shifted between the
window, with the silk girdle on it, and the door.</p>

<p>They had a short waiting before there were
resolute steps in the corridor, then the door flew open, as though
kicked, and clanged against the wall. Two men with bare swords
emerged at the doorway. When they stepped into the room and saw
Fish sitting in a casual pose, a cup of wine in hand, one said
something back over his shoulder. The third man entered, kicked the
door closed without looking back. He had a drawn crossbow in hands,
its metal pieces gleaming.</p>

<p>Fish sat with his back to the window, his
face was shaded. The two men came almost close to him when the
first of them gasped, wheeled round with raised sword to Oleg who
was sitting on the bed with a drowsy look. Oleg threw both knives
at once, with both hands. <emphasis>A difficult trick, but missing the aim
in five steps is more difficult.</emphasis> The next moment he ducked, as
though plunged into water: an iron arrow from the crossbow swished
over. He snatched the sword from the corner.</p>

<p>The crossbowman drew a saber. Oleg leapt over
the corpses, in a hurry to finish fighting as fast as possible. His
first blow was parried by a saber, which slipped deftly under his
arm: Oleg barely had time to recoil. Yelling, he landed a terrible
blow. The soldier dodged skillfully, but Oleg caught him at that:
the wonderer’s knee crunched into his lower jaw. The hireling
jumped, feeling the hash of teeth in his mouth. Oleg’s punch sent
him flying into the corner.</p>

<p>As Oleg took a breath, some strange feeling
made him duck. Some steel swished overhead, clanged on the sword he
held up. Blindly, he elbowed at the place where the enemy should
have been, heard a crunch and a sob, but strong fingers clasped at
his throat. Gasping for air, Oleg snatched the invisible enemy by
head and pulled, twisting his neck. A crunch, and fingers on his
throat went limp at once. Oleg wheeled round, released his grip on
the attacker.</p>

<p>The body that collapsed on the floor was
Fish: his legs still tied to the bench but the ropes on his arms
had been cut by a sharp blade. One of his soldiers was wriggling on
the floor, Oleg’s knife in his throat, a saber in hand. <emphasis>Dying,
he used it to cut the arms of his boss free.</emphasis></p>

<p>“You had good soldiers,” Oleg agreed,
breathing heavily. “But I didn’t want to kill you, fool!”</p>

<p>There were three corpses in the room, among
scattered things and broken fragments of the table and chairs. The
fourth man, if even he lived, would never taste again the manly joy
of picking bones, getting the sweet marrow out, spitting out such
tiny bony splinters that even a starving dog would not gnaw at
them.</p>

<p>Oleg picked the cup from the puddle of wine
and blood, shook it off and put on the windowsill. Suddenly he
heard a groan. A recollection made him dash to the locked closet. A
short iron tail of the crossbow bolt was stuck in the thick wooden
door, in the very middle of it, the oak board splintered with that
mighty strike. The tail was looking up, as if the bolt were shot
from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Helen!” Oleg cried anxiously. “It’s all
over!”</p>

<p>Hurriedly, he removed the bar, opened the
door. He felt it too heavy, that was wrong. Helen all but hung on
it: she was span with a bolt. Trying to miss not a single word, she
had pressed against the door. When the crossbowman pushed the
trigger, his iron bolt went, with a terrible force, through both
the dead wood and the live body made for kisses…</p>

<p>With disgust, Oleg looked over the room: it
was spilled over with blood and wine. Corpses, broken furniture…
The crossbowman did his best to pretend dead. Oleg heard his quiet
sigh behind when the young woman, bathed in hot blood, fell out
from the closet. <emphasis>A stinker. He grasped her life had been taken
by his hand… Though not his will.</emphasis></p>

<p>He threw the blanket off the bed, took his
strong lamellar bow, selected one of the three special arrows in
his quiver. That one was iron, more of a short spear than an arrow:
large as a dart and thick as a finger, with a head of tempered
steel. He rummaged in the bag for a thick rope of very durable
fabric: in that land, it was called silk. <emphasis>The worms who spin
these wonderful fibers must have a good appetite.</emphasis></p>

<p>He heard heavy steps behind the door, as if a
stone pillar were walking, then a strong cheerful voice. “Sir
wonderer, don’t sock on my head!”</p>

<p>Thomas stepped into the room, reeled and
shrunk back. His back slammed the door shut, his blue eyes widened.
“Sir wonderer!.. What’s that?”</p>

<p>“A different way of entertainment.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer…” Thomas said again. He twisted
his head round madly. “It’s not a monkish way! I mean, not a way of
men like you. You have more to do with prayers, fasts…”</p>

<p>“My prayers did for them,” Oleg grunted as he
tied the rope hastily to the arrow. “Be sure they’ll have a very
long fast! Even that one, who’s just acting a sham beetle…”</p>

<p>Thomas walked round the bodies with disgust,
on tiptoe, gripped the crossbowman’s neck, slapped on the back of
his head with other hand. There was a click. Oleg nodded with
approval: the punch with iron fist made the crossbowman’s soul pass
out of the body for some half an hour, enough time to get far
away.</p>

<p>“Four,” Thomas grumbled, “and the woman, poor
thing… You could earn a knighthood, sir wonderer! Though a noble
origin is required, you could figure out something. Find somebody
among your ancestors, as they do everywhere…”</p>

<p>“I’ll do without it,” Oleg replied, “but
thank you for the idea all the same. Prop up the door with beds. In
the closet, there’s a chest with stones. Drag it here!”</p>

<p>“Are we to hold a defense?” Thomas asked with
distrust.</p>

<p>“Yes. Like on the Tower of David.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t they all here?”</p>

<p>“More to come,” Oleg assured. “We must run,
sir knight.”</p>

<p>Thomas straightened up with pride, his armor
made a grating sound. “Sir wonderer, I ask you!” he snapped with
dignity. “A knight never runs.”</p>

<p>“Well, to retreat. To withdraw, if you like
it. We have to win, haven’t we?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes a fine death is worth more than a
puny victory!”</p>

<p>“It’s not the case,” Oleg assured and
tightened the knot. Thomas’s eyes goggled, his eyebrows flew up to
hid under the helmet. The arrow is giant, unbelievable, the rope
tied not on its end, where the feathering should be, but on its
middle where a circular furrow in iron is seen.</p>

<p>Oleg drew the bow with effort, Thomas saw the
bulging bumps of his monstrous muscle. For the first time, he
thought with doubt whether <emphasis>he</emphasis> could draw such a bow.
<emphasis>Fortunately I’m a knight and have nothing to do with this
inhuman weapon. My codex bounds me to be noble even to mortal
enemies.</emphasis> “Are we going to hunt elephants?”</p>

<p>Oleg did not reply. He sat down on the
windowsill, kicked the shutters open. Heavy steps were heard from
the corridor. Oleg smiled faintly: just in time. The thirty
cutthroats whom Fish had threatened him with were not in the street
at that moment but walking upstairs, searching the landings, and
the best ones coming up to the door…</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 23</p>

<p>Thomas barred the door, dragged the heavy
chest out with a thunder, sneezing of dust, , propped up the door
with it, piled up the broken fragments of the table, heavy banks
and chairs. Oleg laid the coiled rope on the broad windowsill next
to him. He smelled the dirty air below, heard a clatter of hooves
dying away. Across the wide street, there was a tall gloomy
building with lights in three of its guarded windows.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Judging by the knight’s face,
as grey as ashes, he grasped where his strange friend was going to
shoot a bolt. His weakened fingers unclenched, the sword all but
slipped out of the iron hand.</p>

<p>Oleg drew the bow string with force, aimed.
His face went crimson, his teeth flashed in a grimace of torment.
Thomas heard a ringing click against the leather glove: the
wonderer had put it on providently. The heavy bolt vanished, the
rope started to uncoil rapidly.</p>

<p>In perfect silence, both heard a barely
audible, distinct ringing sound of broken glass. At once, the
wonderer seized the end of the rope and pulled. There was a loud
knock on the door, an impatient hoarse shout. “Hey, Fish!..
Antonio, Opudalo!..”</p>

<p>Thomas took his sword with both hands, stood
near the door. The wonderer stretched the rope, tied its end
quickly to the hook that fastened the shutters to the windowsill.
They heard an impatient bang on the door. The bar cracked, the
heads of thick nails moved out of their sockets.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped off the windowsill, put on his
wide baldric with a huge sword hastily, snatched the bag. “Sir
Thomas! You first!”</p>

<p>Thomas was squatting at the side of the door,
his legs half-bent, as if in ride, his sword raised overhead. The
knight’s eyes were fixed on the bending board of the door, pieces
of dry paint and small splinters flying sideways from it. In the
corridor, there were harsh voices, clang of steel, trample of
heeled boots.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” Oleg called again in an angry
whisper, “even the Holy Virgin would have commanded retreat. Why
the hell she’d need a dead knight? She doesn’t know what to make of
him live! Your life’s worth less than a damned thing, I agree, but
who will take your cup to Britain then? I have no need of it. And
who will marry Krizhina?”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted his perplexed gaze between the
wonderer and the door shaking and bending like a sail. Oleg seized
him by elbow, dragged to the window. Thomas looked out and
recoiled, as though kicked by a horse between his eyes. The night
was pitch-dark, the lit end of the rope – so thin! – disappeared in
the creepy dark only seven feet below. <emphasis>A fathomless pit!</emphasis>
Several floors to fell down to the earth, and no soft grass below,
only the street paved tightly with stone slabs, a fool he was to
admire it the day before…</p>

<p>Oleg looked back angrily, as he heard the
heavy pounding. With a ringing sound, the bar flew out of hinges,
crashed down in the middle of the room. Oleg tore his belt off,
made Thomas climb on the windowsill, fastened the belt quickly on
both him and the rope. “Quick!” he hissed. “Or we’ll die, like
Sveys without butter…”</p>

<p>Thomas peered into the scary darkness with
fear. He had been standing on the brink of abyss before: on the
Tower of David, the tall wall of Jerusalem, but that was in a fury
of storm, a fever of battle… and in a sunny day, after all! His
muscle began to turn water, his knees bent, unable to bear the
weight of armor.</p>

<p>Oleg hurried him, pushed on his back. “Quick!
Move it! They’re breaking in!”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer… And you?”</p>

<p>“I’ll follow!”</p>

<p>Thomas hurried to climb down from the
windowsill, feeling his courage and manly strength back to him.
“Sir wonderer, I am insulted! The duty of any warrior, a knight in
particular, is to protect civilian people. And you are a priest,
though I hate your faith!”</p>

<p>The door was shaking. A crack emerged in it,
wide enough to drive a finger, but the heavy chest, with its edge
stuck in the hollow between the floor boards, prevented it from
flying open. Someone squeezed his fingers through the crack,
fumbled around in search of the obstacle to remove it. Oleg
snarled, grabbed Thomas with both arms.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” the knight protested in great
indignation, “I can’t leave you!”</p>

<p>With an angry groan, Oleg hurled him out
through the window. Terrified, Thomas felt falling into the black
abyss. He clutched convulsively at the rope, felt a forceful jerk
at his iron collar behind: the wonderer kept him from coming down
upon the thin rope with all his weight at once….</p>

<p>The last thing Thomas heard was a crack of
boards followed by triumphant screams of legionaries. He slid on,
suspended by his belt to the fine thread. It quivered, hardly able
to bear his weight. His thick gauntleted fingers slid, as though
soaped, on the smooth rope, which ringed like a tightly drawn
crossbow string. Thomas felt sick as he imagined the thread
bursting with a crack and him, a noble crusader knight in his
steel, collapsing from the height of the fifth floor on the stone
slabs, crunching against them like a lobster, his brain splashing
around…</p>

<p>In terror, he took a firmer grip and dragged
himself on into the darkness, along the invisible salutary thread,
his eyes burnt with sticky, disgustingly bitter sweat. Then he was
thunderstruck by a dreadful thought: was he moving in the right
direction? The turns and tugs before… He had to hurry: the rope was
too thin to endure two men. <emphasis>Sir wonderer is beating off the
legionaries who broke into the room! He may already be wounded or
killed. It’s all my fault!</emphasis></p>

<p>He howled with terror and impotence of a
noble Angle who felt lost in the night over a street in
Constantinople. <emphasis>Almost a barbarian city as compared to Rome.</emphasis>
He bowed his head, trying to see the wall of the house, but his
metal collar, made to protect the neck from swords, impeded to turn
it. He heard a patter of high heels far below, a playful woman’s
giggle answered by a deep-voiced laughter of a well-fed Romay.
Thomas swung over them, his head gurgling, as well as his stomach.
He imagined himself falling down before those strolling clods and
felt so sick he couldn’t help vomiting. Below, there were still
giggles, jokes, clatter of high heels. With the last of his
strength, Thomas dragged himself along the rope. Even if the
direction was wrong, he would help valiant sir wonderer in his last
mortal battle, instead of hanging on that damned rope like a dump
caterpillar in a spider’s web!</p>

<p>His body struck against a hard surface. He
felt it, found iron rods, wriggled to grip the salutary metal,
which the Romays used to guard their windows, with both hands. His
foot found a crack between the stone blocks that formed the house.
The heart beat frequently, thumping not on his ribs but on his iron
armor.</p>

<p>On the other side of the metal rods, , there
was a dark shape of thick iron bolt pressed tightly against them.
The stretched rope was tied to it! Thomas sobbed, leaving his
terror behind, muttered a slack curse for the wonderer who told him
nothing, gave no warning, so he was pursued all the way by the
vision of the arrowhead coming out of the wall and him, Thomas
Malton of Gisland, falling like a toad, with his limbs spread wide
apart, in the middle of the street… Foolishly, he thought the bolt
should have been stuck into the wall, and he could not imagine the
force needed to drive it so that to endure a big man in full
knightly armor!</p>

<p>Suddenly, the rope started to shake
violently. The figure of the wonderer emerged from the darkness,
running on a tightly stretched rope, as if it were a log, his
outstretched arms rocking from side to side, the two-handed sword
and stuffed bag in hands.</p>

<p>He took a running jump on the grating, clung
to it for a moment, the sword flashed and hid behind his back, the
bag shifted onto his shoulders. Thomas wanted to undo the belt that
fastened him to the rope but he dared not to release the rods. He
tried to drive away the very thought of him, an expert in jousting,
hanging on the wall on fifth floor, like a March cat, above the
stone-paved street.</p>

<p>A knife flashed in the wonderer’s hand, the
rope burst under the blade, fell into the dark. Across the street,
there was a shriek, then a heavy stroke on stone, as if a sack of
wet clay dropped on the pavement.</p>

<p>“What’s now?” Thomas asked in a scared
whisper. “Gnaw at the grating?”</p>

<p>“What are we to do in a woman’s bedroom?”
Oleg grimaced. “If there was the procurator’s daughter… but it’s
his granny! We’ll better get into the window below.”</p>

<p>“The procurator’s daughter is there?”</p>

<p>“Shame on you, Sir Thomas! Krizhina’s waiting
for you. Poor girl! If only she knew what you are dreaming of…”</p>

<p>He vanished in the dark. Thomas heard a
screech below, as if rust was scratched away, then an irritated
whisper. “Sir Thomas, wake up. Stop dreaming of the procurator’s
daughter!”</p>

<p>Thomas hung on the tips of his fingers and
toes, playing a spider. He was hot in his armor, like in the Hell’s
stove, his limbs trembling, numb fingers about to unclench.
Suddenly some hooked paw emerged from the darkness below, seized
him by leg. He all but fell off in panics, but managed to slide
down, with a support from below.</p>

<p>The wonderer was on the windowsill. He got a
better grip on the knight’s belt and dragged him, with a screech of
iron on iron, through the ruined grating: only the topmost and the
lowest of its horizontal rods were undamaged, while all the
vertical ones had either vanished or got terribly bent
sideways.</p>

<p>They collapsed into the dark room and
stiffened. The house was silent, save for muffled bangs on a copper
caldron far below, and a dog barking: an old and lazy one, judging
by the sound.</p>

<p>“The hirelings are now running upstairs,”
Thomas supposed. With effort, he got up to his shaking feet,
brought his trembling hands to his face. He felt cold and heavy in
stomach as if he’d swallowed a block of ice or a frozen sheatfish.
Meanwhile, Oleg ran about the room, stepping as silently as a giant
cat, touched the door, set it ajar to look out. A strip of crimson
light fell in from the corridor. They smelt smoke of a tar
torch.</p>

<p>“They don’t hear,” Oleg said. “First they
should guess where we are. I’ve cut the rope! Its end reaches the
ground. That’s what they see from the room – and think we’ve
climbed down the rope. And silence below, no shouts nor noise,
means their sentries have missed us, or we bribed them. While they
sort it out and whack the guilty ones, we can take a breath and get
away.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer, I’d rather get away without
taking a breath!”</p>

<p>“Is something up?” Oleg wondered.</p>

<p>“Yes. When you cut the rope, someone was
climbing it!”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head in astonishment. “Oh,
brave they are… You, sir knight, are a different pair of shoes: a
true hero. Another man like you can hardly be found in all the
Britain, and I can’t believe in more of such heroes found in two
thousand miles away… Well, you’re right. We must get away.”</p>

<p>Thomas felt flattered, even his legs stopped
trembling. Oleg opened the door wider, looked out and stepped
there. The sack on his back made him a likeness of a giant turtle,
and the sword hilt and the bow, sticking out on a level with his
ears, changed that into a scary creature of night.</p>

<p>Thomas slipped out after the wonderer,
glancing at him with shame<emphasis>. He took the larger part of our
common load again.</emphasis></p>

<p>They walked along the broad corridor lit by
oil lamps in copper bowls on the walls decorated with colored
panels, its floor of expensive marble with intricate patterns. On
both sides, there were massive doors of valuable sorts of wood,
with decorative carving, ornate copper handles, gleaming nails with
broad patterned heads. Behind one of them, they heard laughter,
merry voices of women. Oleg stopped there and listened – a hermit
indeed! – while Thomas all but died of anxiety, glancing back at
the long empty corridor, where, despite the late night, a guard, a
servant, or a late guest could show up at every moment…</p>

<p>The stairs were seen at the very end. Thomas
ran up to them after the wonderer, trying to be silent the same,
but his iron feet made a terrible thunder that caused the whole
great bulk of a stone house to shake, the lamps to twinkle with
fear, the splendid portraits of noble ancestors to jump and drop
pieces of paint.</p>

<p>Thundering like an avalanche coming from the
peak of Himalayas, Thomas darted after the wonderer to the floor
below. They hid in a draped niche to let some dark figures pass by.
It was hot and stuffy there, fine dust filled their nostrils.
Thomas tried to hold his nose, but the gauntlet banged, very loud
in that deathly silence, on his lowered visor. Thomas froze, not
daring to move, heard the steps stop near him. His nose was itching
unbearably, and he sneezed with all his might, thinking of nothing
in the world but the excruciating itch. <emphasis>I just couldn’t help
it.</emphasis></p>

<p>In the faint light that penetrated through
the heavy curtain, he saw a flash of sword nearby, heard the
wonderer’s constrained breath. The steps on the other side came
close. “Ektius, did you hear it?” a soft voice said in
astonishment.</p>

<p>“I’m damned if I didn’t!” a different voice
replied. It seemed to belong to an older man. “I <emphasis>have</emphasis> told
you! And you, with your modern ideas… The other world does exist,
and our old house is haunted. Though only at night.”</p>

<p>“Who can that be? Do you have any ideas?”</p>

<p>“A great-grandfather of our master, judging
by his beastly bellow. And also a clank of iron, did you hear? He
was the curator of Southern moorings and ended his life in chains,
beheaded for misappropriation of the duties paid. Or maybe his
father who met the same end…”</p>

<p>Thomas slapped on his visor again, trying to
hold his nose. The wonderer’s fingers removed the iron plate
quickly, squeezed the bridge of his nose painfully. Surprised,
Thomas felt that the unbearable itch stopped abruptly. <emphasis>Like a
scream ceased by a sword blow.</emphasis></p>

<p>“They live own life there…” a thoughtful
voice said on the other side of the curtain. “I think… no, it seems
to me that ghosts are strolling about this empty house at night,
just like you and me, and one asks another, ‘Do you think we should
believe in those tales of live men?’”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his legs numb, his nose itching
desperately again. The bitter sweat gnawed at his eyes, tickled his
neck ruthlessly, ran down his back in hot acrid streams, his feet
bathed in the hot. Probably a strange puddle was forming around
him. <emphasis>And the two insomniac philosophical fools would discuss its
origin in a long and tedious way, based on the existence of the
other world and the features of ghostly life.</emphasis></p>

<p>“I think… no, it seems to me it’s definitely
not our master’s grandfather,” the voice said thoughtfully. “He was
hanged, I now remember that exactly! Hanged in accordance with his
noble origin: on a silk rope! And this one, I think… no, it seems
to me…”</p>

<p>Thomas was about to collapse: standing on one
foot is very difficult, especially when you are choking with dust
and gushing with sweat. He heard the wonderer sigh nearby, then
felt a light push on shoulder. Thomas took a deep breath and heard,
“I think… no, it seems to me…”</p>

<p>The knight tore the curtain off in a jerk,
saw two faces recoiling in fright. “<emphasis>What</emphasis> seems to you,
fool?” he yelled fiercely. “A bum? If you <emphasis>thought</emphasis> rather
than it seemed to you, you wouldn’t be such an ass!”</p>

<p>The wonderer stepped ahead. “Your Grace,” he
told Thomas loudly, “who knew your great-grandson would degenerate
into such an ass? I warned you to have less excesses…”</p>

<p>Thomas’s fist darted forward. The poor man
flew silently across the corridor and slipped down the opposite
wall. The wonderer waved his hand carelessly, the second
philosopher gasped and sprawled, like a frog, in the middle of the
corridor.</p>

<p>“Run!” Oleg whispered. They darted
downstairs, thundering like a herd of shoed horses. Thomas gasped,
gripped the walls in abrupt turns, his iron fingers left deep
scratches. Oleg rushed like a huge bear, jumped over stairs, came
running into the walls, wheeled round silently and dashed on.</p>

<p>It seemed to Thomas they had reached the
cellars when Oleg stopped abruptly. “The last flight of stairs
ahead,” he said softly. “But the entrance is closed… and guarded.
By two.”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped for air, his mouth wide open.
“We crush…” he said hoarsely. “Overrun!.. Only two?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head, looking sad and
accusing. “Innocent people? In their own house?”</p>

<p>Thomas wiped sweat off his face with his iron
palm, turned away, feeling a bit ashamed. He breathed heavily, shot
anxious glances around: at any moment, someone could come and see
them on that noticeable spot – in the middle of the stairs!</p>

<p>Oleg took a golden dinar out of a small
pocket in his belt, swung his arm broadly. Thomas could not see the
coin vanished in the dim light, but the far guards alerted, one
took his axe and walked briskly along the wall, bending like a
predator. He disappeared in the shade. For a long time, nothing
happened. Thomas got all fidgety when, finally, there came the
guard’s surprised voice. Another guard cried back, they exchanged
few words. The second guard checked the door bars quickly, glanced
out at the window to see whether some important guest was coming
upstairs from the street, and hurried to his comrade, his drawn
crossbow with him.</p>

<p>Oleg waited for the guard to disappear in the
corridor shade, then made a sign to Thomas. They darted quickly
across the hall, Oleg removed the hooks and bars in a flash. When
he flung the door open, there was an angry shout behind, a click of
steel bowstring. Thomas recoiled instinctively, a short crossbow
bolt went into the massive door near his head. He shook his fist,
leaped out into the night street after Oleg.</p>

<p>Oleg dragged the knight quickly along the
wall, hiding in the shade. They turned round the corner, and that
was when Thomas felt the cold air, the closeness of sea, saw the
stony space of broad, colossal streets ahead.</p>

<p>They heard a shout behind, a bang of door, a
clang of steel. Oleg took an idle pace, swaying slightly, his belly
thrust out. Thomas also tried to assume a carefree air of a reveler
coming back home, though his heart still beating like a sheep’s
tail and some smallest muscle under his knees shaking nastily.</p>

<p>“Now where?” Thomas asked. “Our inn…”</p>

<p>“…said its last cuckoo,” Oleg replied.
“Fortunately, we are no Saracen to travel with our harems. I’ve
taken all our things. Do you have the cup?”</p>

<p>Thomas grabbed his bag in fright. His fingers
felt the familiar prominence: it resembled a woman’s tight breast
or her lusty hip curve. The cup replied with a muffled tinkle.
Thomas hurried to take his iron fingers off it. “But Constantinople
is big!”</p>

<p>“I know plenty of decent inns and hotels,”
Oleg said comfortingly. He thought for a while, then shook his head
with regret. “Though decent ones do not fit… We’ll be exposed
there.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go to the port,” Thomas offered.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, isn’t Krizhina waiting for you?
And I’m too old for such things. We need something in the middle of
decency and comfort. Such places can also be found in the city,
strange as it may seem.”</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>Oleg sat in the tavern of the inn where he’d
stopped with Thomas. The knight almost never budged from their
room, a small and dirty one on the fifth floor. He would sharpen
the swords, both own and the wonderer’s, mend the hollows in his
armor. Oleg brought him food and beer up. Thomas was too noticeable
in his armor, and he refused to take it off. Meanwhile, Oleg, in
his barbarian jack of wolfskin, could easily pass for a
longshoreman, a sailor from a barbarian ship, or a smuggler, whom
the shores of Golden Bay were teemed with.</p>

<p>In order not to stand out at all, Oleg
hunched up, thrust out his belly to hide his mighty stature. He
never hid his face, but it was now angry, annoyed, with no hint of
reclusion and search of high Truth. He swilled beer slowly from a
huge mug, shot sulky glances at visitors. He could see himself in
their eyes: a shaggy, embittered man, eager to make a scuffle
whenever an opportunity presents itself.</p>

<p>He saw dicers in three tables away, felt
which side was made heavier. He could win a lot of money before
they knifed him. He spotted men who went into the secret door to
see the innkeeper: all bronzed, smelling of sea wind, strong in
shoulders, sweeping in moves. Each of them wore a strange wide hat,
which was tied under his chin with a broad stripe, and a predatory
curved Saracen knife in a leather scabbard on his belt.
<emphasis>Contraband goods, poisons, maps and precise information of the
numbers and positions of imperial hosts, the plans of invasions,
big and small conspiracies, robberies – all of it flows into the
secret door guarded by those two men who look like arrant drunkards
with mugs of beer.</emphasis></p>

<p>It was the third day Oleg spent in the
tavern. He would drink much, due to the heat, have a game of dice
in times. For dinner, he always ordered some roast meat with
greens: a common food of Slavic shepherds, one of whom he pretended
to be. As he came upstairs with food for Thomas, he found the
knight nervous and angry. <emphasis>The time flies by, the beautiful
Krizhina wrings her hands in the castle on the bank of Don, and the
wonderer is drinking like a sponge, goggling at the daubed whores
who cluster round every sailor or smuggler.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg already knew all the innkeeper’s spies.
He could follow their ways in the narrow city nooks in his mind,
could earn a fortune by disclosing the secret contraband stores to
the basileus or naming the key figures of the secret net that had
spread over the left wing of the Emperor’s palace. However, he’d
seen not a single spy of the Seven yet: he would have known them
once they appeared on the threshold.</p>

<p>Only in the evening of the third day, did he
see a man whose resemblance to a smuggler was too close to be true.
Oleg’s heart got fluttering. He leaned his head to the jug of wine,
watching closely, out of a corner of his eye, the face, gait, moves
of that man. <emphasis>No urgent need to hear him speaking. Mimics can
give out the lock, stock, and barrel of such secret thoughts that
one does not suspect himself of.</emphasis></p>

<p>The “smuggler” sat at a table nearby. While
Oleg watched him asquint, over the mug of beer, the door flew open
and two more men came in. Oleg almost choked. <emphasis>First no one, then
three agents of the Seven at once!</emphasis> All strong and muscular,
with cold eyes and exact moves that were adjusted in the exhausting
exercise with arms and hand-to-hand combats. The three were not too
young but in the most dangerous age: mature, experienced,
skillful.</p>

<p>He stooped over the mug to hide the glitter
in his eyes. <emphasis>I have to warn Thomas.</emphasis> The knight had got
Oleg’s leave to go out. In those minutes, he must be pacing up and
down in front of the tavern, cloaked and hooded tightly: not in his
cloak with red cross, but in a grey one of a common man. However,
it was Thomas who could drive the attention of spies: still in his
armor, huge knightly spurs dinging at his every step… <emphasis>And no way
to rise from the table at once: spies are on the special look-out
at first moments, they’ll spot me.</emphasis></p>

<p>The last of the three took in the hall at a
careful glance, walked along the narrow passage among tables,
watching and listening. Suddenly he turned and stopped in front of
the table where a lone sulky barbarian of sturdy built, clad in a
rough wolfskin, was swelling his beer. The spy made no move to sit
down, but set both fists against the table top and peered at
Oleg.</p>

<p>Feeling his heart thumping violently, as it
forced up hot blood for a brief fierce fighting, Oleg turned his
head slowly. “Why are you staring, red ape?” he bellowed angrily.
“No alms on weekdays, and don’t beg me for them on holidays… Get
out! Don’t stand in my light!”</p>

<p>“Hey, friend,” the agent said comfortingly,
“calm down, down…”</p>

<p>“Friend?” Oleg flared up. “Who said I can
have a red ape as my friend? An ape with such equine… I mean, such
a pig snout! Though I’m no Sar… Sara… Saracen, I hate pigs! Save
the ones roast, in the middle of the table, with horseradish…”</p>

<p>He lapsed into drunken mumbling, dropped his
head on the table but jerked it up at once, stared at the agent
before him with a dim eye, as though trying to recall where the man
had come from. The agent did not wince. “Calm down,” he said
kindly. “If I have offended you, please forgive me. I owe you a
drink. Hey, wench, a mug of good wine!”</p>

<p>Oleg gave a drunken smile, waved his dirty
finger before the agent’s nose. “Who told you I… I can’t pay for my
own drink? Do you think yourself the only who can get things past
harbor rats?”</p>

<p>The woman put before Oleg a big glass of red
wine: a cut-glass one, set in thick copper. Oleg sniffed secretly
and smelled, apart from the fermented grape juice, a strange
sweetly-disgusting fragrance. <emphasis>As beautiful and dangerous as a
young viper.</emphasis> The wine had poison in it… a poison or another
nasty thing to make a man go out of his wits, blab out everything
he concealed before, and then turn up his toes all the same.</p>

<p>Oleg held his breath, strained to make his
face filled with blood and his ears crimson. Having put that
furious look on, he stood up, a scary shaggy barbarian, started to
raise his voice, working himself up, breaking into a shout. “What’s
about me… that seems I can’t buy wine myself? I can buy the whole
of this hovel if I like! I can buy <emphasis>you</emphasis> – outbid and purchase
with your lock, stock, and barrel, your piles and bald patch! You
paid your last coin for your pants, fastened your belt at the last
hole! Such a worm to treat me? Me, a Viking from <emphasis>Big
Serpent</emphasis>?”</p>

<p>The agent gave him an unfriendly once-over,
but controlled himself, not allowing the squabble and scuffle with
a drunken barbarian who only lacks a good brawl, his mug smashed
and his snot bloody to finish his carouse normally and have a good
night sleep. Oleg felt the agent suspecting him… but only
suspecting. <emphasis>I need to keep up a part.</emphasis> If he had to fight, he
would fight as a Viking from <emphasis>Big Serpent</emphasis>, not a peaceful
hermit who, however, was not born a hermit.</p>

<p>The agent replied with a patient malice,
though the bad blood started to fill him too. “I don’t usually
invite every sot to drink with me! And if I do, he should accept!
You <emphasis>shall</emphasis> drink it, fool! If you scream, we’ll maim you at
first, and then you’ll drink it all the same, even if you gulp down
your teeth with this wine!”</p>

<p>Out of the corner of his eye, Oleg spotted
the two men coming from both sides. He made blood rush back from
his face. <emphasis>Let them see me go pale and sober with fear.</emphasis> He
reached for the glass, his arm shaking, gave a begging look to the
agent who grinned in triumph, his suspicion gone. The barbarian was
only fierce in words, as all men of his sort are, while heated up
with wine and swears, but to stand up bravely, face to face…</p>

<p>Oleg’s fingers clenched on the glass, his
shaking hand started to raise it. When the glass was on a level
with his breast, he flung it at the agent’s face. The spy recoiled,
a long curved dagger was in his hand at once, but his eyes poured
over with caustic wine, then a mighty blow sent him flying over the
table into the depth of the tavern. Oleg elbowed the second one on
his belly, without looking there, stooped, as he expected a back
header of the third one, lifted a heavy oak bench and brandished it
overhead.</p>

<p>He heard two dry thumps, saw the hilts of
throwing knives that appeared in the thick seat before it came down
on the third agent with a thunder, smashing him, broking his bones.
Oleg, still in the part of a drunken Viking, swung the bench,
roared, swore in Sveyan and cursed in Norman, but in that mad
whirlwind, his eyes caught a glimpse of those few faces that
differed in looks or expressions.</p>

<p>Suddenly he was surrounded. Fighting, he put
his mask aside, as he saw an elder man in simple clothing who rose
from a far table and, in no apparent hurry, walked out. Oleg struck
with his feet, elbows, and head. <emphasis>All’s fair that leads to
survival.</emphasis> One could learn much of the foul business of maiming
and killing if he did not shy away from dirty tricks of Egyptians,
Hittites, Arians, Scythes. <emphasis>Up to the present-day warrior
monks.</emphasis></p>

<p>There were seven or eight crawling, moaning
bodies on the floor when the door thundered open and Thomas burst
in. With a momentary flash of sword in hand, he jumped ahead, cut,
for some reason, the oak bench apart at one strike. “You did them
alone again?” he screamed indignantly. “Is it fair?”</p>

<p>“They are not worthy of a knight’s sword,”
Oleg explained hastily. “All common men, that’s strange!” He ran
past Thomas, darted out into the night street. The enormous city
was dark, with only crimson fires blazing on the towers and orange
lamps lit in the upper windows of rich mansions.</p>

<p>A hunched figure slipped along a dark wall.
Oleg alerted but kept smelling the musty city air, listening to
rustle, far shouts. In back alleys and streets, he saw quite
whores. They felt, with their sharp senses of small predators
accustomed to danger, the bloody brawl behind the thick tavern
door. “That way,” he pointed at last. “He ran there!”</p>

<p>Thomas kept his curses to himself, sheathed
his sword and rushed after the wonderer. Oleg dashed along the
wall, as silent as a giant bat, his arms cut the air noiselessly.
His feet made neither a crunch nor a click, while Thomas’s steps
rumbled and thundered as if he’d galloped into a china shop on his
warhorse. “Sir wonderer, whom are we after?”</p>

<p>“A thief. He’s after the cup.”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his bag, which he never left now,
in fright. He fell back. When he managed, with great effort, to
come up with Oleg again, his eyes had almost popped out, his heart
pounded violently.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, go back to the inn!” the
wonderer cried out on the run, without looking back. “I swear I
will only track one odd man and be back at once! We will storm the
enemy’s fortress together, I swear it on the beard of Rod! Or on
the innocence of Holy Virgin, as you like…” Having said that, he
speeded up. In the narrow dark alleys, Thomas lost the sight of his
back at once.</p>

<p>The knight spat, feeling his saliva tight and
thickened, and stopped. His heart quivered like a small bird in the
throat, eager to fly out. Sweat showered down his body, a sound of
surf in his ears. He rocked from side to side: it had been ages
since he ran in his full armor the last time. He grasped that the
wonderer had made a scuffle to scare the unknown agent away and
pursue him then. He, Thomas Malton of Gisland, would have done the
same: a sophisticated stratagem. But what fortress did he speak of?
Were they to storm the castle of basileus, as the Emperor of Romays
is named? But why would they need the Emperor?</p>

<p>With no ideas at all, Thomas went plodding
back.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 24</p>

<p>When Thomas came up into their room in the
inn, the wonderer was lying on his bed, hands behind head. On the
floor, there was a big plate of fruit, a jug of wine. Judging by
apple tails, the wonderer had gorged apples with their cores.</p>

<p>Oleg livened up at once. “Greetings, Sir
Thomas!” he said cheerfully, waved his hand and even his right
foot: probably it was a sign of ardent love and passion. “I see you
visited all the taverns on the way… plenty of them, I recall. What
the hell, where’s my youth? You must have missed no whore, a whole
quarter of them here. Fine swarthy Asian wenches, plump Jewish
women, cold girls of North… You did a right thing. There’s only
dust and mud of roads ahead.”</p>

<p>“Curse that tongue of yours, sir wonderer,”
Thomas said. He flopped heavily on the bench, his face exhausted,
the red pressed-in stripe on his forehead filled with mud, big
beads of sweat running down his face. “All the night long, I tried
to get out of the back streets where you left me. Whenever I went,
it was either a dead end… or a return to the same place!”</p>

<p>“How’s that possible?” Oleg gasped. “The
inn’s but a step from!”</p>

<p>“I saw it then,” Thomas explained in
vexation. “When I got to a familiar street. Precisely, when I came
to the inn’s gate… and even then I almost passed by! Do you have
anything more substantial than this food for goats?”</p>

<p>“I’ll send for meat,” Oleg replied hastily.
“Don’t take your armor off. It suits you, I see now. You are so
magnificent in it, so noble! I tracked the place of the chief
malefactor. We need to take him quickly, before he thinks up a new
foul trick to play!”</p>

<p>As Thomas ate the meat the servant brought
them, he glowered at the wonderer. He knew the saying about the
donkey who was not relieved of his load, as that was said to be
decorating him. He felt dead tired, like never before, and wished
greatly to undo his clasps and get out of the heavy steel armor.
“One of the Seven?” he asked.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped, as though thrown up, came to the
window. Thomas saw his back strained. “Yes,” the wonderer replied
in a dull voice, without turning to him. “I hope he’s alone. And
I’m afraid he is!”</p>

<p>Thomas choked, started to chew the hot meat
slower, with more care. Strength returned to his tired body, flowed
in with every slice he swallowed, but his fear of the unfathomable
powers of magic was back too. <emphasis>Despite his strength and courage,
the wonderer is no man of war. He fails to understand that’s
impossible to break into a well-guarded house with less than a
hundred well-armed soldiers. Who will allow such an attack within
the capital city? To take a castle, we need a thousand men. And if
the master is an adept of magic, one of the Seven Secret Lords, no
host will do for him!</emphasis> “Will we break through the gate?” Thomas
asked, doing his best to conceal fear.</p>

<p>The wonderer paced up and down their small
room, like a predatory animal in a cage, clenched his fists, rubbed
the temples of his head. “The gate is always closed…”</p>

<p>“We’ll break it!”</p>

<p>“Is it a jest? While we break the gate, the
Secret One will sit by the window, drinking tea and pointing at
us.”</p>

<p>“I think what he drinks is no tea,” Thomas
replied with his mouth full, chewed it well and added, “Surely, a
direct assault is impossible. What if we enter as traders? I don’t
think he goes shopping. Rather the goods are brought to his
place.”</p>

<p>“I doubt whether traders are allowed into the
house itself.”</p>

<p>“What we need is to pass the gate!”</p>

<p>“Sure? The entrance door of the house can be
even stronger. I know such cases.” Thomas raised his eyebrows in
surprise, and Oleg waved away in vexation. “Sir knight, one can be
born a seignior but not a hermit! In my young years, I’d climbed on
towers, like a nasty monkey, jumped from masts… A good way from
above! Pity it won’t work… We have to come by sea!”</p>

<p>“Is the house at the shore?”</p>

<p>“It’s rather a tower,” Oleg explained.
“Though there’s a house too. However, if I got the signs right, we
shall find our foe in the tower. It’s a more convenient place for
observation.”</p>

<p>“Of us?”</p>

<p>Oleg winced. “Of stars, ebbs and flows of a
tide, the phases of moon, the flocks of birds… In a word, we must
try the way by sea.”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his hands cold. He moved an
unfinished slice of meat away, sighed convulsively, and objected.
“In a boat? We’ll be set with arrows before we row up to. It’s no
forest: neither bushes nor logs to hide behind. A crossbow bolt can
even break my steel armor! And moorings are tall here, for guards
to hide and endure an assault from sea easily.”</p>

<p>Oleg ran about the room for a while, then
hurled himself on the bed. The thick boards gave a plaintive creak.
He turned onto his back, his broad palms darted behind his head.
His eyes screwed up angrily at the whitewashed ceiling. “I see no
other way! Neither do my charms. If we boat up as fishermen, we
shan’t be met by a whole host. The mooring is only guarded by two
men. Though they are protected by its tall stone board… And two
guards at the entrance to the tower! Only the four of them can see
us!”</p>

<p>“Who’s inside the tower?” Thomas asked.</p>

<p>Oleg waved away in annoyance. “A party of
hired soldiers, but we have to think of getting out of the boat
alive first! The guards won’t like it, will they?”</p>

<p>Thomas suspected him of nervous irony. He
scowled and replied gloomily, “We need to act very quickly. And
accurately. But the main thing is that we’ll have to hit without a
warning! That’s prohibited by the knightly code of honor.”</p>

<p>“They’ll sock us without a warning
themselves! Once they see we are no fishermen.”</p>

<p>“They are one thing,” Thomas snapped
stubbornly, “and we are another! We should not behave like
them.”</p>

<p>Oleg twisted his mouth in a smirk but said
nothing, sparing the knight. <emphasis>Being uncompromising is good for
songs, but it’s no way to survive in real life. The one who lived
at least thirty years, as this valiant knight did, should not tell
tales of his nonconformity: no fools here, only married men, as the
Saracen say.</emphasis></p>

<p>He put things into his bag methodically,
looking over the walls and corners as though he knew he would never
come there again. Thomas sighed, cursing the day and hour when he
resolved to deliver the Holy Grail to his native Britain. <emphasis>She
blooms like a garden without this miraculous cup as well</emphasis>. He
tightened his belt, checked the sword in scabbard, lowered and
raised his visor, changing from an armored man to a solid metal
statue.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>The guards had got used long ago to the
fisher boats crawling lazily within the Golden Bay. Some boats
stayed on the spot for days and nights, others moved continually,
sailing or rowing, as though following the fish. The guards had
only to drive the boats away from the stone wall of the mooring,
but hardly any of them approached it: there were bare rocks
sticking out of water. <emphasis>Fish has no love for such places.</emphasis>
Only two weeks before they had an occasion to use their weapons: a
fool fell asleep in his boat, the rising tide brought it close to
the mooring, where the drunkard was woken up by a strong blow with
the thick end of a spear on his light head.</p>

<p>In one of the boats, they saw a fisherman
naked to his waist, his strong bronzed shoulders gleaming in the
sun. His fellow was steaming in his wide cloak, even the hood
pulled low over his muzzle. <emphasis>That one must have been sunburnt, a
foreign fool, his skin under the cloak red like a boiled lobster.
Now he hates the daylight, and tomorrow he will get blisters all
over. For the next week, his skin will be peeling off, at his moans
and groans, in big shreds, like a snake’s one.</emphasis></p>

<p>The guards sat in the shade, their backs
leaned against the warm wall of the tower. One of them had a paunch
bottle in a wicker basket at his knees. The sea waves lapped in two
steps below, but brought very little coolness, while the sun-warmed
tower emitted heat. The guards glanced wistfully at the clear blue
sky: only a puny white cloud on the far edge of it, and even that
one melting before their eyes, like butter on a hot pan.</p>

<p>In the fisher boat, decrepit and dirty, the
half-naked fisherman left the rows, yawned broadly, showing his
jaws to gods, scratched his sweaty breast. His fire-read hair was
matted, he felt hot and filthy, shot malicious glances at his pal
who sat drowsy, his hood pulled over his eyes. The light breeze and
surf were driving the boat to the coast, but it was still far from
the tower, so the guards only watched it, with sneers and
condescension. <emphasis>Poor things they who spend their life catching
fish, selling it in the market to get small coin, enough to buy
bread and cheese… Thank Christ, we are no fishermen but skilled
guards!</emphasis></p>

<p>The fisherman reached for his cloaked mate,
pushed him roughly. The other man gave a start, looked with
surprise. The first fisherman roared, pointed angrily at the net
dragged behind the boat. The second one adjusted his cloak, his
shoulders shivered. The guard who had opened his mouth to cry the
fishermen away couldn’t help a malicious grin. He winked to his
partner who burst with laughter, as he recalled himself having got
sunburnt some time ago and shivering in the torrid heat like in
winter: a familiar thing!</p>

<p>The half-naked fisherman bellowed fiercely,
his eyes goggled, as he pointed at the net. The cloaked one
shivered, wrapped himself up, snapped back gloomily. The half-naked
man almost broke into shriek, spitting, and the guards felt
compassion for him. <emphasis>Why should one drag his boat along the
strait if his net is full of fish? It’s not his fault that his
stupid companion has such a piglet’s skin that gets sunburnt
instead of swarthy.</emphasis></p>

<p>The fishermen argued. The first one left his
oars, shaking his fists angrily. The second one thrust him away,
the half-naked man lost his feet in the rocking boat and fell on
his back, his feet up in a funny way. The cloaked one stayed on the
aft. When the half-naked man jumped up, swearing and shaking fists,
the other one also stood up and turned out to be his height, though
the half-naked fishermen looked, to the professional eyes of the
guards, neither small nor weak.</p>

<p>They grappled near the aft. The half-naked
man landed a blow that made his pal bend in waist. He all but flew
over the board, but gripped the half-naked one by arm at the last
moment. For a while, they tried to break each other. The guards saw
muscles bulging on the half-naked man’s broad back, then the
cloaked fisherman pushed his rival away again, stepped ahead. They
stood face to face in the middle of the boat, devouring each other
with eyes, cursing, and blaming for their coming back without fish.
Almost at the same time, both of them leaned back, their fists
darted forwards. An embittered brawl began. The guards heard
muffled thumps.</p>

<p><emphasis>A fight of two strong, beastly man is
always pleasant to watch: it’s exciting, like a sip of heady
wine.</emphasis> The two men in the boat ran wild quickly: the reckless
sun would make anyone mad and eager to wreak out his anger on
anyone. They neither yelled nor swore anymore but hurled their
fists forward, trying to land a painful blow, to crush and destroy.
The half-naked man got blooded, the guards hung over the board in
excitement, oblivious of their bodies being in the bitter sun, out
of salutary coolness. One guard bet two against one that the
half-naked fisherman, though blooded, would overcome his cloaked
mate: he had the muscle of a champion wrestler. Probably he had
been a wrestler in circus until he got fired for bargaining with
public.</p>

<p>The second guard hesitated. <emphasis>The half-naked
one looks stronger, his muscle exposed, he fights like mad beast,
but his rival seems to land more accurate blows. And under his
cloak, he can have a knife, at least the one for cutting fish… And
in that brain-melting sun, one would stab a knife uncaringly, only
to see the blood of the other, hear him squealing, then
rattling…</emphasis></p>

<p>The boat was coming sidewise to the stone
mooring, waves splashed against its boards. The boat rocked and
swung, driven by the wind and water, raised by the tide that had
covered the prominent bare stones, so the boat passed over them
easily, with probably only a light scratch of its bottom on
them.</p>

<p>The guards neighed like horses. The cloaked
fisherman had blood gushing from his smashed brow: he often swept
it off with hand, spreading it over his face, swore hoarsely. The
half-naked man jumped on him, and both collapsed into the boat.
Fortunately, they fell on the wooden bench that cracked apart. The
fishermen rolled, grappling like two furious bears, into the other
bench, and it went into splinters too.</p>

<p>One of the oars had floated away long ago,
the other jolted blade-up in the water. When the half-naked man
thrust his pal, the latter’s head crushed out the piece of wood
with oarlock, and the second oar also went floating in the
waves.</p>

<p>The boat was driven almost close to the wall
rising from the water. If even the guards commanded to get away,
the fishermen would not be able to do it without oars. They could
swim after them, but the oarlocks were kicked out, as though by a
hammer – what lusty fellows those fishermen were! – and the boat
itself looked ready to go into splinters at any moment.</p>

<p>One of the guards sighed and pulled the rope
forcefully: nobody was allowed to moor there. If the guards failed
to drive them away, they were obliged to call for reinforcement.
The massive door of the tower opened with a creak. A head in a
gleaming helmet look out. As the guard saw the boat, the head
vanished. At the next moment, he leapt out with sword and shield.
After him, the next one came out, all clad in iron. He kicked the
door shut behind him, leaned his back against it and fell drowsy at
once, his head dropped and face twisted.</p>

<p>The new guards joined, with fascination, into
watching the fight. Both bet their weekly salary on the fighters,
but one, however, reached his crossbow without looking, set it
against the ground, started to turn the winch slowly, drawing the
steel bowstring. The metal pieces of the crossbow were red-hot, as
well as the string, so the guard several times left the winch with
a sigh, his eyes fixed on the fishermen.</p>

<p>The boat side crashed against the stone wall.
The tide dragged the boat along it. Guards stretched their necks,
bent over the border, one of them almost fell out, as the stone
wall was rising over the water for a man’s height, even at full
flow. They heard terrible rattles from the boat: the cloaked man
pressed the half-naked one against the bottom, strangling him, the
cloak almost covered both of them. The guards bellowed, clapped
their rough hands on the stone border. Everyone was cheering up the
fisherman he’d bet on.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the cloaked man got up and made a
long creepy jump from the boat straight onto the stone wall. He
pushed off the boat so mightily that it flew almost to the middle
of the Golden Bay. The half-naked fisherman was also up at once, a
bow in hands, a flash of iron arrowhead on.</p>

<p>Startled, guards had no time to draw swords
before the fishermen clutched at the stone edge, pulled himself up,
jumped down on their side at once. The first guard leapt forward
silently, slashed with his sword. The fisherman jerked his head
aside, annoyed. Surprisingly, the blade did not slice in, only
grinded, as though against metal, and was almost twisted out from
the dumbfounded guard’s hand. However, the sword cut the cord of
the cloak, which fell down, and the guard almost dropped his weapon
in astonishment.</p>

<p><emphasis>A furious crusader knight in full
armor!</emphasis> The guard had time to see eyes, as blue as the cloudless
sky, through the visor before he had to back under a hail of
terrible blows: the knight drew his huge sword in a flash. The
guard felt his death close: against the knight’s two-handed weapon,
his sword looked a puny twig.</p>

<p>Thomas slashed with all his might, attacked.
The guard missed a terrible blow and fell, with bleeding head, over
the border into the close waves.</p>

<p>Thomas turned quickly to the sea. The empty
boat floated lonely on the waves, being filled with water through
the cracks. Thomas’s heart froze with fear, but then he heard a
splash, big hands emerged over the border, and the wonderer, soaked
like a water god, jumped over it with a shout. “Why are you
standing, fool? Run into the tower! One escaped!”</p>

<p>Thomas rushed, as though spurred, to the wide
open door of the tower. On his run, he almost fell, stumbling over
the crossbowman’s body with a long arrow in throat. In the
doorstep, he slipped in a puddle of blood gushing out of the body
of a big guard (almost twice as broad as he was tall) and hurried
up, jumping over three stairs at once, then over two.</p>

<p>He heard a fast tapping of boots behind. The
wonderer came up with him and rushed by, like a sea whirlwind,
splashing water around, his wet shoulder brushed against Thomas.
The knight looked with envy at his broad bare back, trickles of
blood still running down it: left by the fresh liver they’d bought
at the market and used for staining each other while they
fought.</p>

<p>The wonderer vanished ahead. Thomas hurried
upstairs, muttering curses. jumping over just one stair at once. He
spotted fresh drops of blood. The wonderer’s arrow had injured that
guard, the fourth and last one. Oleg had to come upon him before he
could climb upstairs to warn his master.</p>

<p>The thought of the master, the dreadful
Secret One, made Thomas feel creepy inside, his legs gave way. He
tried running up over two stairs at once again, but got exhausted
short after, because of the steel armor he had on, and dragged
himself along from one stair to another, a sword in hand, another
hand clinging to the rail.</p>

<p>Above, on the fifth floor, there was a short
noise that died away at once. When Thomas dragged himself to the
spot, wide streams of blood were running to meet him, two guards
lay across the stairs. Thomas stepped over them and plodded on.
There was a clang above again, a muffled shout. Thomas tried to run
upstairs, as the wonderer had managed to, but sweat poured over his
eyes, sledge-hammers seemed to be pounding in head. He felts swung
from the wall to the rail, his feet far behind, he dragged them
like some cast-iron pillars.</p>

<p>He barely had time to hug the rail when a man
in armor came rolling downstairs, head over heels, followed by
another one, rolling in the same way, clad in fine Saracen mail.
Thomas raised his sword, but lowered it at once and half rushed,
half plodded on. He heard some shouts, clang, and ringing above
again. <emphasis>Much higher.</emphasis></p>

<p>All but crying with impotent malice, he
dragged himself up the damned stairs that seemed to be endless.
Twice he splashed through blood puddles, steeped over guards who
moaned and scratched walls and stairs.</p>

<p>When Thomas climbed on the very top, clinging
to his knightly pride rather than the rail and the wall, he saw the
world waving, as if he was sailing a Viking ship. He heard the
rumble and pounding of blood vessels bursting in ears. Coarse black
snow was falling before his eyes.</p>

<p>The stairs ended at a wide open door. In the
depth of the big room with strange furniture, the wonderer stood
with bare sword. In three or four steps from him, a frail man, in a
long robe and a knitted cap, sat in a deep soft armchair. He was
unarmed and cornered between two blind walls.</p>

<p>Thomas sobbed in utter exhaustion, slipped
down the doorpost onto the floor. The wonderer wheeled round
abruptly, his eyes opened wide. “Sir Thomas, are you wounded?” he
inquired with anxiety.</p>

<p>Thomas made a sluggish gesture to show he was
all right, Oleg could set to the black mage, not to let him out of
sight, as he, Thomas Malton of Gisland, a noble knight, disliked
them who sold their souls to devil and had nothing to do with them,
that rather befitted a Pagan…</p>

<p>“Who are you?” Oleg demanded harshly from the
man in armchair. “What is your name?”</p>

<p>The man stretched his thin bloodless lips in
a wary smirk, spoke slowly. “You seem to know who I am. Who are
<emphasis>you,</emphasis> that is the question. You look like a savage barbarian.
Maybe a chieftain of those? A new star on the northern heavens? The
one who will shake the universe, like Attila? Do you know who
Attila was?”</p>

<p>“I do,” Oleg replied briefly.</p>

<p>The man in armchair watched him through
narrowed eyes. Oleg felt the way his mighty brain worked in:
analyzing, calculating options with lightning speed, tenacious,
missing not a slightest nuance, quick to reject wrong solutions.
“You are no barbarian,” the man in armchair said suddenly. “It is
only a mask! But you could become not only a supreme chieftain of
barbarians but also a rich man here, in Constantinople…” Suddenly
his eyes widened. He tried to stand up but fell back into his
armchair at once. His eyes goggled, as he gave out an astonished
whisper. “Impossible!.. You… you are Oleg the Wise?”</p>

<p>“I am,” Oleg replied in a flat, lifeless
voice. “You see I was the first to know you, Baruk.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m Baruk,” the man in armchair
whispered. The knitted cap on his head went shaking: he laughed.
“Sorry… it’s nervous. Now I see why all the attempts to take the
cup, all those… ha ha!.. absolutely reliable ones failed… We were
informed the cup was borne by some brass-headed fool, with a beggar
pilgrim plodding at his side!”</p>

<p>Through the noise and rumble in ears, Thomas
could barely hear half of it and understand hardly a thing, but,
sitting on the floor, he snapped out hoarsely, “Sir wonderer is no
beggar!”</p>

<p>Baruk shot a derisive, disdainful glance at
the knight, gave out a short laughter. “Sir wonderer?.. I see your
sense of humor, so unnecessary for the new world… What a blunder
our agents made! They <emphasis>showed their hair</emphasis>, as you Ruses put
it… Yes, we had to learn much about Rus’. The Secret Seven are
mostly busy with it now!”</p>

<p>Oleg seized the scabbard without looking,
drew the huge sword in with a thud. Baruk grew more confident, and
Thomas alerted, started to pull his cast-iron legs closer, breathed
deeply, in a haste to tame the blood pounding in ears.</p>

<p>Baruk leaned back deeper in his armchair, his
sharp eyes flashed with predatory sparkles. “You do not look a
giant… An intellectual giant, I mean. This kind of power can be
felt in each of the Seven, in many grand masters and even masters.
And you degraded… Wise? To make accurate forecasts, you need to
perfect your mind and will rather than to gad along roads, playing
a barbarian, a mercenary, or a merchant… I heard you once were the
strongest one. Weren’t you? Well, a feeble will turns strong if
trained, a weak mind gets working as well as a dozen of strong
ones, but strong brains fade if not used… I never had any doubts
about out way, but now I see how right we are!”</p>

<p>“You never had any doubts? Then you are
hopeless.”</p>

<p>“A play on words?”</p>

<p>“Why do you need the cup?” Oleg asked
gloomily.</p>

<p>Baruk said nothing. He grinned, as he looked
at the matted-haired barbarian standing before him. The magician
leaned back in his armchair haughtily, his eyes became cruel.
Thomas clenched his teeth, started to get up, clinging at the
doorpost. He felt a gross insult for his friend who had to stand
before the black magician, a devil’s servant, and be looked at as a
common man, a puny tramp, even called a beggar!</p>

<p>“Why?” Oleg asked again.</p>

<p>“A decision of the Counsel,” Baruk replied.
His eyes laughed.</p>

<p>“No one’s personal idea,” Oleg said
thoughtfully. “It makes a difference…”</p>

<p>“It does,” Baruk agreed jeeringly. “I heard
of what you did to Fagim, a former head of Secret Seven… But will
you stand up against the power of all Seven?”</p>

<p>Oleg was silent for a while, his face
darkened. “What’s special about that cup?” he asked in a dull voice
of a worn-out man.</p>

<p>Baruk shrugged, his eyes glittered defiantly.
“The blood of Christ. Didn’t you know it?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head, his eyes kept on Baruk’s
face. “It’s important for my knightly companion, but not for the
Counsel. The Secret Seven knew lots of prophets! They have the rod
of Zarathustra, the belt of Moses, the cloak of Buddha, the hammer
of Tor, the sandals of Mahomet, the club of Heracles, the spear of
Gilgamesh… and many other things of heroes, prophets, and sages
stored in their secret cache. You value them as a collection, some
curiosities. You are practical people, free of any superstition. I
don’t believe you could apply so many efforts only to add a new
item to that collection. I wonder how the cup could survive, in
spite of you driving every emotional thing away…”</p>

<p>“Why?” Baruk asked innocently.</p>

<p>Oleg answered, as he felt something concealed
behind that simple question. <emphasis>Shaping own thoughts into words can
help a solution or an eyeopener to present itself. It may seem
accidental, but in fact it’s the help from the inmost soul.</emphasis>
“Your god is Progress, Civilization,” Oleg said in an even,
measured voice. “And civilization has no need of such things.
Moreover, they are harmful or even dangerous to it. They only make
difference for culture…”</p>

<p>Baruk’s eyes narrowed. “You’ve answered your
own question,” he told Oleg through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>“So… only to keep the cup away from me?”</p>

<p>“From any culture bearer. This brass-headed
fool is one of them, as well as you, though he thinks of himself as
a civilizer. He’s hundred times purer than you, that’s all the
difference. He has an innocent baby’s soul.”</p>

<p>Oleg looked fixedly at him, his voice became
thoughtful. “You did not say what true value the cup has… For us!
However, that’s out of your power if that was a decision of the
Counsel, not your own. Hey, Baruk, you made several attempts to
kill us. Would you deny it? And I have a perfect moral right to pay
you back with your own coin. You see? So, if now you swear you
shall never disturb us again, we leave at once, and you can resume
your observations of stars. As you are the greatest expert at
heavens!”</p>

<p>The pounding in Thomas’s head ceased, but
pain came instead, as if red-hot pig iron was tucked into his
skull. The brain was boiling, filling its bone armor to the brim.
Thomas got up with effort, leaned against the wall, his feet still
shaking, a stitch in his side at every breath. Thomas regretted he
could not stop breathing and remain alive.</p>

<p>“What if I shan’t?” Baruk asked. His voice
remained derisive and gave no quaver. Thomas felt a chilly blow of
fear.</p>

<p>“I’ll kill you.” Oleg sounded like a sudden
blow of northern wind in that strange room piled up with thick
manuscripts with Cabbalist signs on their covers.</p>

<p>Baruk did not stir. He watched Oleg with
contempt, even with disgustful pity. “You won’t… You could do it to
protect yourself… but a man sitting in peace, like me? A cripple
confined to his armchair? No outlaw but the world’s best expert on
stars, a researcher of the secrets of universe?”</p>

<p>“But <emphasis>you</emphasis> can kill a man sitting in his
chair, can’t you?” Oleg asked in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>“I serve civilization! Progress. While you
serve mere culture. We have different laws.”</p>

<p>Incensed, Oleg gripped the hilt, pulled the
sword out slowly. He heard the ominous scraping of metal: it was
like a barely audible whistle. Baruk pressed himself into the back
of the armchair. He went pale, his eyes flickered with fear, but
his lips managed a smile. “Oh, stop it… A play of fury. You failed
to take into account that we had a long talk, so I had time to
calculate and measure you. Neither you nor this brass-headed friend
of yours can kill me. Just because I’m defenseless. You are
hampered by your culture, and he – by his knightly
prrrinciples!”</p>

<p>“Are you laughing at us?”</p>

<p>“I can’t help it! <emphasis>You</emphasis> were the ones to
disarm yourself. What you are proud of is a root of your failure. I
calculated both of you for a day and night ahead. I know the Brass
Head has his left heel sore. In three minutes, that dump one will
slip and elbow a cup off the table… And you in two minutes will
scratch your nose and look at the ceiling… Can <emphasis>you</emphasis> forecast
that accurate?”</p>

<p>“I’d love to. But I can’t,” Oleg
admitted.</p>

<p>“You are all in vague visions and prophecies,
while we have exact knowledge! Hey, wasn’t it what <emphasis>you</emphasis>
strove for? The past is concealed from us, new members of the
Counsel, but there are rumors that in the great antiquity you were
the one to rise against the dominance of mages and magic, to uphold
the knowing, knowery… I mean the research method, which now tends
to be called simply science… Was it that way?”</p>

<p>Thomas heard everything, but understood very
little of it: his head was buzzing. To avoid being an obedient fool
in the damned mage’s hands, he made two steps along the wall, away
from the table with a high crystal cup. Oleg glanced back at the
metal sound of his feet, scratched his nose thoughtfully. There was
a faint tapping above. Oleg looked up quickly. “Is anyone
there?”</p>

<p>“They won’t come in,” Baruk dismissed.
“Students.”</p>

<p>Hastily, Thomas backed one more step,
dumbfounded at the wonderer’s having scratched his nose and looked
up exactly as the warlock had foretold. Thomas felt a stitch in his
left heel, staggered on his numb legs, stumbled over his own sword
(it was lying on the floor since the exhausted knight had climbed
into the room) and crashed down. Furious, he got up, heard a
malicious laughter, gripped the sword hilt menacingly and turned
round with a haughty look.</p>

<p>A big red apple rolled up to his feet. Thomas
turned his head to the table. It lay on side, two manuscripts
sprawled on the mosaic floor. Apples had rolled away in all
directions, and in the middle, there were gleaming splinters of the
cup.</p>

<p>“All exact?” Baruk asked with triumphant
laughter. “The more I see of you, the more information to predict
every your word, move, deed. I already have enough for a week, a
month, half a year…”</p>

<p>Oleg gave Thomas a quick nod. “Sir Thomas,
it’s time to leave. He’s a lost man. And you, Baruk… you are making
a big mistake! A man, apart from his mighty mind, has a soul too!
And it’s unpredictable. It has very deep caves, hard to peep into.”
He turned to the entrance.</p>

<p>“You miserable!” Baruk shouted in fury. “Open
your eyes! Nothing on earth will save you from a terrible death
now! It’s clear enough even for you to see!”</p>

<p>Oleg stepped to the opened door, his face as
dark as a thundercloud. “Off chance you’ll know… what strength is
hidden in the soul,” he said in a dull voice, without looking
back.</p>

<p>He went past Thomas, and Thomas stepped to
the man in armchair, raised his giant sword. His arms were still
heavy, and the sword seemed to have the weight of a warhorse
armored for attack. Astonished Baruk goggled his eyes, wriggled
into the soft back of the armchair, jerked his trembling arms up in
fear, as if he could stop a heavy blade of high-class steel whetted
to match the sharpest razor.</p>

<p>The sword cut the air with a swish. There was
a squelch, a flop of wood on the floor, a gurgle, and a soft
slap.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back with disgust at the bloody
jumble: the knight had cut Baruk apart together with his armchair!
– and looked with amazement in Thomas’s face tired and serene.</p>

<p>Thomas picked up the knitted cap, wiped the
bloody blade clean with it. “Let’s go?” he asked briskly. “Or take
something from here?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head in astonishment. “No, my
innocent baby. We need nothing from this place. Let’s go.”</p>

<p>They went down the damned winding stairs, but
it was far easier than the same way up. Thomas livened up, the high
color came back to his deathly pale cheeks, as he spoke to Oleg
with animation. “At last I’ve guessed the true meaning of your
mysterious ‘off chance!’ I got not a damned thing of what you were
talking about, but I saw you twinned round with the black mage’s
spells! It was scary, but I recalled the nail of the Savior’s cross
in my sword hilt… I called for the Holy Virgin to help me withstand
the demon, a servant to Satan! You are a Pagan, after all, nearly a
relative to demons, so you feel awkward about fighting them. I
would never raise a hand against my kin myself. Otherwise I’d have
crushed those brothers long ago, and Krizhina would not shed her
bitter tears…”</p>

<p>As Thomas walked, he shifted the bag from his
back to belly, patted the prominence of the cup. Oleg recoiled
instinctively, alerted in expectance of either a flash or a thunder
to strike the naive knight who had just killed a cripple. But the
knight’s face was clean and calm, his honest eyes gleaming. He had
destroyed a fiend that came out of the Hell and went back there.
It’s sinful to kill a man, but killing a demon is a feat…</p>

<p>Oleg sighed, accepting the new reality of the
new culture, and mended his pace.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 25</p>

<p>They left Constantinople early in the morning
and paid a double duty for their leave. Thomas could not fathom it:
if they had paid their entrance to the city, why should they pay
when leaving it? The guards on the gate, seeing his enormous figure
and long sword, decided not to bully. They explained he had an
expensive armor on and could probably sell it to barbarian
chieftains, the enemies of the capital city. Thomas got furious and
yelled that so-called barbarian kingdoms had plenty of own weapons:
his armor was forged by Angles, while smiths in their rotten
Constantinople could only hammer bad iron and good steel was
brought there from East!</p>

<p>“And from North,” Oleg added helpfully. “From
Kiev, where good Haraluzhian swords are made. The Carolingian and
Merovingian swords are also valued more than the pieces of iron
made here…”</p>

<p>He paid the duty for both of them to angry
guards who’d already cried legionaries from neighbor posts for help
and surrounded Thomas. The knight was itching to fight. He spoke of
his knightly honor insulted, of the pride of noble Angles from the
banks of Don. At last, he asked Oleg with irritation, “Sir
wonderer, didn’t they offend us?”</p>

<p>By that time, they had passed the gate, but
Thomas kept his hand on the sword hilt. “So what?” Oleg replied
indifferently, immersed in his secret thoughts. “They offend, but
we don’t take offence.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked in his calm face with inquiry,
then spat angrily in the road dust. “I don’t understand you
Ruses.”</p>

<p>“Off chance you will, sometime…”</p>

<p>“Oh, that mysterious ‘off chance’ again!”</p>

<p>Oleg smiled absent-mindedly. Thomas noticed
that was the first time, for many days, when the wonderer did not
grip his charms every now and then. The dome of the sky, from one
horizon to another, was blue. The road went across green plains
with no winding, nor making loops like a running hare. On both
sides were well-groomed fields, neat white houses. Fat cattle were
moving lazily, as they grazed along the edge of the forest. The air
was clean and seemed especially sweet after the sewage stench of
Constantinople.</p>

<p>Horses ran briskly into a wide stream, raised
a cloud of silvery spray. Thomas looked with envy at the wonderer
who had no burden of armor on him and could act in Scythian way:
stoop from the saddle at full tilt, scoop the clean water with
hands, splash it on to his face, screwing up with joy.</p>

<p>Hares darted across their road, quails flew
up from the thick wheat. Twice the travelers saw a herd of wild
boars at the roadside. Involuntarily, Thomas seized his useless
sword, cast begging looks back at the wonderer. Oleg rode on,
straight as a candle, his face seemed to be carved of stone. Before
leaving the city, they had bought enough food for a week!</p>

<p>“Oh, how good!” Thomas said with enjoyment.
“Each new day makes the road shorter and takes me closer to my
snow-faced Krizhina… If no delays on the way, I’ll be on time. Even
two days ahead of it!”</p>

<p>Oleg pointed at the tall towers blazing with
crimson fire: they showed up at the very edge of their sight.
“Zolochev. There we shall part.”</p>

<p>Thomas darkened. “Sir wonderer…” he said
warily. “You are the companion I could not even dream of! Why can’t
we ride together for some more time? For a week, at least?”</p>

<p>“If there were a way past Constantinople,
we’d have parted earlier, Sir Thomas. But now all the broad space
of Europe lies before us! You road goes northwest, mine turns
northeast.”</p>

<p>“What is the name of your country?” Thomas
asked in depression. “I shall tell others of the Great Scythia… er…
Scythian Rus’…”</p>

<p>“Just say Rus’,” Oleg said again, for the
countless time. “Kievan Rus’! The Red Rus’. Ah, you will forget or
confuse all the same!”</p>

<p>Their horses, after they’d had a good rest in
Constantinople, tried to break into a trot, but Oleg held them in.
Thomas’s stallion bore six poods of the knight himself, two poods
of his steel armor, a pood of the saddle bag, the Holy Grail and
various camping thing in it, and also the horse cloth, sweat
clothes, the saddle, stirrups, girths, reins… <emphasis>And a tired horse
can hardly drag along its own ear.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas all but dislocated his neck, as he
turned it to watch the ruins in half a mile from the road. Being
more curious than it befitted a knight, he drove his horse in
gallop to them. Oleg muttered a curse but had to follow him. <emphasis>Any
rotten thing can be found in ruins like these.</emphasis></p>

<p>From the height of the saddle, Thomas gaped
at the majestic ruins. Standing on a hill, he had a good view of
the valley packed tightly with creepily gigantic remnants of
palaces, city walls, grand fountains, all sticking out of the dry
black soil, completely bare, with no grass growing on it. Some
goats rambled at the edge of that black earth but none dared to
step on it.</p>

<p>Thomas looked around, his glance fell on a
shepherd boy. “What great people lived here?” Thomas asked him.
“Which great country was it? What divine fire did destroy it?”</p>

<p>The shepherd boy blew his nose loudly, down
to the legs of the Frank’s horse, holding each of his nostrils in
turn with his thumb, wiped his palm against his dirty matted
burnoose and replied gloomily, “Here sleeps my grandfather, wise
Siyavush Sarhan-ogly. He knows all.”</p>

<p>Thomas’s eyes found the old man who was dozy
in the shade. The knight rode up to him, gave a bow from the
saddle. “Please tell me, wise man: what was it here?”</p>

<p>The old man lifted up slowly his senile eyes,
full of grief and sorrow, to look at the beautiful knight. “It was
the greatest of cities… With its people wealthy, healthy, and
beautiful. They had everything to be happy. But while a poor man
only cares of food, the one who has plenty of it seeks a
nourishment for mind and soul… Unfortunately, a false prophet was
passing across this land. Be damned into ages of ages the very name
of Einastia! It was how he called his teaching… You see, Frank,
what remained of the blooming city. And from that whole country,
whose name is now lost and forgotten.”</p>

<p>Thomas heard a move behind: Oleg turned his
horse and darted away in gallop. So pale and scared he looked that
Thomas rushed after him, having forgotten at once the shepherds,
ruins, and the Einastia itself. “Is your head aching from the sun?
Drink some water! Let’s get into the shade, for you to lie down and
have some rest!”</p>

<p>“No,” a hoarse groan came from the very depth
of the wonderer’s chest. “Let’s go… away from here.”</p>

<p>They failed to reach Zolochev by night: the
darkness caught them in a poor village. They spent a night there.
In the morning, they watered horses, checked the horseshoes, and
rode onto the road. Thomas smiled with restraint: in the short day
before, they made over twenty miles. <emphasis>The horse will get tired
over time, but even fifteen miles a day will bring me to the bank
of Don with five or six days in reserve.</emphasis></p>

<p>Early in the morning, they bumped into
ancient ruins again. Thomas knew those lands bore marks of many
extinct cities and nations: he saw many of them before, but none
were that colossal. With glassy eyes, he gazed at the monstrous
slabs. “How?.. Tell me, how could they break off such boulders?
<emphasis>And</emphasis> drag them here, to the heart of desert?.. You see, no
stone quarries close here!”</p>

<p>Oleg, grey and hunched in his saddle, looked
ahead with glassy eyes. His face showed despair, his wrinkles got
sharper, and the manly lines near his mouth turned bitter. “So they
could…” he whispered.</p>

<p>“But how?” Thomas exclaimed. He felt his hair
raising the helmet with such a force that its belt was about to
wrench his lower jaw. “<emphasis>How?</emphasis> The stones I trimmed were
hundred times smaller than these ones, but even those were a fit
for giants! I saw hundred slaves harnessed in to drag each one:
more hands that belts for them to seize!”</p>

<p>A dirty boy, clad in only a faded, colorless
loincloth, gaped at the two mighty Franks. “Do you know what it
was?” Thomas asked.</p>

<p>The boy shook his head, but as he saw the
mighty iron Frank watching him with expectation, he said shyly, “A
damned place.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Einastia,” the boy answered. He backed and
got white, as he spoke out this terrible word. “It’s Einastia!” He
ran away, showing a dirty pair of heels.</p>

<p>Thomas followed him with puzzled eyes. “It
seems to me I’ve heard of this doctrine before… But then, if I
recall it right, they ruined and destroyed everything… and here
they were building until they worked their guts out and perished…
No. I must have confused!”</p>

<p>“Certainly you must,” Oleg agreed hastily,
“as you have travelled a lot. Tell me, how did your detachment
storm into the gate of Jerusalem?”</p>

<p>Thomas livened up, the majestic slabs
forgotten at once. He assumed a dignified air: his back
straightened up, his chest well out, straightening the caved armor.
“Sir wonderer, <emphasis>that</emphasis> was a battle!.. A battle to tell our
grandchildren or even great-grandchildren of, as the courage and
valor of both the defenders of the Holy Sepulcher and the brave
warriors who came to take it is unlikely to be surpassed soon!”</p>

<p>The wonderer did not seem a quite attentive
listener, but Thomas was not petty and told the story willingly, in
detail. Gradually, Oleg mellowed. He even seemed to be looking in
the knight’s handsome manly face with joy, but then frowned,
gripped his charms.</p>

<p>“Wasn’t it my smile in all hundred teeth to
fright you?” Thomas mocked.</p>

<p>“It was,” Oleg replied briefly.</p>

<p>“Why?” Thomas alerted.</p>

<p>“You are too merry, and trouble always comes
unexpected… and, for some strange reason, always at the height of
fun. And teeth… you have only thirty-two of them, by the way.”</p>

<p>“So little?” Thomas was surprised. “I’d never
think… I’m a knight, however. My business is to knock teeth out in
jousting, not to count them. Let the literary men count, as their
academies taught them to…”</p>

<p>With light heart, he overrode the wonderer.
Back in Constantinople, he had slayed a fiend, an adept of Evil,
one of the knights of Satan. Who would dare to impede his
triumphant homecoming?</p>

<p>Oleg rode behind. Thomas kept glancing back
at him until his neck got sore. The wonderer grew darker and
darker, he let not the charms out of his fingers. At last, Thomas
felt the familiar creepy cold and got anxious. “Sir wonderer,
haven’t we got done with it in Constantinople? We defeated such a
mighty helper of Devil that souls in heaven frisk and sing praises
to us! What else?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” Oleg replied reluctantly. “I
feel danger, a great danger, but can’t fathom… no idea at all where
it may come from.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at the Pagan charms with
Christian indignation. Though they had saved their souls more than
once, giving a timely warning, but still they were Pagan, impious
things<emphasis>! If I could learn to tell fortunes by the cup, or the
nail in my sword hilt, there would probably be omens from Our Lady.
Far more reliable and, which is most important, Christian
ones.</emphasis></p>

<p>“You have almost nothing but beasts,” he
remarked, casting jealous glances at the charms. “Wolves, bears,
even dragons. And people so ugly… Some toads, birds, fish – what
for? And only one sword! And one stirrup, as it never happens to
be…”</p>

<p>Oleg gave a sudden start, as though waking
from a bad dream, looked around wildly. His eyes widened in fear,
as if he saw some monster springing up on their way. “Sir Thomas!
Sir Thomas, we need to pass between those stone hills as fast as we
can!”</p>

<p>Waiting for no response, he gave a shriek,
whipped his horse, and burst into gallop. Thomas measured the way
up to the hills by anxious eyes, spurred his horse. A destrier can
run in gallop no more than three or four hundred steps. The attack
of heavy chivalry is only to break the enemy’s lines, not to
pursue. The knights crush into the first rows, piercing the foes
with lances, then get stuck, slash heavily with swords and axes,
while their foamy warhorses try to keep their legs, which are
trembling with tiredness.</p>

<p>The horse Thomas had could carry the
heavy-armored rider for almost a mile, and there were less than it
to the hills pointed by the wonderer… but if danger waited there,
he would make a pretty nice fighter on a half-dead horse!</p>

<p>The horse was speeding up, turning a terrible
armored beast. Thomas could see no enemy, but his heart pounded
like a hammer, blood ran in vessels noisily and briskly. He warmed
up, felt a fit of the sacred battle rage that some warriors had in
common with ancient heroes and gods: furious Wotan, whose name
meant “incensed,” battle-fervent Beowulf, Ruslan, Tor, Boromir,
Aragorn…</p>

<p>Far ahead, the wonderer darted, like an
arrow, between two low hills formed by grey granite boulders
crumbling with age, topped with young green firs that reached for
the sky, their strong roots completing the ruin of hills.</p>

<p>Only once did the wonderer glance back: to
check whether the knight was following. <emphasis>The stubborn magician
kept calling him “a brass head,” despite the three or four thousand
years that had passed since the times of brass heads.</emphasis> Thomas’s
head was protected with good steel, no puny brass of Trojans or
Hellenes. <emphasis>He’s darting like a huge boulder shot from a catapult.
The Devil himself will not stop a brave knight at full
tilt!</emphasis></p>

<p>When Thomas’s stallion dashed between the
hills – a hundred of steps from one to another! – the ground under
his hooves gave a shake, a heavy rumble came from below. The horse
stumbled at a tilt, lost ground, and Thomas strained in mortal
fear, as he imagined himself flying heels over head in full armor.
But the horse kept its hooves and mended its pace. They darted past
the hill. Thomas spotted it was no hill but a ruin of very old
tower or fortress… His peripheral vision caught a terrible glimpse
of huge stone slabs coming apart, in smoke and thunder. The roots
of young firs cracked, the ground opened wide, puffing black and
grey smoke out… and within it, some monstrous, inhuman thing was
rising from the bowels of earth!</p>

<p>He felt a blow of heat on his back. The horse
wheezed in terror. The wonderer reined up far ahead, waving to
Thomas. His horse pranced, eager to rush away from the scary place.
“Quick!” Thomas heard a bitter shout. “You still have time!”</p>

<p>Thomas bent to the front arch. His horse
rattled, his ears laid back as a hare’s. The wonderer turned his
stallion, wrenching his lower jaw with the bridle. Thomas darted
past them, only caught a glimpse of pale face and eyes goggled with
despair. The road flew under the hooves evenly – a good one made by
Romans! – but his horse had a rattling breath, bloodshot eyes, and
the grey strip of earth was splitting into pebbles, grass, and
trampled clay.</p>

<p>“Keep up, keep up!” Oleg cried out like a
spell. He overrode Thomas again, as if there was a more terrible
thing ahead and he hurried to see it first, to ward off, to protect
his friend. Thomas saw the bow, sword, and arrows on Oleg’s back
and his fear grew stronger: <emphasis>the wonderer had not even seized a
weapon!</emphasis></p>

<p>He heard a heavy crash ahead, as if a
mountain collapsed. The ground under him twitched to and fro again.
A terrible roar made Thomas’s blood run cold. The roar was uttered
by no animal but something dreadful, neither human nor beastly.
<emphasis>A cry of pain and rage that a livened Tower of David could utter
when the boiling tar went streaming down its walls!</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas took a chance to glance back. He
gasped, went cold, his fingers all but dropped the reins. The hill
had collapsed, like a molehill, big rocks rolled down onto the
road. From a huge crater, some dirty-green monsters were climbing
out: each as tall as a mounted man but thrice that long, more
massive, covered with bony plates that resembled stone slabs. The
massive head looked like a forger, if that could be the size of a
proper barrel, topped with horns and spikes, its jaws belched with
black smoke, shot crimson flames out, eyes hid in the narrow
slit.</p>

<p>The horse staggered, began to stumble. Thomas
glanced back in fear. The first monster crept down, from the ruined
hill onto the road, sniffed the tracks loudly and rushed, in giant
leaps, after him. The other beasts were also coming: their
bright-green bodies covered with duckweed from top to toe, as
though they’d just come up from underground bog, each had a sharp
bony crest along its back, jaws looked like a burning stove. The
earth gave a moan when they dashed after the riders. Making heavy
leaps, they looked like giant frogs whose bodies were stretched in
a jump.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Thomas cried desperately.
“With deep regret I inform you that you’ll have to rely only on
yourself! I can’t be helpful anymore: my horse will fall in
forty-eight steps…”</p>

<p>“Won’t he make hundred?” the wonderer
bellowed, as he pulled up abruptly.</p>

<p>“I know my weight, my armor…”</p>

<p>“Then make the rest fifty-two by shanks’
mare!”</p>

<p>The horse rocked on the run, then fell.
Thomas had taken his heavy boots out from iron stirrups, so he
jumped down heavily. His tired legs failed him, he sprawled, face
first, in the road mud and dust. A strong hand yanked him up by
shoulder, all but wrenched it out, a horrible voice roared in his
ear, “Run to that oak!”</p>

<p>Thomas forced himself to run as fast as he
could. <emphasis>Right or wrong the wonderer is, he flounders, not waits
meekly for the death to come.</emphasis> Thomas darted like a deer, jumped
over logs and rocks. He felt amazed with own might but then saw the
wonderer’s horse galloping by his side: Oleg held the knight’s
cloak behind firmly, helping him in his run and jumps.</p>

<p>The roar and crash behind grew louder. They
felt heat, smelt burning. Thomas tried to pull out his sword as he
ran, but Oleg’s hand hit his elbow painfully. Thomas did not
object: he only tried to survive in that run. Dying on the run
would be a shame to a knight who spent several years running around
the castle with a heavy rock on his shoulders, as that was a common
way of training young Angles…</p>

<p>The oak was getting closer, but everything
swung and blurred in his eyes, his knees became weak. Thomas could
not fall: the strong hand dragged him along. Suddenly he sank into
icy cold, got stuck in it, like a fly in amber, but the wonderer
yelled, pulled him ahead. With dim surprise, Thomas found himself
up to the neck in water. The wonderer’s hot horse snorted and
hoofed nearby, splashing Thomas all over. He seemed to hear his
armor, red-hot with the mad run, hissing in the water and see the
whitish steam raising.</p>

<p>Oleg dragged Thomas out onto the bank. “Up
the slope!” he croaked, hoarse and panting with effort. “Water
keeps them.”</p>

<p>He vaulted off, his horse remained on
trembling legs, all four spread wide apart, and the two men ran on…
Precisely, the wonderer started to run but then came back to seize
Thomas, in his armor with water gushing out of all slits, dragged
the knight, as heavy as a mountain, made him move on. Thomas often
fell in exhaustion, his wet armor got caked in earth, dry leaves,
splinters. A frantic wasp flew into his open visor and stung his
lip.</p>

<p>The wonderer yelled for him to hurry.
Finally, Thomas burst after him into thick green shrubs and fell
down, motionless. There was a din in his head, a clatter of hammers
in his ears, his heart trying to break the steel armor from
inside.</p>

<p>The wonderer’s legs were jutting out from the
bush ahead. With effort, Thomas dragged his body, as heavy as a
dead armored horse, to fall next to him. The wonderer was watching
the road through the twigs he’d moved apart. Thomas, faintly
surprised at own endurance, managed a turn on his side, looked out
too.</p>

<p>In hundred steps down the slope, a wide
stream was gleaming in the bright sun: so shallow that one could
clearly see small colored stones on its bottom, pebbles, water
plants, and even small fishes, shiny in the sunlight. Thomas
groaned with vexation. <emphasis>I had such a hard time crossing it as
though it were a sea. I all but drowned!</emphasis></p>

<p>On the other side of the stream, huge
monsters, about ten of them, were stamping their feet, hitting each
other with bone shells, bursting with mechanical roars. Thomas
convulsed, dug his iron elbows deeper into the earth, clenched both
his jaws and fists. Once he had seen a fire-spitting mountain: huge
rocks flying out of its truncated peak, with terrible thunder, the
Hell’s fire and black smoke rising from it, and the blazing earth,
fiery and melted, streaming down the slope. The beasts seemed to
have climbed out of that mountain, which was called volcano. <emphasis>In
the name of the Pagan blacksmith god, but, in truth, there is no
smithy underground but Hellish stoves for sinners. The Lord, in his
mercy, sometimes allows people to see from a distance what lies
below, for them to fear and abandon sin…</emphasis></p>

<p>“Secret Seven,” the wonderer said with
unbearable bitterness. “Unchain these monsters! A savagery.”</p>

<p>“Secret Six now,” Thomas replied as firmly as
he could. “Where were they chained?”</p>

<p>“There below. In the times of old gods, these
beasts lived on earth, as numerous as rabbits… Then heroes
destroyed them. The first Secret One hid the remaining ones inside
a rocky mountain.”</p>

<p>“For such an occasion?”</p>

<p>“Just to save them from extinction. He didn’t
think much of it, just saved… The first Secret Ones were powerful
sorcerers, always at war with great heroes, the founders of new
tribes and nations.”</p>

<p>“The Secret Ones have always been
demons?”</p>

<p>Oleg hesitated, looked sideways in the
knight’s honest face, then turned away, replied reluctantly, as
though forcing himself, “Wars would not last that long… neither
they would start so often if only one side were right. Have you
rested?”</p>

<p>“I need two or three years of it…” Thomas
said in a miserable voice.</p>

<p>“Stand up, Sir Thomas! Your beautiful
Krizhina’s waiting. Beasts are slow-minded, but soon they’ll guess
to fell that giant oak. <emphasis>Beavers</emphasis> would have already guessed
that! Then they’ll drag it here and throw across the water to reach
the other bank.”</p>

<p>Oleg rose, and Thomas, with a groan, got up
to his trembling feet. Oleg watched him with admiration and
sympathy: the knight had not taken the smallest iron piece off,
carrying steadfastly the two poods of steel on himself and the
heavy two-handed sword!</p>

<p>“Why don’t they cross… as we did?” Thomas
asked in a choking voice.</p>

<p>“Born in a hot desert. The ancient one, so
scorching that… They <emphasis>freeze</emphasis> here, Sir Thomas! Really
freeze!”</p>

<p>Thomas, who was dying of heat, sobbed of
either exhaustion or envy for those animals who were cold, then
dragged himself after the wonderer. They forced their way through
shrubs, climbed up a long rocky slope, hurried across a steep
hillside. Tired, Thomas kept bumping into huge boulders, his armor
thundered, as if he were falling from the wall of the patrician
house down onto the stone-paved street in Constantinople. He hissed
with helpless rage, like a furious snake. “Where we run?”</p>

<p>“Save your breath!” The wonderer broke
through the green thicket, held the branches for Thomas. He forgot
that the knight’s armor was impenetrable even for sabers and spears
and the visor was down to save his eyes from sharp twigs. The
ground was trembling beneath Thomas, as though it were one of the
beasts running, about to jump on Oleg’s shoulders.</p>

<p>Thomas breathed hoarsely, like a winded
horse, his lips in yellow foam. Stumbling at every step, he groped
for the sword hilt and rattled out, “Sir… wonderer… I… stay…”</p>

<p>“Run!”</p>

<p>There was a sudden terrible roar behind, then
a heavy strike. The ground vibrated, they heard a fast crackle of
shrubs and trees. Oleg grabbed Thomas, dragged him on, pushing and
kicking, through the thickset up the slope. “They’ve crossed!”</p>

<p>“I shan’t…” Thomas forced out. “They’ll come
up… I saw their paws… Better fight with honor… Face to face…”</p>

<p>“If only you could! Swords do no harm to
them!”</p>

<p>“I’m k-knight… Unworthy… like hare…”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, fortify your heart! Run is
courageous, and fight is cowardly!”</p>

<p>Thomas did not get it: his head was pounding
again. Beyond himself, urged on by the wonderer, he dragged his
feet to the hill crest, long alike a lizard. Far below, a column of
red dust was driven by wind along the broad road that curved round
the hill’s foot. Across the road, there was a yellow wall of ripe
wheat, and just under the hill on which the travelers stood
half-dead, some pilgrims plodded in rows by two or three: ragged,
half-naked or in torn cloaks, with heads shaved or overgrown with
long hair. <emphasis>Three or four scores in total.</emphasis> All pilgrims
looked miserable, but almost each one dragged a huge chain,
fetters, or iron rings.</p>

<p>“If you don’t want Krizhina cry her eyes out,
run to them!” Oleg breathed out in a parched voice.</p>

<p>“But I don’t…” Thomas felt a strong shove on
back, made two steps involuntarily, lest he fall, and got dragged
on, as though by a rope: trees and shrubs rushed to meet him, he
moved his legs very quickly, in fear of ramming into a thick tree
or stumbling over a stone. He clutched at branches as he ran, but
adequate bushes seemed to be left behind and those he met were
feeble, tearing easily, like rotten cloths, leaving green twigs in
hands. The twenty-three stones of his bone, muscle, and steel
dashed down the slope like an avalanche. Stifled with heat and
flicker in his eyes, he began to dream of bumping into a tree, or
even a boulder as tall as himself…</p>

<p>The greenery finished abruptly, he darted in
the dust. His legs failed to bear up the body that suddenly became
heavier, the ground jumped to meet him, he clashed face with it to
face, heard a crunch and a crackle, felt hot and salty in his
mouth, as he was rolled and finally sprawled in the hot dust.</p>

<p>When he looked up madly, a shaggy old man was
standing over him: with a spade-like beard, clad in a tattered
cloak, all in patches and rents, an iron chain over his shoulder,
each link the size of a hand, its end dragged in the road dust.
“What a wonder is it?” the old man asked in a startled voice.</p>

<p>Thomas set both hands on the ground, sat up
with effort. He felt a stitch under his ribs, shook his head,
trying to regain his senses.</p>

<p>A heavy body rolled down swiftly from the
steep slope, crushing through shrubs. Thomas heard a scream, “In
the name of Great Rod! Of Christ, Buddha, Mahomet, Wotan and all
the gods! Help!!!”</p>

<p>Oleg jumped onto the road, with his eyes
goggled madly, soaked and shaggy all over, like a mouse thrown
ashore by the surf. The old man patted sedately his grey beard –
luxuriant, though having burdocks and burrs – and shot a sharp
glance from under his overhanging prickly eyebrows. “If we can…
What’s the matter?”</p>

<p>“We are chased!”</p>

<p>“In this world someone is always chased. Come
to ours.”</p>

<p>“I was in it,” Oleg said quickly. His broad
chest was heaving wildly, he kept glancing over his shoulder. “Now
I’m in the Great Reclusion.”</p>

<p>His fingers made a strange sign: so fast that
Thomas could not see it, but the old man’s eyes widened. The
pilgrim bowed his head – unwillingly, as Thomas spotted – and spoke
in a different tone, “We recognize… But we are still in the Small
Reclusion, which, as you know, prescribes us to leave mundane
affairs behind.”</p>

<p>“A special case!” Oleg cried. He glanced over
again, with fright. A hollow rumble was heard from that side, the
ground was quivering.</p>

<p>The old man spoke back strictly, in a
rattling voice that seemed derisive to Thomas. “For you? Temptation
has many faces, you know… We left mundane deeds behind.”</p>

<p>A mighty roar came from behind the crest,
then a crackle of broken shrubs. Big rocks flew down the slope onto
the road, ahead of the monsters who’d brought them down.</p>

<p>Thomas rose to his weak feet, drew out his
sword and stood at the roadside. “Sir wonderer! Haven’t we fought
just in two?”</p>

<p>Oleg cast an incensed look at the old man,
behind whom the silent pilgrims stood in a dense crowd, their eyes
dull and lackluster, their thin swarthy hands clutching thick
staffs. The wind stirred their rags with disgust. Thomas smelt
unwashed bodies, wrinkled his noble nose, and moved away to the
very edge of the road.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Oleg sighed. “Our last battle, Sir
Thomas!” He pulled his huge sword out slowly, walked tiredly up to
Thomas. The knight looked slantwise in his companion’s sad face.
<emphasis>Not a hint of fear in it, only dead tiredness.</emphasis> Thomas felt
proud for such a valiant friend sent to him by Holy Virgin. If they
die, they’d be fighting to their last breath. <emphasis>Let the Hell’s
beasts be invincible, a true man won’t give his life away that
simply! One should fight, kick, and even bite as long as he can.
Let Satan have no easy victory!</emphasis></p>

<p>The ground trembled. The green cover of the
hill vanished, as the grey-green wave rolled over it. There was
crackle and crash, stones dropped. What the monsters left behind,
was black friable soil: no shrubs on it anymore, all twigs and even
leaves gone, trampled into the ground along with rocks.</p>

<p>Thomas planted his feet wider apart, gave
Oleg a cheering-up glance – the last one in that life! – gripped
the sword with both hands. The monsters rushed down from the
mountain, unstoppable. Only one of them spotted the knight’s
gleaming figure on the way, mistook it for an iron pillar dug into
the earth, tried to halt, setting its paws on the ground ahead, but
was driven on down the slope, ripping it open as though with four
giant ploughs.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 26</p>

<p>Thomas bellowed, forcing the battle fury up
in himself, stepped forward. The animal was driven up to him.
Screaming, Thomas brought his sword down on the huge head covered
with bony plates. Splinters flew about, like small silvery fish,
the sword was all but wrenched out of hands, as if he had struck
with all his might on an anvil, fingers got numb and aching. Thomas
could barely keep the sword, so heavy it got at once, his mouth
cold and dry, his heart stopped beating. In place of three thick
horns on the beast’s snout, there now were only two – and a
slantwise-cut stub in place of the third one. The monster uttered
an insulted roar, darted on his enemy. Thomas was burnt with heat
and fell down at once, as the beast shoved him with its side.
Thomas rolled, his sword still in hand, jumped up studiedly and
struck again: on the long green moss-covered tail that was sliding
past him. The sword was cast away, its blow left a whitish stripe
on the tail, and Thomas saw it was a different animal, while the
one with cut-down front horn, roaring madly, broke into the lines
of perplexed pilgrims.</p>

<p>He heard crash and roar, caught glimpses of
horrible paws, as the huge animal was rolling on the ground in a
ball, crushing rocks and leaving a wide stripe of dead soil,
trampled to the hardness of stone, behind. Terrified, Thomas could
not believe his eyes: the monster and the wonderer had grappled
each other, both roared, wrestled, rolled on the ground… Thomas
yelled, rushed to them with his sword raised, but a mountain bumped
into his side, his armor crunched, and Thomas was blown away like a
leaf torn off the tree.</p>

<p>The earth trembled, as if mountains were
collapsing. The mad roar was about to break his skull. Thomas
managed to raise himself a bit, feeling as though all of his bones
were… more than broken: reduced to hash, with the largest fragment
as big as his nail. With a moan, he leaned against his sword. A
green log hit his legs at once. Falling flat, Thomas caught a
glimpse of the animal, which had knocked him down with the very end
of its tail. The beast roared with pain and fury: the wonderer took
a grip of its jaws and was tearing them apart, as though to look
into the red crater of throat. The foaming blood, strangely white,
gushed out. The animal gave a howl, waving its paws blindly. One of
them caught the wonderer’s belt, the strong claws about to welt
him. With a dirty curse, the wonderer left the jaws and gripped
momentarily, with two hands, the animal’s thick paw. Before Thomas
could say “mom,” the paw gave a dry crunch, as though a thick pole
broken, the terribly roaring beast collapsed on its side, started
to beat the air convulsively with the rest three paws. The wonderer
jumped aside, picked up his sword.</p>

<p>Thomas got up to his fours, had time to see
another monstrous animal jumping on the wonderer before something
pounced on Thomas’s back with a crunch, pressed him into the hard
trampled ground. He lay half-stunned, waiting for terrible jaws to
touch the back of his head, to come together once and bite his
armor through, like a forest nut, and spit out the iron shell after
having milled him, Thomas Malton, a noble Angle from the banks of
Don, with strong teeth…</p>

<p>Suddenly the noise in his head subsided, but
he heard roar, dull thumps, and shouts instead. With effort, he
turned in the pit, which his iron armor had made in his fall, to
see the blue sky and, against the blue, the bustle of monstrous
bodies and clawed paws.</p>

<p>Then the wonderer cropped up into his
eyesight. Oleg breathed heavily, his face wild, his eyes goggled
still. Blood trickled down from his forehead, poured over eyebrows.
Irritated, the wonderer wiped it off with his blooded palm. “Are
you alive, Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>Thomas tried to rise but fell prone: his arms
were fragile as grass blades. Oleg supported him by shoulder. “And…
beasts?” Thomas asked in a husky voice.</p>

<p>Oleg waved away. “All right. Fighting, what
else?”</p>

<p>Thomas sat up, shook his head, trying to
regain his senses. He was sitting among broken and squashed twigs,
limpid juice oozing from them, their leaves carpeting the ground.
From the roadside, crash and heavy rumble were coming, along with
heavy strikes and mad shouts.</p>

<p>“Lie down,” Oleg said. His breast rose
frequently, the air rattling and howling in it, like a snowstorm in
a chimney. He wiped the blood off his forehead again. His eyebrow
was matted, his copper-red hair stuck up in a strange way. “Lie…
They’ll cope on their own.”</p>

<p>Thomas got up with effort, leaning on his
sword, like an old man on a staff. He turned to the road: that last
blow – with a tail, as far as he could recall – had flung him past
the roadside. On the road, in puffing bitter dust, inconceivable
things were going on: the last beasts had run down the slope,
roaring and thundering, and pilgrims darted about, brandishing
their staffs and chains. Three monsters, with their heads smashed
and spines broken, lay at the roadside, their bony shields,
impossibly thick, gaping with terrible cracks. Thomas was startled
to see the head of the nearest monster flattened, as though between
the hammer and the anvil of unthinkable size, its hind paw torn out
with a bit of meat. Huge white gristles seen in the horrible wound,
still oozing with blood, which made the ground hiss and swell in
blisters.</p>

<p>The last animal, a late one, thundered down
the slope, came running into the old, grey-haired man, the one who
had denied assistance to travelers so coldly. Displeased, he
stepped aside, socked the beast on head with his staff. Thomas
expected to see the immediate death of old fool, but the colossal
head, armored in thickest shell and resembling a granite boulder,
cracked under the staff blow, broke in halves, like a rotten egg.
Small splinters flew in all directions, blood gushed out in thick
gurgling mass. The animal’s broken mug hit the ground. The beast,
unable to stop at once, turned overhead and remained on its back,
its broad crest pressed down with a crunch.</p>

<p>Along the road, in hundred steps both on the
left and on the right from it, pilgrims were hitting the beasts
angrily with staffs, crutches, chains, and fetters. The air was
full of terrible crunch and crash, death rattles and dreadful
howls. Stupefied, Thomas saw that one pilgrim seized a monstrous
creature by its thick tail, yanked it up into the air, whirled
overhead, as though to knock down other animals with it as a club –
but there was a loud crackle, the green tail remained in hands,
while the beast flew over the road and collapsed, with bony
thunder, onto the trampled shrubs. The suddenness of it made the
pilgrim fall on his back, into a puddle of whitish blood and
entrails of another dead animal. The man was thin, yellow, his face
gaunt, his skinny body covered with rags.</p>

<p>Thomas jumped up in fear when a heavy hand
fell with a clang on his shoulder. “They’re almost done with it.
Let’s go to them.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t they angry with us?” Thomas said, his
voice was unsteady. “We brought the beasts on them… Did you run
here on purpose?”</p>

<p>“I felt our Russian pilgrims going,” Oleg
replied evasively.</p>

<p>The last animal was finished off by crutches,
its shell cracked, as though beaten by iron logs, blood spurting
out. One pilgrim threw away with disgust his crutch, with green
moss and small bone splinters stuck to it. The crutch fell in front
of Thomas, went into the stone-hard ground for a length of hand.
Driven by natural gratitude, Thomas hurried to stoop for it, to
pick up and clean, as it was not disgraceful even for a king to
render services to ecclesiastics, even those of other
religions…</p>

<p>His iron fingers slid off with a grinding
sound. Thomas get none of it, gripped the crutch with both hands,
hooking it from below, and jerked up – but it seemed to have grown
into the earth. Thomas felt as though gripping the middle of the
protruding root of a two-hundred-year-old oak tree. He saw a
friendly banter in Oleg’s tired face, bit his lip, frowned, took a
firm stand and yanked the crutch up with all his might.</p>

<p>He felt his legs breaking the hard crust of
trampled earth, sinking into it, but that amazing crutch had only
one of its ends raised a bit! Thomas went crimson, trying to hold
it, but the crutch slipped off, squelched on the ground. That time
Thomas could see, for sure that was neither his imagination nor
illusion, that the earth was shaken with its fall and the crunch
subsided as if it were mud, not well-trodden soil, as solid as
stone.</p>

<p>Oleg embraced Thomas, urged him to the
battlefield. “Leave it, or you’ll bust a gut… No less than forty
poods of iron in that staff. Their chains and fetters the
same.”</p>

<p>Thomas was astonished. “Why?”</p>

<p>“To make them heavier,” Oleg explained
shortly.</p>

<p>Thomas turned his head, looked with mistrust,
but the wonderer’s face was absolutely honest. “Why?” the knight
asked again.</p>

<p>“That’s a feat, as Ruses see it. Asceticism!
It’s only hard to defeat a dragon until you try to defeat yourself…
No beast that brutal, strong, and cunning. A beast that always
prevails: by ruse or by caress, by stubbornness or sweet
words…”</p>

<p>They came up to the wonderers who were seated
tiredly on the huge bodies of dead monsters. Some pilgrims breathed
heavily, scowled, one waved his blooded hand, others had a quite
talk with their heads close.</p>

<p>The old man with spade-like beard, his cloak
even more torn, met Thomas and Oleg with his shrill senile voice.
“Who is it, eh? Just two shrimps, but look – beasts from the very
hell run after them! So big knobs indeed? Hares would do to hunt
you down!”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, threw his hand on the sword
hilt. Oleg seized his elbow, spoke back peacefully, “Who judges by
clothing… My companion – he’s from the land of Angles, the former
Tin Isles<sup>17</sup> – had also thought you, in your
rags, would not do the beasts!”</p>

<p>“Tin Isles?” the pilgrim leader said, still
annoyed. “Ah, the Land of Red Wolves?.. Where Taurus led the Old
Believers to?.. I see, no way for them to know old ways there. And
you didn’t tell him either?”</p>

<p>“I’ve been chock-full with other matters,”
Oleg replied.</p>

<p>A hunched old man came up to them, dragging
his swollen feet. The end of his dirty grey beard was tucked under
his rope belt. He had a thick iron chain dangling on his neck: each
link of it as large as a fist, its end dragged on the ground,
leaving a wide trace. With his fingers burnt on that plain-looking
crutch, Thomas looked at the chain closely – and suddenly felt it
had more iron in each of its links that his heavy armor in total!
“Let’s stop for dinner?” the old man asked his leader in a hopeful
voice.</p>

<p>The old man with spadish beard snapped back
angrily. “Again?.. You had your meal yesterday! Enough to wait till
supper tomorrow. The beast within should be tamed, its spine
broken!”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced around furtively. The
wonderers sat in rows on the backs of dead animals, sad and
ruffle-feathered like hungry crows in the rain. One walked among
the monsters, prodded their jaws with his staff, examined their
teeth. His belt had a gloomy glitter: broad and tight, made of
metal with some strange writing carved in.</p>

<p>The pilgrim leader followed the glance of the
gleaming armored knight, his sharp eyes flickered with some
emotion. “Well, we can have some rest. But don’t give up to
temptation, don’t give up! The servants of Black God wait for you
to… As the sun sets, we shall plod on. Less heat and flies on the
way.”</p>

<p>They made a fire far away from the road. The
dead monsters were dragged into a huge pit and thrown over with
earth and stones. However, the pilgrims had cut a couple of animals
first: with knives or bare hands. Thomas turned away: he could not
bear to see the dreadful entrails that had nothing in common with
those of deer, boars, or even bears.</p>

<p>The pilgrim leader saw to the liver being
taken from the biggest animals. Soon after, strange fragrances
started to drift over the green valley. Thomas sat humbly where
Oleg had seated him, his nostrils sniffed the fresh-roast liver
avidly, but his eyes recoiled in fright from the far road. He could
see it as a twisting fair stripe with strange spots of dark, broken
in one place and restored with great effort after, crawling out
from pools of blood. From far away, a carriage was coming, attended
by riders. <emphasis>What would they think as they see the road flooded
with strange blood, all in dents and furrows that tell of a
terrible battle?</emphasis> However, a light wind had already raised a
cloud of grey dust to bury at least some part, if not all of it.
<emphasis>By the time they have enough of their marvel and reach the
nearest village, there will be no traces on the road at all and the
words of astonished travelers will be taken as tales.</emphasis></p>

<p>When Oleg, after a long talk he had with the
leader of pilgrims, came back to Thomas, the knight whispered in
amazement, “I don’t understand… They are heroes!”</p>

<p>“They were,” Oleg dismissed.</p>

<p>“What do you mean? They are! They scattered
the beasts, slew, and crushed!’”</p>

<p>Oleg cheered up and laughed. “Sir Thomas, one
can live a life but remain a child. Heroes come out of childhood
earlier than other people, as they in early age get everything
other men can only dream of: glory, money, power, and princesses…
Heroes have time to get fed up with that, to understand that’s not
what really matters…”</p>

<p>“And become wonderers?” Thomas asked with
distrust.</p>

<p>“They come out of heroes, anyway. In search
of themselves. Many of them become wonderers to obtain Truth in
their travels. They try to pick the easiest way: thinking the Truth
has already been found somewhere and all they need is come and see
it.”</p>

<p>“And what is real?”</p>

<p>“Truth is to be found in your own self. One
man meets God on his way, another – while staying at home. Isn’t
that true?”</p>

<p>The pilgrim leader sliced the monster’s liver
in big pieces, gave one to Thomas and one to Oleg. Thomas took it
with both hands and thought, with a gloomy irony, that old man with
hungry eyes must be a real glutton. <emphasis>After eating such a slice,
one can easily do without food not only till next evening but for
whole week!</emphasis> Next to him, Oleg crunched the roast liver loudly.
As he gnawed deeper in it, blood oozed from the raw inner part.
Oleg’s eyes were thoughtful as if he watched some very far thing
beyond this world. He paid no heed at all to his bloody
fingers.</p>

<p>Thomas made himself eat it. <emphasis>Who else, in
all the Crusader army, can boast having tasted the liver of the
Hell’s beast?</emphasis></p>

<p>On the other side of him, a gaunt ragged
pilgrim was sitting, a thick hefty chain on his shoulders. He
hadn’t take it off even for dinner. By stealth, Thomas tried to
move the end that lay on the ground but the chain seemed to be
rooted in it, pressed into the soil at a finger depth.</p>

<p><emphasis>I don’t understand</emphasis>, he spoke sadly to
himself, <emphasis>what strength do these strange men seek, which is more
than strength? What power over power? What wonderful things are
they going to achieve by denying… Goodness, a fool can see</emphasis>
<strong><emphasis>what</emphasis></strong> <emphasis>they deny!</emphasis></p>

<p>He felt strange, as though he spent all his
life walking past the treasure visible to everyone except for him,
a blind one. Would he also see it if he stripped off his armor,
slipped into rags, denied the joys of life and walked bare-headed
out in the rain and snow, as a beggar?</p>

<p>He chewed mechanically, his eyes fixed on the
emaciated ragged men, on their tatters, chains and fetters, their
scabbed bare feet. “I can’t get it…” he whispered sadly. “Can’t
get…”</p>

<p>Oleg darkened, turned away. <emphasis>Will a worm of
doubt infest even this beautiful, healthy, muscular body? Will the
knight in his prime, to the terror of his family and friends, take
his armor off, leave for a cave or join the wandering
pilgrims?</emphasis></p>

<p>After all, it is the easiest way to seek
Truth. To sever from the noisy base world, false and venal as it
is, to cut yourself off with the wall of reclusion, to stay one on
one with God. No birth without pain. Only pain and suffering can
wake up the soul: it either aches or sleeps. <emphasis>However, ordinary
reclusion is not the strongest pain. Mind the Great one!</emphasis></p>

<p>Having parted with the wonderers, they
plodded to the nearest village and bought a horse for Thomas. They
would got it for Oleg too if not the ill wind that brought the
host’s wife to. She went screaming, dug her nails in her husband’s
face. All Oleg and Thomas could do was to save their purchased
horse by a hasty retreat. Thomas gave a hint of offering twice that
much for the second horse but Oleg dragged him out of the house.
“This land is rich, one village close to another. We’ll buy a
better one.”</p>

<p>“I feel awkward, sir wonderer! I, a crusader
knight, have a horse, and a priest…”</p>

<p>Oleg gave a restrained smirk. At the
beginning of the journey, the valiant knight was not
conscience-stricken by the sight of the exhausted pilgrim dragging
himself, covered with road dust and mud, by the side of his
stallion in his luxurious cloth. <emphasis>The old god prescribed a noble
knight to be high and a common man low, and Christ, the young god,
consolidated and sanctified it! Man is eager to slip into the bad,
but he can also come to humanity rather quickly.</emphasis> “Sir Thomas,”
he said in a promising voice. “Up from that hill, I’ll be riding
such a stallion that yours will seem a plow horse next to him!”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted his jealous gaze to the horse
he rode. He managed to buy a huge, mighty draft horse, which had
evidently been brought there from the lands of North. <emphasis>I paid
thrice its price, but what is money when knightly honor is at
stake?</emphasis> And that coin had come to them easily, according to the
wonderer who claimed having either found it or taken from a hare
running by.</p>

<p>As the wonderer walked, he often tip-fingered
his charms. Thomas looked at them with dual feeling. The wooden
things were impious, Pagan, but the Holy Virgin, in her
unfathomable mercy, allowed their existence still. <emphasis>Nothing on
earth is done without Her leave.</emphasis></p>

<p>“If we don’t buy there,” Thomas said
decisively, “we’ll change!” On the way ahead, he could see five
houses, a score of sheds, and the sweep of the well reaching for
the sky. A goat for sale was unlikely to be found there, not to
mention horse, so he would have to dismount, getting his body
troubled but soul relieved.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced slantwise at the knight who rode
like a tower bound with iron: unshakeable and indestructible. His
blue eyes went dark and dim, as though his brave soul was wandering
in doubts, so unusual to it. He seemed to be still among the
wonderers, smelling unwashed bodies, hearing the clang of heavy
chains, seeing horrible sores left by fetters that had worn the
live flesh through to the bone. And he recalled his valiant friend,
also a wonderer, explaining in a strange pitiful voice, with his
eyes turned away, that only wonderers were humans, while others –
pre-humans. Back then, Thomas had flared up with just indignation,
righteous fury for the profane words, but now he returned to them
silently, turning them this and that way.</p>

<p>When they were eating the roast liver, Oleg
asked venomously what is the difference between man and animals.
Thomas blurted out that man can speak and animals can’t, so the
difference is speech and mind. But Oleg said that animals also
speak to each other: in howls, chirps, or squeaks. So man is also
the cleverest of animals… and the most violent, as he even kills
the likes of him, but still only an animal. What is the difference
indeed?</p>

<p><emphasis>May it be fetters?</emphasis> Thomas thought
angrily. He cast curious furtive glances at the wonderer who walked
on the right of his horse, raising road dust with each step. The
wonderer got grey all over, his bronzed shoulders and jack of the
same color, his face glistened with sweat.</p>

<p><emphasis>Surely</emphasis>, Thomas went on angrily, <emphasis>no
animal will impose fetters or other heavy thing on himself. Neither
will any man, common or noble. And what is man? According to the
wonderer, that’s still an animal, a pre-human. But there are men
who came from animals into humans. They are few, that’s why they
seem strange and unfathomable to most people. But what is
fathomable to everyone? The one who’s neither a fool nor a wise
man, not too weak and not too strong, his heart neither too faint
nor too brave… And strongmen, wise men, heroes, prophets – they are
all strange. They seem odd to ordinary people.</emphasis> Someone might
have found strange even the quest of his: from a rich peaceful
land, from own castle on Don into the strange world where death
waited for him at every step, where he starved, suffered, had hard
times, fell from tall towers, often slept, like a dog, on a hay of
straw… And was it normal that he kept bearing the mortally
dangerous cup, instead of leaving it and rushing to embrace his
loved one?</p>

<p>The wonderer walked deep in thought. Thomas,
high in his saddle, was the first to notice a rider on the road far
ahead. “Oho! I’m afraid we’ll have to fight!”</p>

<p>The rider rushed towards them in heavy
gallop. Thomas cheered up, leaving his reflections, so uncommon for
a noble knight. The stranger’s horse looked like a rock of black
basalt, while the rider looked a smaller rock, but massive, heavy,
menacingly huge all the same. Black crows were flying over him.
Thomas felt cold between his shoulder blades as he grasped those
were no crows but clods of earth hit off by the giant
horseshoes.</p>

<p>The stranger was impossibly broad in
shoulders, thickset and stout, some ancient beastly might felt in
him. He was clad in a coat of thick metal rings, his head in a
glittering helmet, as large as a beer caldron, the left side of his
breast protected with extremely broad shield: the size of a barn
door. Thomas expected to see a sword, but the man had a heavy
spiked mace hanging on his right elbow instead. Across his saddle,
in no knightly way at all, he had a thick spear with head of plain
steel.</p>

<p>The rider pulled up. The travelers stopped in
five steps from him. The stranger’s eyes measured Thomas in an
open, impudent way. Thomas frowned, straightened up haughtily, his
hand moved to lower the visor, but he retained from it: he knew
that kind of jealous looks. <emphasis>Brigands attack for plunder, but
there is another sort of strange… yes, strange humans!</emphasis> In the
young Britain, that sort is called errant knights. They wander
along the roads of that land, still semi-wild, in search of the
fight itself, persist in it until they find a stronger knight and
even then try to get even with him. From bloody combats, they gain
nothing but wounds and injuries. Thomas had been one of them, and
remained one of them still but, whether influenced by Oleg or
unsettled by the recent meeting with forty wonderers, he spoke to
the stranger first, and spoke peacefully. “Greetings to you, sire!
May your road be short.”</p>

<p>The rider gave him a gloomy once-over and did
not stir, just bellowed in a deep voice that sounded like a roar of
angry bear. “Short? Are <emphasis>you</emphasis> the one who will shorten
it?”</p>

<p>“I may try. Why not?”</p>

<p>“Let’s see who is stronger,” the unknown
warrior agreed. “I’ve met none of my equals yet, but you look a
strong young oak… And I don’t recall you among champions. But work
is first, and fun second. Where do you wend your way from?”</p>

<p>Thomas noticed the rider glanced at Oleg with
evident unfriendliness, while Oleg watched him with sympathy and
some strange compassion.</p>

<p>Before the knight could flare up of the
stranger’s demanding question, Oleg replied in an even, placid
tone. “From Jerusalem. Bowed to the Holy Sepulcher, which the
crusaders won from Saracen last year, bathed in Jordan, been to
cypress groves… Now coming back home.”</p>

<p>“Through Tsargrad?”</p>

<p>“No other way available.”</p>

<p>“How is it there?” the rider demanded
menacingly.</p>

<p>Thomas frowned, put down his visor with a
thud. With a broad gesture, he slapped on his thigh where the sword
hilt was jutting up.</p>

<p>“Unrest,” Oleg replied peacefully.</p>

<p>“New nations attack?”</p>

<p>“Barbarians? They too, but now an Idol is
said to have appeared there. He and his have plundered some
churches, threw icons out, covered their horses with
chasubles…”</p>

<p>The rider went crimson and scarily huge. His
prominent eyes got bloodshot, he croaked in a fierce voice turning
a beastly roar. “How could you allow?”</p>

<p>Oleg moved his shoulder in vexation. Thomas
felt pleased for his friend, as he saw Oleg watching the giant
warrior with not a ghost of fear. “Has it been a long time,” Oleg
spoke with displeasure, “since we Ruses plundered Tsargrad? And now
we defend it?”</p>

<p>“Our Christian shrines are there!” the rider
bellowed.</p>

<p>“Not mine,” Oleg said in a dry voice. His
face darkened. “Not ours at all, you blockhead.”</p>

<p>Thomas interfered, fearing that the rider may
mistake the wonderer’s words for weakness or cowardice. “We don’t
care a damn of your right-cephalous shrines! I’m left-cephalic, and
my noble friend, though he walks on foot – a hero with his oddities
– professes the old faith of his forefathers, or maybe his
great-grandfathers…”</p>

<p>“Shut up, your iron thing!” the stranger
barked, without turning his big head to the gleaming knight. “And
you, wonderer! Aren’t you ashamed? I’ve met you once and heard more
of you. Twice as strong as me, but wandering by roads, careless as
a song bird that pecks dung! You lack boldness, and skill too. You
should have taken the vile Idol by paw – or what he has instead? –
and smash against the wall, for all the palace to shake, the domes
to drop from churches! A wet spot you’d leave of him, and there’d
be an end to it.”</p>

<p>Thomas puffed in rage, his sword half-bared.
He excited his horse with the bit, choosing a good position to
strike.</p>

<p>“Why should I matter a scuffle within a
foreign city?” Oleg replied in vexation. “Each month a new Idol
appears there. With his supporters! They call their leader a
prophet, and the leader of others – an Idol, and others do it the
way round, though I can barely tell them apart. Tsargrad is a
rotten city. If her people don’t mind who rules them, why should we
mind it?”</p>

<p>The hero goggled his eyes, his breath got
heavy. “How dare you… What do you say? Tsargrad is a holy city!
There’s the Patriarch of the Orthodox Church. That’s the place our
Russian faith comes from!”</p>

<p>Oleg’s face got darker again, he gnashed his
teeth. He looked as though he had a stabbing, bitter heartache. At
once, Thomas felt a savage hate for the stranger, drew his sword,
turned his stallion and made him back, to have a good running
start.</p>

<p>“Russian,” Oleg repeated in a flat voice. His
cheek gave a twitch, he stood as pallid as a dead man. “Your
Patriarch bows and scrapes before the Idol, the basileus, before
any prince who holds him in fist. Those left, Catholic believers
don’t bow, after all! They see faith as faith and power as power.
Fool you are! A fool of short memory… But is that your fault?”</p>

<p>The rider devoured him with fiery eyes. All
but fuming with grey smoke, he puffed up, grabbed his mace, but
made a great effort to restrain himself, only barked out with fury.
“Fool?! Don’t I remember that our holy Russian land has always kept
the faith of Christ? Our forefathers prayed to Christ and Saint
Nicholas! Filthy Pagan you are, the Hell’s fire will burn you!..
Take off your rags, now! And your basts too!”</p>

<p>Thomas bent forward in his saddle, cried at
the top of his voice, “Sir wonderer! Make way!.. And you, churl, do
fortify your spirit before I knock it out, to your foolish Orthodox
Christ who’s not a patch on our Catholic one!”</p>

<p>Oleg turned to him, as though stung, thrust
his hands over head. “Sir Thomas! Sir Thomas! Tame your righteous
fury. We’ll have a dispute of religion some other time, and now we
have a matter to settle!”</p>

<p>To the knight’s shock and indignation, Oleg
stripped off quickly: took off the rags of his cloak, with burs and
burdocks and frog spawn and green moss from the monsters’ backs
stuck to them, then his pants, even his worn-out boots, which the
nasty strongman had called basts.</p>

<p>Confused, Thomas twiddled his sword in hand,
his cheeks high-colored by bitter shame. He could not bear to see
his friend humiliated, so he resolved to ignore his insistent
request not to intrude. <emphasis>Come what may. If we die, we die
together. Not life matters but honor.</emphasis> But, suddenly, the
strongman got off his beast-like horse, threw his helmet down on
the road, undid and hurled down his heavy belt, gripped the hem of
the mail coat that reached his knees, pulled it over head with
effort, the entwined steel plates ringing.</p>

<p>The horse under Thomas danced nervously. The
knight’s jaw dropped as low as the sixth rivet on his armor. The
strongman had stripped off all his armor, even his red high boots
with silver tips on their turned-up toes!</p>

<p>In silence, with not a glance at each other,
Oleg and the strongman got into each other’s clothes. Thomas’s eyes
popped out again: the strongman’s mail was a real fit on the
wonderer, if not a bit tight in shoulders. High boots and helmet
were just the right size. Oleg twirled the giant mace like a
splinter of wood, hung it easily by strap on the saddle hook.</p>

<p>The strongman struggled into rags with open
disgust, sighed. “How many versts from hence to Tsargrad?” he asked
in a different voice.</p>

<p>“Fifty and over,” Oleg replied and jumped on
the black stallion. The horse moved his fiery eye, bared his teeth,
laid its ears back in a predatory way. Oleg clapped on his broad
forehead. “Hey, wolfish food, won’t you fell on the way?” he said
comfortingly, then turned to the strongman. “Hail to you, hero. I
believe you will overthrow the Idol… but is it what you should be
doing? Is <emphasis>that</emphasis> the Idol you must overthrow?”</p>

<p>“Thank you for your kind words,” the hero
muttered. “I can’t fathom you, for the life of me! It was <emphasis>on
your way</emphasis>! And I’m to do fifty versts and over, and ‘over’ can
make a hundred…” He wheeled round and, wasting no more words,
started his quick walk by the road to Constantinople. Thomas
followed him with puzzled eyes.</p>

<p>Long after, the knight drove his horse up to
Oleg who was waiting impatiently. Armored, he looked so strange for
Thomas’s eyes. “Sir wonderer, I feel a great secret here!”</p>

<p>“Great? There’s no secret at all, Sir
Thomas.” As Oleg rode side by side with Thomas, he towered over the
knight all but for a head. Thomas’s stallion looked a foal near the
giant black beast snorting in fury, looking at his neighbor asquint
with bloodshot eye, about to bite him.</p>

<p>“He said you are twice as strong…”</p>

<p>“He is Ilya Muromets<sup>18</sup>, a
great hero of the Russian land. Great not in strength, though his
might has no equals even among heroes, but great in his sacrifice.
He has no wife, no lover, no children, no parents – only Rus’!
Since he came to Kiev, as a mature man already, he defends and
protects only Rus’… as well as he can, surely. Rus’ is his love,
his passion, his life.”</p>

<p>“Hmmm… Is Kiev the Wild Field of yours?”</p>

<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>

<p>“He has a face of a man who slept in the open
air for many years, with his saddle as his pillow. Not the one used
to sitting and talking at the festive table.”</p>

<p>“You are right, Sir Thomas. Don’t be angry
with Ilya. He spends his life on a frontier post, as befits a hero.
Rus’ <emphasis>is</emphasis> big, though you still have trouble finding it
between the vast kingdoms of Poland and Bohemia. Muromets catches
enemies and offenders on their way. He’s burnt by summer sun, stung
by winter frosts, lashed by autumn rains. Everyone who crosses the
border unbidden is a foe to him!”</p>

<p>Thomas bowed his head slowly, as though
accepting the apologies for the rude man who simply could not
behave in a different way. “I see… But all the same, I’d not endure
such insults if I were you!”</p>

<p>Oleg, still strange and unusual to Thomas in
his armor, waved aside with great negligence. “I don’t take
insults, as I’ve told you. I felt ashamed to hide behind his back.
I’m not <emphasis>twice</emphasis> that strong, though he thinks I am… Could I
spend my life reading wise books in the silence of caves if no him
enduring frost, heat, and attacks of fierce enemies?”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back at the road. “Do you
think he’ll pass for a wonderer?” he doubted. “Too burly. And less
humble than nothing.”</p>

<p>“He only needs to get into the palace!” Oleg
took the mace off the saddle hook, twirled it, flung up into the
air deftly, not slowing the horse’s pace. The mace flew back with
din and terrible roar, its strap clapped loudly in the wind. Thomas
alerted and hunched up, trying to do it without being noticed.
<emphasis>This barbarian play is too dangerous.</emphasis> He glanced at Oleg
slantwise with fright. The wonderer rode on, looking straight
ahead. At some moment, his hand jerked forward – and the mace
smacked right into his palm. He tossed it up easily, caught by
handle, and hung on the saddle hook again. His stallion stepped
evenly, glanced a bit asquint on his rider absorbed in
brooding.</p>

<p>“Have you changed with Muromets to help him…
or you feel a trouble ahead?” Thomas asked suddenly.</p>

<p>“Both,” Oleg replied sadly. “Both of it, Sir
Thomas.” Without a stop, he trotted past the houses plastered to
the foot of the hill. They could see no livestock there save goats
and hens indeed.</p>

<p>Thomas nodded at the hamlet. “Will we turn
here?”</p>

<p>Oleg clapped absent-mindedly on his
stallion’s neck. “No, I’d rather go by shanks’ pony… by this
one.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 27</p>

<p>As the road was going north, well-groomed
fields were replaced by neglected, abandoned ones. Tall stone
towers were seen more and more often: lit by blazing torches at
night and bright reflected sunlight at daytime, as their guards
exchanged signals with the help of mirrors.</p>

<p>Soon they saw a plundered village and, beyond
it, the blackened ruins of the city that the wonderer had called
Zolochev. The city wall was destroyed in two places, tall stone
houses gaped with black holes of windows. Instead of roofs, they
had white fresh-squared beams. Joined with cross-beams, they
resembled picked skeletons of those monsters Thomas would hardly be
able to forget until his death hour. Men bustled about. They
whipped the survived horses, dragged logs and bricks, in some
ant-like hurry to build their hill again.</p>

<p>“They also at war,” Oleg said sadly. “Forays,
mutinies… Well, we ride farther to Saltov and part there. I’ll turn
northeast, and you? Will you go back by the same road you took for
Jerusalem?”</p>

<p>“I don’t remember it,” Thomas confessed.
“Would noble knights who went to free the Holy Sepulcher bother
with maps? We asked peasants and passers-by, and they pointed in
the side where Jerusalem lies. That was how we went.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I see! You went with no calculations,
not for plunder, but at the call of your heart. That’s why you made
such a mess of things!”</p>

<p>“Which things?”</p>

<p>“Er… bones. In two days, after we pass
Saltov, I shall turn onto the road across Steppes. And now the only
way is straight.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer… It’s amazing but I’ve never
had such a noble and worthy companion in my journey before! I have
no brother, but when I come back to Britain, I’ll say I have!”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Oleg replied awkwardly. He knew
what it cost a noble knight to make such a confession to a common
man. “Thank you, Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>The nights were warm and so starry that the
travelers had no need to make fire. However, twice they did it to
dry their clothes after they got caught in a short bitter
shower.</p>

<p>In one day’s ride before Saltov, they stopped
for night in a beautiful cypress grove. Their horses stayed with
them. The place looked like a wonderful garden, with well-groomed
apple, pear, peach, and pomegranate trees in the middle of it. Oleg
pointed at a heap of colossal stones and explained that some dozen
years before there used to be a luxurious summer palace of a high
lord, with a rich orchard and flower garden. Once there had been
music and songs and children playing, but one could hardly survive
that bloody time if he stayed far from thick city walls and their
brutal garrisons.</p>

<p>Thomas insisted on his standing the night
watch, as he was a man of battle and soldier’s duty, while sir
wonderer was a private man and priest: though a great hero, but all
the same a member of the respectable estate that needs protection.
So he should sleep by the fire, while Thomas, a hero who stormed
the Tower of David, would guard and feast his eyes on stars. Each
the size a fist, unlike the stars in his homeland: no larger than
snowflakes frozen on the pale northern sky!</p>

<p>Oleg went to sleep, laughing silently. The
hardest time to stay awake is before dawn, and he was going to
change the selfless knight then. <emphasis>And now let him watch the
southern sky. He will hardly get out of his northern Land of White
Wolves again soon… Or his Tin Isles… Britain… Saxon Anglia…</emphasis></p>

<p>As Thomas sat by the fire, he sometimes
tossed dry branches in it. With love and care, he moved the
whetstone by the steel edge of the sword he had on his knees,
fingered it from the sharp point to the cross-shaped handle. Fitted
into the base of the hilt by the skilled armorer (who had also
fixed Thomas’s breastplate and shoed his horse), there was the
nail: red with Savior’s blood, its head flattened. The nail was
crooked but wonder-working: every time Thomas thought of it, he
felt a tremble in his body, then a burst of energy.</p>

<p>Slowly, he struck the rough stone along the
sharp edge. His long sword could cut the iron handle of a mace or
cleave a steel helmet, but the curved Saracen sabers he had
encountered on the East could cut a pillow in two halves! A good
Saracen saber was obliged to slash a light veil and a woman’s
thinnest hair. To his shame, Thomas felt more and more love for the
elegant Saracen weapons. His English sword seemed rough as a hammer
in comparison with those.</p>

<p>He moved the whetstone carefully, brought the
blade closer to fire to take a good look at it. There was a rustle.
In a flash, Thomas recoiled from the fire, gripped the sword hilt,
but his eyes were blinded by the blazing fire, bright sparkles
floated before them in the dark. Tardily, he recalled the wonderer
had never sat his vigil face to fire.</p>

<p>Someone struck his head, like an anvil, from
behind. Hot fires blazed up in his eyes. Thomas rose, brandished
his sword, but a heavy creature jumped on his back, struck again,
and Thomas lapsed into the dark.</p>

<p>Through the pounding of blood in his ears, he
heard voices. The dark sky dome with big stars was the same, the
fire had burnt down a bit, crackling with coals. Dark figures
emerged and vanished in the red semi-dark, iron clanged, shrubs
snapped. He could see no horses but heard them snorting.</p>

<p>A gloomy face emerged from the dark to hang
over Thomas, a broad face with prominent cheekbones. The man’s
eyes, gleaming with excitement, examined his captive quickly. His
lips moved apart, baring yellow dented teeth. “This safe… The other
cost three ours, but we made it… D’you think we were paid
fair?”</p>

<p>He was answered by a strange guttural voice
from the dark. “First I thought we were overpaid! But now I’m not
sure.”</p>

<p>“But we <emphasis>got</emphasis> them!”</p>

<p>“Sleepy. What if they woke on time?”</p>

<p>The man stepped away from Thomas. “It’s done,
anyway. But you’re right: we could demand more. Though they warned
us… I’ve never seen such men before!”</p>

<p>Thomas stirred, checking the ropes. A sharp
pain flared up in the back of his head, hammers went knocking in
his temples. His hands were tied up with a thick rope tightly,
neither could he move his feet. He heard a groan nearby, turned his
head. A wish to die of shame filled him: the wonderer lay in three
steps, naked to the waist, his blooded face pressed against the
ground, his hands tied up on his back with several coils of a thick
rope, as well as his feet. In the reddish firelight, his muscle
seemed carved of dark wood.</p>

<p>A squat man emerged from darkness, his face
oddly flat and yellow. He limped, his strong hands dangled on a
level with knees. In his crooked fingers, which looked like roots
of an old tree, he had clanging chains and iron bangles. With no
word, only a crunch of joints, he sank beside Thomas, put the iron
on his ankles and wrists, started riveting it. Thomas swore: that
fool, blind in the dark, missed straight off and hammered his
ankle. His leg was completely numb, swollen with the rope, but the
dull ache in the bone echoed over his whole body.</p>

<p>The wonderer moaned, turned on his side.
Thomas saw his face and closed his eyes tight at once, though he
knew he’d see it branded on the inner side of his eyelids: the
maimed, blooded face of his friend whom Thomas’s mistake betrayed
into the hands of foes!</p>

<p>“Kite, send for master!” a husky voice said
in the dark. “He pays rest, and we ride away. I don’t like it
here.”</p>

<p>A hoarse laughter and malicious voice came
from another side. “Stelmah has already run for him!.. He’s in a
hurry. For good news, he’ll get two extra gold coins.”</p>

<p>“Damn him… We have no choice. Two of ours
killed by that beast, though already tied up, one strangled by iron
devil… A bit more – and they’d have killed all of us!”</p>

<p><emphasis>I strangled him</emphasis>, Thomas grasped.
<emphasis>But when?</emphasis> As far as he recalled, the dark came at once. In
his fall, he must have reached the enemy, pressed him down, and
squeezed. Strangely, he still had armor on, while the wonderer was
stripped off it. <emphasis>He’s had the armor of Muromets on for barely an
hour. He’s just not fated to wear armor!</emphasis></p>

<p>In the silent night, the trample of hooves
rang out, approaching. Someone came rushing at full tilt. His horse
neighed in fright when its bit was seized suddenly from the
dark.</p>

<p>A complaisant hand tossed some dry twigs into
the fire. It crackled, lit the small glade up. Thomas heard steps,
then a hoarse voice constrained with rage and burning passion.
“They!.. At last!”</p>

<p>A knight in light armor stood over Thomas,
his legs wide apart. He was clad in mail, leather pants, and light
boots, only his helmet was a heavy, knightly one: it covered all of
his face, with only a narrow slit for eyes and tiny holes drilled
in the metal on a level with mouth.</p>

<p>Thomas shuddered. Cold came into his limbs,
filled them with lead. He peered into the narrow slit in fear,
trying to see the eyes.</p>

<p>The other knight bent forward, shook his
head. His voice was hoarse, scary. “You know me, Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>“Sir Gorvel?” Thomas whispered. His voice
broke, a tight lump blocked his throat.</p>

<p>The knight took his helmet with both hands,
lifted it slowly. Thomas gave a cry and bit his lip, as he saw that
corpse face: maimed and yellow, ugly scars coming down over each
another. Thomas could see red gums and a row of teeth through the
narrow hole in Gorvel’s left cheek. A white dry bone protruded from
his trimmed right cheek. <emphasis>As though on a skeleton after crows had
their feast upon it.</emphasis> His right socket, empty and crimson like
the pharynx of the Hell’s stove, did not outstand much anymore on
his fully disfigured face.</p>

<p>With effort, Gorvel stretched his lips, as
white as worms, in a malevolent smile. “You know… And I see, you
grasped what awaits you this time… before I cut off your head and
fling it into a pot of boiling water!”</p>

<p>“Why?” Thomas whispered in a choking
voice.</p>

<p>Gorvel put his helmet on slowly, in jerks, as
though his sinews were damaged. His voice was muffled, but still
full of towering malice. “To separate meat. I’ll make a spittoon of
your skull!”</p>

<p>“Once you were civilized…” Thomas whispered.
“Sir Gorvel, don’t flatter yourself. It was no fear that make me
shudder. It was pity!”</p>

<p>With no word, Gorvel kicked Thomas’s face
with his boot. Thomas spat out a clot of blood, which hung by the
soft top of foe’s boot. Gorvel kicked him again, targeting his
smashed lips, but hit on the cheekbone. Blood went running down in
an oblique trickle.</p>

<p>“To barn,” Gorvel commanded. His voice was as
shaky as epileptic’s. “There’s a good one made of logs, beyond the
orchard. I’ll be back in a couple of hours and kill them. But first
I want to make sure the cup in his bag is that one!”</p>

<p>The flat-faced man who was called Kite
objected with heat, “To barn? It’s beyond us to keep them there for
two hours, even tied up. The two of them will smash every barn,
should it be from the biggest stones, not to mention logs. It’s not
what we agreed on! They need to be watched even if tied, even if
chained! Watched each by ten men. And even then…”</p>

<p>Gorvel wheeled round abruptly, his only eye
blazed fiercely through the narrow slit. For a minute they watched
each other without taking their eyes off, then Gorvel said, “You
are right, rascal! I forgot how they escaped last time, how many
men killed… Get them on horses, take to the waterfall. We’ll behead
them there and hurl their bodies to fish. And now I shall take the
cup to the master.”</p>

<p>Two men yanked Thomas up roughly, took the
rope off his feet and looped it around his neck before making him
sit ahorse. The other end of the rope was looped around Oleg’s
neck: the wonderer was put on another horse. If Thomas fell down,
the horse would drag him and strangle quickly, and Oleg would also
be dragged off and strangled. Thomas grew cold. “Don’t you see the
cup is the same?” he asked hastily.</p>

<p>Gorvel jerked his head. His voice was
spiteful. “Do you think I looked into the bag last time? I’m not
superstitious, but progressists avoid unnecessary risk. Let others
check whether it can do any harm or not.”</p>

<p>Kite and another hireling helped Gorvel up
into the saddle. Fiercely, Gorvel raised the horse to its hind
legs, as though taking a revenge for his visible weakness caused by
severe injury, yelled, and both vanished in the dark, with only an
abrupt clatter of hooves.</p>

<p>“Peter, Paul,” Kite called harshly, “let’s
go! Keep an eye on them. I don’t trust them even with loops on
their necks.”</p>

<p>The two hirelings named by Kite got their
horses going. The small caravan dragged itself through the night
slowly. Kite would ride ahead to see the way, come back hastily,
check the ropes on the hands of captives, touch the horsehair loops
on their necks.</p>

<p>They turned left off the road and rode for a
long time. Finally, Kite reined up. Thomas saw a predatory glitter
of his eyes in the moonlight. “There! Look at the wide world, you
knight!”</p>

<p>“Is it white?” Thomas asked arrogantly. “You
must be blind, fool. It’s the black of night.”</p>

<p>Kite’s smile went broader. “I love brave
men.”</p>

<p>They stood near the dark wall of the forest.
A dull roar of waterfall was heard aside, a blow of cold coming
from there. In the silvery moonlight, there was a vague outline of
the rocky steep with a cloud of water spray over it.</p>

<p>The captives were dragged off the horses.
Oleg still looked stunned. Thomas took in the place with a
desperate glance, noticed a luxuriant oak grove, of old oaks with
spreading branches, a birch forest on the left, and a thick hazel
grove on the other side of the glade. As Thomas’s eyes got
accustomed to the moonlight, he discerned ripe hazel nuts. For some
strange reason, that was the bitterest stitch at his heart. <emphasis>I’ll
never crack nuts again and those villains, that human filth, will
have more of the juicy kernels!</emphasis></p>

<p>“Here’s the end of your life,” Kite
explained. “A beautiful place. Even a waterfall, which is rare in
this land!.. Pity you are no Pagan. Christians don’t mind such
things, but Pagans like to die in beautiful places and beautiful
poses. First we’ll cut off your heads, yours and you wild friend’s,
then hurl them to fish. Should some piece be thrown ashore, it
would be smaller than a little finger!”</p>

<p>“The master might see it in a different way,”
another hireling, Paul, warned him.</p>

<p>Peter, the third one, burst with stupid
laughter. Kite shook his head with regret. “They must have been a
real plague… Were it you to scratch him?.. Well, never mind.” He
shoved Thomas. The knight fell on his back and tied hands, numb
fingers crunched painfully.</p>

<p>At once, Peter was over the knight, his saber
bare, but his voice comforting. “We’d have finished you straight
off, but the order is different. Don’t be afraid. We’ll kill you,
but with no torture.”</p>

<p>Thomas sat up with effort. “I don’t blame
you,” he said haughtily. “You are common villains. But no excuse
for Sir Gorvel for mixing with you. He is a noble man, after
all!”</p>

<p>Kite exchanged glances with his hirelings and
laughed. “Noble man? We are innocent lambs before your Sir Gorvel!
When he crosses a desert, snakes creep away in fear of his venom,
vultures flee and jackals run: they have nothing to do where Gorvel
comes! Did you see him different? Though I doubt whether he could
be different… Well, knight, have your rest.”</p>

<p>Thomas leaned his back against a big boulder.
“Thank you,” he replied arrogantly. “The Holy Virgin in her mercy
created this stone beforehand, for me to sit with comfort.”</p>

<p>“Excellent! And you, foreign pilgrim, sit
next to him,” Kite suggested merrily.</p>

<p>Oleg rested his back against a granite rock
in three steps away. It was all prominent stones and juts. His head
drooped helplessly on his chest, blood dripped slowly on his knees.
As he heard Kite, he tossed his head, looked with lackluster eyes.
“Thank you. I have more comfort here.”</p>

<p>“Which comfort?” Kite asked suspiciously.</p>

<p>“Don’t you see? I was up for two nights, and
it keeps me awake now. If these are my last minutes, I’d like to
see the world. Sir knight knows I am Pagan.”</p>

<p>Kite looked at Peter with inquiry. The
hireling nodded. “He had no cross on!”</p>

<p>Kite waved his hand uncaringly. “No breath is
enough before death… Well, stay where you like. Hey, Peter, Paul!
Keep your eyes on them! Is it clear?”</p>

<p>“As clear as it can,” Peter grumbled. “We
keep our <emphasis>hands</emphasis> on them.”</p>

<p>Both sat before Thomas, their swords on their
knees. In times they glanced at Oleg who was all but behind them,
but the barbarian looked completely exhausted, covered with blood,
and the rope on his hands, which were behind him, would do to keep
an elephant. Besides, Kite had recalled the three killed men and
ordered to tie the barbarian’s feet up tighter.</p>

<p>Thomas sat, resting against the boulder, his
back straightened up: he did not want them to think he’d lost heart
before death. His eyes looked arrogantly over the heads of
hirelings. “Kite, this iron bone is too calm,” Paul said nervously
at last. “His even snuffs burn holes in my stomach! Let’s finish
them off and throw into waterfall.”</p>

<p>“And the master?”</p>

<p>“Tell him truth. Or you think he won’t pay us
then?”</p>

<p>“He’ll claim we allowed them to slip out. He
seems to have been scared in no small way before.”</p>

<p>Paul squatted down before Thomas, waved the
end of his saber before the eyes of the arrogant knight. “Stop
grinning!”</p>

<p>“Stop trembling, you!” Kite told him harshly,
with contempt. “He’s a noble knight. Blue blood! Has cold feet, but
keeps his arrogance. It’s their noble way. You are a fool to take
it at face value.”</p>

<p>Paul squirmed, glanced at Kite with
suspicion. “Why to feign?”</p>

<p>“Dunno,” Kite replied with a venomous smile,
“it’s the way of nobles. But if you quake with fear still, then
watch them closely. And you, Peter!”</p>

<p>“I’m watching,” Peter assured gloomily. “I
saw how this iron bone snatched Nitwit. Squeezed once, and no whole
bone left! And his heart slid out through his throat…”</p>

<p>Kite and Paul exchanged nervous glances, then
glared at Thomas.</p>

<p><emphasis>Well done me</emphasis>, Thomas thought. <emphasis>Lost
consciousness, but kept my knightly grip. Pity I can recall none of
it.</emphasis></p>

<p>Kite was sitting before him. Black eyes
glittered on his flat face, as they reflected the cold stars. He
kept his saber in hand. In times, he would touch the sharp point
with the nail of his thumb, as Thomas had done not so long
before.</p>

<p>Shame drove hot blood to the knight’s face
again. He uttered a muffled groan, made himself toss his head
arrogantly and look over the heads of contemptible hirelings. The
wonderer sat in three or four steps behind Kite and Paul, his face
miserable, in dark stripes of dry blood. He moved his shoulders a
bit closer, raised himself with effort, started to squirm
nervously, as though scratching his back against the rock. Thomas
watched him with perplexity: the wonderer seemed no coward, he’d
proved his boldness more than once, but he was evidently nervous
now, wriggling with fear – no warrior, after all, just a very
strong man who had a good luck…</p>

<p>Suddenly Thomas felt a new wave of hot blood
rush up to his cheeks. He winked with shame, all but cried. Shame
on the noble knight who thought of the courageous pilgrim in the
way he did! Oleg must have chosen that bad place just because he
resolved at once to try to fray through the rope on his hands!</p>

<p>“You are all cowards,” Thomas spoke as
mysteriously as he could. “I still have a chance to destroy
you.”</p>

<p>Kite’s fingers took a firmer grip on the
saber hilt. Peter and Paul rushed to feel the rope on his feet at
once, and the collision of their heads lit the night with sparks.
“Which chance?” Kite demanded.</p>

<p>“You will know,” Thomas told him slowly,
keeping eyes on him, then looked at his tied feet. The three
hirelings stared there too.</p>

<p>Paul went pale. Peter recoiled. Kite gritted
his teeth, slapped Thomas on his face with all his might. “Now?..
You may scare these fools, but I’m a different sort!”</p>

<p>“Are you?” Thomas doubted. His smashed lips
bled, but he got their eyes fixed on him. None of the three could
see the desperate efforts of the wonderer. Oleg looked sullen and
dulled, his face mostly hid in the shade, but something about him
made Thomas hope.</p>

<p>The wonderer squirmed up and down, as though
taking very deep breath. Thomas stiffened, bit his lip in fear and
felt the salty taste of blood: a dark stripe came out from behind
the wonderer’s back and went down slowly. It was a bit darker than
the rocks and dry ground. Thomas could see it only because he was
peering intently.</p>

<p>Thomas’s heart ached with fear and pity: the
wonderer had cut his hands severely against the stone ledge, trying
to fray the rope through. The pool of blood was growing, spreading
around, as though he had cut large blood vessels!</p>

<p>For a moment, Thomas thought the wonderer
decided to take his own life, not to let the despicable killers
take it. But he was no noble man – a Pagan barbarian, and that sort
would struggle for life till their last sigh, the last drop of
blood and even longer. <emphasis>When Devil drags their souls to Hell,
they must be biting him as fiercely as they can…</emphasis></p>

<p>“I know what I say,” Thomas told them
significantly. He raised his voice, to prevent them from taking
eyes off him. “Do you think I learnt nothing? On all the long way
from my northern land over two seas to the torrid Jerusalem? When I
took the Tower of David from infidels by storm? When I climbed the
tall walls of Jerusalem?.. And the sudden attacks of Saracen riders
on their horses, as fast as the simoom of deserts! And their
assassins! You are no more than blind kittens against them!”</p>

<p>In a loud voice, he began to tell stories of
the triumphant campaign of Christ’s host. The hirelings listened,
their eyes fixed on him. Professional killers, they had thus never
been outside their country, saw neither hotter nor colder lands,
nor even the sea. <emphasis>Too busy to travel. Restless times give more
work to killers than to farmers or carpenters.</emphasis></p>

<p>Suddenly Paul, the most suspicious one of the
three, stirred anxiously. “It seems to me he chatters on some
purpose!” His voice gave a quaver.</p>

<p>Peter laughed with light heart. “Of course he
does! It helps him not to think of what awaits him.”</p>

<p>“No. There’s something maturing in his
dome…”</p>

<p>“Soon the dome breaks and you see all of it,”
Peter comforted. “Come on, iron bone! Come on!”</p>

<p>Thomas opened his mouth, but there came a
trample of horse hooves in the dark. Kite took his bow and arrows,
Peter and Paul – their sabers, the three of them stretched their
necks to look over Thomas’s head. At last, Kite said with relief,
“The master’s horse!.. Well, knight, the time’s coming.”</p>

<p>A rider became visible against the starry
sky, his head and shoulders a strange gleam in the moonlight, as if
he were covered with hoarfrost. His horse snorted, as it heard
other horses, gave a soft neigh. Kite rushed to meet Gorvel with
servility, helped him to dismount. Then one more rider emerged, on
a small shaggy horse. Thomas grasped it was Stelmah.</p>

<p>Gorvel hobbled quickly up to the place where
Thomas sat in his ties, shot a brief glance, through the narrow
slit, at the motionless wonderer who seemed unconscious, his head
dropped on the blooded chest, and turned again to the gleaming
knight at once. “All in place?.. I rushed like a genie! Got afraid
that some filth will interfere and spoil all of it. That’s no
knight but a devil himself!”</p>

<p>“We coped with devils too,” Kite assured.</p>

<p>Gorvel limped up, stopped before Thomas. His
only eye glittered in the moonlight through the slit, like a piece
of ice. Thomas could see clearly a red socket in place of another
eye. <emphasis>It looks like the Hell’s stove where this man is doomed to
be burning forever.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas replied with a straight look that
showed his unsullied knightly pride, arrogance, and noble
haughtiness. Gorvel spoke slowly, his breath still fast after a mad
gallop. “What would you say now, Sir Thomas?”</p>

<p>“That I shall ride on and you stay here,”
Thomas replied in a voice of a noble-born speaking to a
stableman.</p>

<p>Gorvel recoiled, his hand gripped the sword.
He glanced back at Kite and his companions with suspicion.</p>

<p>Kite advanced his palms, protesting. “It’s
all right! Knights are all thick-headed. He can be brought to
reason only by spear in his heart. Or his brain splashed around by
battleax.”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll bring him to reason!” Gorvel said
in a dull voice. “Or splash around?”</p>

<p>He drew out his sword: not knightly, as
Thomas spotted, but a short and light one, as his maimed hand was
no longer able to hold his previous heavy sword. Unwinking, Thomas
looked at the steel mask that hung over him. The pity he felt for
the half-man disappeared. The look of his blue eyes that seemed
dark in the moonlight was straight and clear as always.</p>

<p>Gorvel’s voice thrashed in the iron box of
his helmet, like a scary bat seeking a way out, darting from one
side to another, scratching the iron with sharp claws. “You are the
hero of the storm of the Tower of David, you released the Holy
Sepulcher!.. You know prayers. You have to. Though I never heard
you saying any but the name of Our Lady or swearing with clerical
words. But now I want to hear a true prayer of you!”</p>

<p>“A true prayer will plunge you deeper into
the Hell,” Thomas replied. “Don’t you fear a retribution from
God?”</p>

<p>“We will all burn in Hell,” Gorvel snapped.
“Not only me.”</p>

<p>Thomas saw in the dark that the rope on the
wonderer’s body suddenly got weak. It had been stretched so tightly
that it burst with a terrible crash, a crack like the one made by a
shepherd’s whip. Everyone should have turned there, rush to him
with sabers. Thomas’s heart got bleeding, but all the five of them,
including Stelmah (he had come closer), were peering intently in
the knight’s furious face. Thomas realized they heard no noises but
the roar of close waterfall and the heavy breath of Gorvel.</p>

<p>“I’ll say more,” Gorvel’s voice roared in the
steel tower of his helmet. “You will live just as long as your
prayer lasts! But pray loudly, for us to hear every word.”</p>

<p>Behind them, the wonderer lifted his hands
slowly. The fragments of ropes were still on them, dark blood
dripped on the ground. His face was twisted with pain, his eyes two
dark holes.</p>

<p>“Do it!” Gorvel demanded fiercely. He pressed
the sword hilt a bit, the blade cut the skin on Thomas’s throat.
Thomas felt a hot thin trickle running down. Strangely, it brought
him relief. <emphasis>The wonderer is not the only one bleeding.</emphasis></p>

<p>“That’s a knight!” Kite said in vexation.
“Proud. No prayer of him.”</p>

<p>“Why not? We’ll have it,” Gorvel assured.
“But I suspect he, though swearing with the name of Holy Virgin at
every step, knows no prayers at all.”</p>

<p>Paul made a wary move closer to them, his
eyes fixed on the dark stripe of blood on the knight’s throat.
“Getting to prayer now for him is the same as begging mercy,” he
supposed. “These are Franks. They only pray to their god because he
doesn’t exist really – no one ever saw him!”</p>

<p>Behind them, the wonderer stooped, his numb
fingers undid the tight knots on his feet. Slowly, he got up,
reeled on his stiffened legs.</p>

<p>Gorvel and Kite kept their eyes on the pallid
knight’s throat. At last, Gorvel brought his sword away. His
fingers took a stronger grip on the hilt, his voice from the iron
cage sounded full of violent rage. “Then go to your stupid
paradise, you miserable! And I’ll stay on earth. I swear I will
steal Krizhina, the girl who you dreamed of even before the storm
of the Tower of David. I shall be laughing at you, while I and
she…”</p>

<p>“False comfort,” Thomas interrupted proudly.
“She will never want even to wipe her feet on you.”</p>

<p>Gorvel raised the glittering blade of his
sword overhead. He took a deep breath, engraving in his memory the
sweet moment of the last blow that would break his foe’s head
apart, like a rotten nut shell, splash his brain within dozens of
steps around…</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 28</p>

<p>The wonderer rushed to them with his arms
outstretched, grabbed as many villains as he could, hit them
against each other. Only Kite and Stelmah escaped him: the beastly
intuition of Kite made him jump aside at the very last moment, and
Stelmah was standing aside.</p>

<p>There were shrieks. Gorvel wheezed, as the
bodies of Peter and Paul pressed him down. The wonderer rose from
the top of the heap of bodies. At once, Kite jumped from behind,
stabbed Oleg on his back, while Stelmah rolled into the shrubs,
jumped up there, seized his bow with both hands.</p>

<p>A strong fist hit Kite’s face with a crunch,
as though a heavy stone fell on a nest of eggs. Silently, Kite
vanished in the night. Oleg seized Thomas by chained hands,
shouldered him with effort. As Kite fell, a dagger slipped off his
hand, Thomas caught it involuntarily in the air, then his belly hit
against something solid, the grey ground went rushing before his
eyes, sliding away swiftly. He grasped he lay on the shoulder of
the wounded Oleg running into the night. Thomas heard a swish
nearby, then a scary dull smack, and again, but got no meaning of
it, dangling on the running wonderer’s shoulder, like a sack of
sand, his chained arms and legs ringing.</p>

<p>There was a furious shout behind. The
wonderer crashed into dark hazel shrubs, turned abruptly, ran down
a crack, turned again. Twigs scratched Thomas’s face painfully, he
heard yells, shrieks, snapping of branches behind. Soon that was
joined by abrupt clatter of hooves. Gorvel’s voice came from the
left, and Stelmah replied from the right. He was chasing ahorse:
felt the way or had the best eyesight to find in the dark the way
among trees and thick bushes.</p>

<p>The wonderer stopped. Through his heavy
rattling breath, Thomas heard the shouts of pursuers, shrill and
shrieking. Gorvel, evidently with his iron helmet off, bellowed,
promised any sum of money, any treasures to the one who comes up
with runaways and kills them. Frightened Stelmah screamed back they
should have done it straight away, with none of that noble clowning
that cost them three men with broken backs and then Kite with
smashed skull…</p>

<p>“Leave me, sir wonderer,” Thomas said
hoarsely.</p>

<p>The wonderer ran again, jumping over logs,
slipping on smooth stones covered with night dew, climbing over
rocky heaps. Thomas on his shoulder heard Stelmah crying they were
just about to come upon, as the knight’s hands and feet were
fettered by indestructible iron and his foolish servant shed the
ground with blood as he ran, with not only a wound of Kite’s dagger
on his back but also two arrows in it.</p>

<p>Thomas turned his head in terror. Before his
very eyes, in the moonlight, some light feathers bristled angrily
at the wind. <emphasis>Feathers of two arrows in Oleg’s back!</emphasis> Thomas
heard the wonderer’s breath bursting out with heavy screaming,
moaned helplessly. <emphasis>A giant! No, a titan. Even a giant would have
fallen already.</emphasis></p>

<p>“Leave me,” Thomas whispered angrily, “or
we’ll die both! Heal you wounds, then return and kill them!”</p>

<p>The wonderer’s breath burst from his chest,
roaring like a forest fire. Being jerked up with each his
convulsive sigh, Thomas cursed own weight, in a fervent desire to
become as small and light as the warrior monks of that southern
monastery.</p>

<p>The wonderer broke into some new shrubs,
darted across a moonlit open space, turned, rushed again, like an
elk, across a big glade, trampling on white caps of mushrooms.
Suddenly it got pitch-dark around: the thick tree branches screened
off the starry sky and the shiny disk of the moon.</p>

<p>The wonderer reeled, fell down to his knees.
Thomas slipped off his shoulder, fell on the stones. The trample
was dying away. Next to him, the wonderer breathed in scary
rattles. A narrow moon ray fell on his raised dead face. His lips
were blue, his palms leaned against the rocky wall. Two thick
arrows stuck out almost in the middle of his back, under shoulder
blades. The wonderer’s rattling was going quieter, his head coming
down in jerks.</p>

<p>In two steps, there was a tinkle of water.
Thomas got up to his knees, crawled there, scooped the water with
fettered hands – the thick bangles and the chain prevented cupping
them – and brought it to Oleg, half of it spilled on his short and
hard way. The wonderer had slipped off the boulder, fell down
prone. Thomas spilled the last drops on the wonderer’s neck,
gritted his teeth in silent despair: his friend was dying before
his very eyes!</p>

<p>With effort, he broke the arrows, leaving
their ends stuck in the back, turned the wonderer on his side. Oleg
rattled, his eyes rolled up, his face cramped, then his chest
stiffened and raised scarily. Sinews in his thick neck bulged in a
frightful way, about to tear. His body flinched, then started to
relax.</p>

<p>Weeping and not ashamed of tears, Thomas
jumped to the stream on his fettered feet, brought a handful of
water, wrenched his palms. The drops fell into Oleg’s open mouth.
His pale lips twitched, jaws came together slowly, with a creepy
grind of teeth. Then his Adam’s apple jerked up, with great effort,
as if the wonderer bit off and swallowed a piece of hard air.</p>

<p>Shedding tears, Thomas brought water once
more, poured it into Oleg’s mouth. The water all but hissed as it
fell into his hot throat, a small cloud of steam flew up. The
wonderer gulped down, his overstretched sinews, almost at a point
of breaking, started to sink slowly, to subside under his dead
skin. His face, distorted by a cramp, remained scary. His lips
moved, Thomas heard a croak. “Where… they?”</p>

<p>“Alive,” Thomas whispered, hearing the songs
of Heaven’s angels. “Hold on, don’t die… I saw men who didn’t die
of an arrow. Even of two…” He said nothing about the wound of
dagger: blood still trickling out of it, while falling in rare
heavy drops from under the arrows.</p>

<p>“Alive still…” the wonderer croaked a bit
quieter. “Off chance we keep…”</p>

<p>“Off chance, off chance,” Thomas agreed
hastily. “I’ll crawl away, and you hide. If they find me, keep
silent. Probably even Pagan gods will do to save your life. I
adjure you: if you survive, take the Holy Grail to my England. But
not old England, the one on the continent – to the new one on
isles!”</p>

<p>“The Land of White Wolves…”</p>

<p>“Britain,” Thomas corrected. “There you’ll
become a honorable… Probably, you’ll even get a noble rank. Though
not knight’s…”</p>

<p>There were shouts far away. Judging by the
voices, the grove was combed by a long human chain. Thomas shook
his fettered hands angrily, tugged the iron off his feet The wide
bangles dug into bare flesh, the scratches went bleeding. “We’re
caught!” he hissed in despair. “Now they don’t bustle about like
angry dogs who lost hare’s tracks!”</p>

<p>The wonderer got up to his knees with a moan,
his face twisted with pain. The tendons in his neck bulged,
threatening to break the skin.</p>

<p>“You way is down the stream,” Thomas said
hastily. “A steep wall there, but with a pass made by waterfall!
They won’t hear you in its roar.”</p>

<p>He sounded hopeless: the wonderer was dying,
and getting down a steep wall was a difficult thing indeed, even
for a strong, healthy highlander… at daytime, not in the moonlight
when one can’t see own hands. And then he would have to force the
roaring torrent of icy water that jumps, like an animal, over
rocks, carries dead trunks, dead animals, drags huge boulders!</p>

<p>The wonderer struggled up to his feet,
lurched. His voice was broken with pain. “Yes… Here they can find
us…”</p>

<p>He stepped past Thomas. A huge hand, which
seemed to come down from the starry sky, seized the knight roughly
by belt. Flying up into the air, he cried, his body hit against a
hard surface, which gave a swing. The stones in the wall went
floating past Thomas. Finally, he realized lying not on rock but on
the wonderer’s shoulder. “Mad man,” Thomas cried in a whisper, “you
won’t climb down!”</p>

<p>Oleg’s breath went faster, more backbreaking.
Thomas tried to relax, lest he bounce that high on the hard hot
shoulder. The wonderer kept picking up speed, in a hurry to leave
the moonlit space behind.</p>

<p>The roar of the waterfall grew louder, more
menacing. On the edge of the rocky steep, the wonderer dropped to
his knees, Thomas slipped silently on the ground. His head banged
against a stone, he gritted his teeth, lacking his steel helmet.
The incessant roar and thunder, a blow of cold and cloaking water
spray were coming from below.</p>

<p>The wonderer crawled over the edge, hung on
his hands, raised a bit as he found a foothold, reached for Thomas.
The knight tried to move away but the strong hand shouldered him,
and Thomas froze, like a worm in cocoon, in fear that a careless
move would push both himself and Oleg off into the abyss.</p>

<p>The moon came out from behind a tiny cloud,
the night grew lighter. Thomas shot a glance down and all but
wrenched out with fear. The wonderer climbs down a steep wall, like
a fly, finding by miracle the smallest ledges and cracks to set
feet and hands. Thomas hangs, looking into the abyss, at the height
of a ten-floored palace. Far below, a mighty water stream rushes
among sharp stones, spits foam, drags huge boulders with a thunder,
their smooth gleaming backs stick out, polished by the water. If he
falls, he’ll crumble to pieces with fear before he gets down!</p>

<p>The wonderer’s breath was backbreaking, blood
streamed down his back. Evidently, he was holding with his last
strength, his fingers about to weaken, to come off the even rocky
wall, and the two of them to start a long fall, as long as their
lives!</p>

<p>Carefully, Thomas tried to slip off Oleg’s
shoulder: he resolved to fall alone and let his brave friend
survive. <emphasis>If the Virgin lets it too.</emphasis> He got afraid, but the
more terror crept into his soul, the more diligence he put into his
moves off the steep shoulder, seeking a way to slip down that would
spare the wonderer.</p>

<p>Suddenly he felt the wonderer’s arm, up to
the shoulder, passing under his chain. <emphasis>Now we’ll fall both!</emphasis>
So Thomas, gnawing his teeth and cursing the selflessness of the
northern barbarian of Scythia, tried to move his body closer to his
neck to distribute the weight among both shoulders. “Angels damn
you,” he hissed, like an angry snake, in Oleg’s ear, “and your
nobility! We knights can die with no cry…”</p>

<p>The wonderer started to groan hoarsely
through gritted teeth. Thomas closed his eyes tight, feeling with
each his vein the creepy teeth of protruding rocks on the bottom of
the gorge. He resolved not to open eyes. <emphasis>If we fall, we
fall.</emphasis> He’d died of terror hundred times, what could be
more?</p>

<p>A knock on his back, and he was pressed on
the hard. The waterfall roared in his ears, that sound all but
drowned the thundering breath of Oleg, the rattling and screaming
in his chest. A dense water spray came all over them. Thomas opened
his eyes hastily. In the moonlight, he saw the wonderer’s face
distorted with pain, his lips bloodless, his nose sharp. They
lingered on a tiny stone ledge, in just fifteen or twenty feet over
the water. The waves lapped and thundered against the rocks, the
air was filled with water mist. The wonderer staggered at the very
brink, his eyes screwed up bus his arm stretched out over the edge,
lest Thomas fall into the seething stream.</p>

<p>Suddenly Oleg’s eyes started to close. He
sobbed, dropped to his knees, then fell on the side. Hastily,
Thomas snatched the hem of the wolfskin with his fettered hands,
kept Oleg on the stone ledge. The wonderer turned with a moan. With
his eyes closed, he groped and slapped around. Thomas froze when
the wonderer tore a dark wisp of grass out of a crack and put into
his mouth. He hurried to seize Oleg’s hand, but the wonderer was
already chewing with effort, then swallowing. Thomas saw Adam’s
apple struggling up his throat.</p>

<p>Suddenly a furious shout rang out far above.
Some noisy thing flew past them, hit the stones below. Thomas
tossed his head but could only see the overhanging rocky cover.</p>

<p>The wonderer was crawling at his feet,
grabbing something with both hands and filling his pocket, his jaws
moving constantly, his eyes goggled as a mad man’s, his lips
dripping with saliva. “Sir wonderer…” Thomas called. His voice gave
a quaver.</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head, as he kept slapping on
the rocky wall, searching the dark cracks. Finally, Thomas saw what
the wonderer was snatching: the grass that grew in slits among
stones. <emphasis>Hairy, loathsome, and disgusting like the back of a
drowned rat.</emphasis></p>

<p>Heavy rocks rushed down past them, the
columns of splashes reached their ledge. Oleg got up, clinging at
the wall, clasped Thomas silently around the middle of his body,
squat to shoulder him.</p>

<p>Thomas screamed in terror. “Sir wonderer! If
you have any strength left… save yourself! Off chance, as you put
it, a miracle happens and you will survive. And I’m to be saved by
no one.”</p>

<p>Oleg walked on the ledge, scratching the rock
with Thomas, until the ledge got so narrow that the wonderer clung
to the stone surface again and crawled down, clutching at the
smallest unevenness. Thomas had died hundred times before, but when
the splashes reached his legs he stiffened, tried instinctively to
tuck his feet up, but made himself relax again, hang like a sack of
sand, as the wonderer groaned of his squirms. Shamed, Thomas bit
his lip until it bled: he felt the wonderer’s back sticky and
soaked, but not with the waterfall splashes!</p>

<p>Suddenly Oleg slipped off a stone. Thomas’s
blood ran cold. The roaring water stream poured them over, wisps of
foam got stuck in the wonderer’s red hair.</p>

<p>For some long, agonizing moments Thomas
waited for death to come, but the water rushed by. At last, he saw
the wonderer was stuck between two boulders. <emphasis>He didn’t fell but
jumped down at will.</emphasis> The water was knee-deep, but splashes and
foam flew overhead. Thomas moaned, craving for a beautiful death
again. He forgot he was not galloping into knightly attack on his
warhorse and a beautiful death could hardly be achieved by the one
tied up, hand and foot.</p>

<p>Holding the knight as a log on his shoulder,
Oleg struggled on a smooth stone, measured the distance by eye,
jumped. Thomas opened his eyes wide involuntarily, as he saw
foaming streams among the rocks that protruded from water across
the mountain river. The roar made his ears crack, the icy foam
stuck up his eyes and mouth like glue… And the wonderer, with his
fatal wound, leapt heavily from one wet rock to another, slipped on
those wet giant eggs, but some miracle kept him from falling off,
he leapt again, his rattling more terrible with every jump, his
fingers getting weaker. Thomas saw a gap between rapids where the
wonderer, utterly exhausted, would probably drop his unbearable
load and fall down, his life burnt to ashes during those terrible
hours!</p>

<p>Oleg collapsed heavily, face first, on the
bank. Thomas rolled down from his back, glanced around in
bewilderment. They’d left the scary water stream behind!</p>

<p>Thomas touched Oleg’s shoulder, the wonderer
did not move. Thomas’s heart sank, he turned his friend’s head,
removed the dirt and river rubbish from his face to prevent
choking. The wonderer’s eyes were open but his stare stony
dead.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, friend,” Thomas said heavily. He
sobbed with burning shame of his being alive and chained, while the
wonderer died to save him.</p>

<p>Suddenly Oleg’s eyelashes flickered, his face
gave a twitch. The wonderer took a deep breath, fingers of his
right hand clenched convulsively. Thomas jumped up, his chains
rang. “Sir wonderer!” he cried. “Sir Oleg! Tell me: what to do?
Never mind the cup. I’ll go to your Scytho-Rus’, just tell what to
say of you! I’ll give the rest of our money to your family, don’t
worry!”</p>

<p>“Pocket…” Oleg croaked.</p>

<p>“What?” Thomas didn’t get it.</p>

<p>“In… po… cket…”</p>

<p>Hastily, Thomas put his fingers into the
wonderer’s pocket, then into another. It was difficult with
fettered hands. The familiar disgusting grass stuck to his
fingers.</p>

<p>“Give…”</p>

<p>Thomas obeyed, though with a shudder: put
several nasty grass blades into the wonderer’s stiffening mouth.
They were so small and entwined that seemed no grass but some
frozen fibers of whitish slime. Oleg tried to chew but could not
move his jaws, tried to swallow but his throat emitted dry heat
that burned Thomas’s fingers. The knight hurried to scoop some
water. It was spilled at once, but several drops got into the
wonderer’s mouth. He licked his lips slowly, made a forced
swallowing move.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer? Do you have a family?.. Please
tell me! I’ll tell them of your… of you!”</p>

<p>“And your Britain?” Oleg whispered
softly.</p>

<p>“I’ll get there later. From your
Russo-Scythia!”</p>

<p>“And Krizhina?”</p>

<p>Thomas felt as though stabbed in heart. With
the eyes of his mind, he saw valiant Roland who died while covering
the retreat of the force of his sovereign, Charles the Great.
Roland loved beautiful Alda, she waited for him. <emphasis>As a true
knight, he preferred friendship to love: dying, he said farewell
not to Alda but to Durendal, his spatha-sword…</emphasis> “I’ll go to your
Rus’,” he said firmly. “Or Ross. Wherever you like. You are a
Pagan… Please tell me how to bury you.”</p>

<p>“Hrrr… hrrr…”</p>

<p>“What?” Thomas cried. “Oh, anti-Christian
rite! With sacrifice and dancing? And singing, yeah? What songs
would you like?”</p>

<p>Oleg did not move. Suddenly he seemed dead to
Thomas. Through the roar of close waterfall, he could not hear
Oleg’s heavy breath, and the moon had found, by some miracle, a
cloud in the night sky and hid behind it. Thomas, frightened but
hopeless, shook his friend, clapped on his cheeks.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wonderer turned to him slowly
his pale face, which had turned gaunt at once, his eyes sunken.
“How are the arrows?”</p>

<p>Thomas clenched his jaws, examined the
wonderer’s back quickly. The dagger wound was not bleeding anymore
but the blood did not dry either: Oleg was soaked with water
splashes from head to feet, as well as Thomas. The second wound, on
his side, was only bleeding a bit, as if all the blood had gone out
before<emphasis>.</emphasis> Two tiny twigs stuck out under the shoulder blade.
Thomas gave a dull groan as he grasped that he’d been touching them
constantly while dangling, like a bag of stones, on the wonderer’s
back. “If only we reach a healer!” he said with sudden hope. “Sir
wonderer, we still have a chance…”</p>

<p>“Pull them out,” the wonderer said in a
lifeless voice. He lay prone, his arms outstretched, as though he
fell down from a great height. “The arrowheads are not deep in, I
feel…”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Thomas cried in terror. “I
can’t!”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll die,” the wonderer said
plainly.</p>

<p>Thomas sobbed, gripped the broken fragment of
arrow with his trembling fingers, but it, wet and soaked with
blood, slipped out of his weakened hands at once. The muscle on the
wonderer’s back, where the iron was stuck, gave a twitch. Thomas
bit his lip, with an ardent desire to die straight off but the
wonderer to become healthy instead.</p>

<p>“Pull slower,” Oleg croaked. “Do it very
slow!.. Or the head slips off.”</p>

<p>Thomas joined his fettered hands, dug his
nails into the wooden twig, started a long agonizing way above.
Blood gushed out at once, ran down the back!</p>

<p>When the skin started to swell (which was a
sign of the iron arrowhead approaching) Thomas stopped: the wooden
twig was coming out too quick. <emphasis>It slipped out of iron!</emphasis>
Holding the broken blooded twig to see the arrowhead bulging under
skin, Thomas pressed his mouth to, tried to get the lump moving
with his tooth, but the wonderer’s skin was too hard, tanned.
Thomas closed his eyes desperately, not to see the blood, pressed
the lump with teeth, holding it by the twig at the same time,
started biting through that sturdy, unyielding skin.</p>

<p>Blood filled his mouth, he gulped it down.
His head was giddy and dizzy, as if he were losing blood quickly
himself. His teeth grinded against the iron, he pulled the twig
with caution. A shapeless bloody lump came out of the wound: the
iron arrowhead caked in clots of blood. He heard mountains
collapse, horses neigh, and swords ring in his ears. Through all
that noise, a distant voice came, “Now you are my brother by blood.
Set to another…”</p>

<p>“You will bleed!”</p>

<p>“The water from glacier… Splash it over… To
set…”</p>

<p>With the arrowhead clenched in his teeth,
Thomas opened the second wound by cutting the live flesh, took the
arrow out, then, at once, started to scoop the icy water and splash
it on the blooded back. In the light of the breaking day, red
streams ran back into the mountain river. They were growing lighter
swiftly.</p>

<p>“E…nough!” the wonderer said with his teeth
clanging. “My wounds shut… Of fear, it seems… and cold…”</p>

<p>Thomas could not bend his fingers, frozen
like icicles. He could not feel his forearms, even his arms. The
wonderer turned with great effort, sat up, resting hands against
the ground. Yellow like a dead man, he became emaciated for that
only night, the features of his face sharp. He looked again like
the pilgrim whom Thomas had met beyond the walls of Jerusalem.</p>

<p>“We must go,” Oleg said in a constrained
voice. “Thomas… you may jump like a bird or crawl like a snake, but
we have to get away. There must be a bridge or a ferry somewhere.
Soon they’ll cross.”</p>

<p>“I see no bridge,” Thomas muttered
exhaustedly.</p>

<p>“This small river is no Dardanelles. And men
even cross oceans!” He got up, leaning on the stones, then risked
to take his hands off, stood for a while, staggering slightly. With
fear and amazement, Thomas looked in his gloomy strained face. Oleg
stopped swaying, turned his head. “Let’s go. They are coming. You
can lean on me…”</p>

<p>Breaking himself, Thomas started to rise from
the cold ground, thinking, with fear and perplexity, of the strange
things in life. The forty wonderers turned out to be the heroes
whose unheard-of might could shake kingdoms, and his wonderful
companion and friend and also his sworn brother, as Thomas had
tasted his blood… <emphasis>Who are they? What do they consider a true
feat if they neglect their present deeds? They sing of knights who
slew dragons, but these men killed the Hell’s monsters with all but
bare hands – and forgot it at once, as if those were flies they
drove away… And the wonderer does not see at all that each his step
now</emphasis> <strong><emphasis>is</emphasis></strong> <emphasis>a feat!</emphasis></p>

<p>He jumped after Oleg, his short chain rang,
bangles made his ankles sore. The wonderer glanced back often, and
Thomas saw with terror that his friend suffered more for him than
for himself.</p>

<p>He felt a strange fury for the wonderer boil
up in his soul. One good turn deserves another, and Thomas would
never be able to pay back with a similar deed. <emphasis>Suffering for
others is a thing of wild Paganism that fell under the victorious
blows of Christ’s faith. True, Christ suffered for others Himself,
but He was still a sinner at that time…</emphasis></p>

<p>He felt a current of hot air, went jumping
faster, fell down, rolled over, tried to proceed on his fours, but
the bloody chain was too short: he would have to bend his back like
a worm crawling along a stick… Thomas moaned through gritted teeth
but did not slow down, as he saw the wonderer suffering more. <emphasis>He
took my sin on his shoulders. Damned Pagan who behaves like the
ascetic of Nazareth…</emphasis></p>

<p>The wonderer stretched out his hand. “Lean,”
he said in a dull voice. “Easier to jump.”</p>

<p>“What?” Thomas snapped with insult.
“<emphasis>You</emphasis> lean!”</p>

<p>The wonderer still staggered but his feet did
not miss anymore. His pace grew steady, and Thomas, to his shame
and fear, fell the strength coming back to Oleg with every
moment.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 29</p>

<p>When they got out of the piles of stones,
there was a valley, green as the surface of an old bog. Trees stuck
out of the carpeting grass in small close groups, very distinctive
on the plain, as flat as a table. In places there also were curly
bushes: thick, crowded, their branches very close, as though
holding the line against the attacking hosts of grass and
thistle.</p>

<p>Through pain and pounding in head, Thomas
felt being supported, in times even dragged by strong hands. They
hobbled up to the nearest shrubs and fell down into the shade: the
sun was high. Thomas breathed frequently, his chest uttered
rattling, screeching sounds, as though a knife scratching a
pan.</p>

<p>“Be patient,” the wonderer told him in a
husky voice. “When it darks, I’ll steal into a village. You hear
dogs? It’s close. I’ll take a hammer, some pincers…”</p>

<p>Helplessly, Thomas felt his chains. Thick
links were in blood – his blood. The iron bangles had chafed his
legs up to flesh, almost up to bone, the sores oozed with blood and
ichor constantly, the pain in times made all go dark before his
eyes. “You won’t reach the village!”</p>

<p>“I will! Slavic children are taught to steel
up to a wild goose, so that to pull a feather out of its bum. I’m
no Christian, feel no shame in filching a hammer. Though I’d leave
a coin instead… If I had any.”</p>

<p>“Are you strong enough?”</p>

<p>“Now I am,” the wonderer answered
mysteriously.</p>

<p>“How did you gain strength?”</p>

<p>The wonderer did not reply: he was dead to
the world. Helpless, Thomas sprawled on the grass in the shadow of
a tree. Exhaustion fell upon him, like a warhorse in full armor. He
lapsed into a doze.</p>

<p>His waking up was terrible: a rattle nearby,
Thomas gripped the sword hilt, but his arm was flinched with pain,
he heard a tinkle of chain… and there was no sword. He lay on his
back, three tower-like men with coarse faces stood over him. They
were clad in leathers, convenient for hunting, with bows over their
shoulders, heavy knives on their belts. All the three had short
spears in hands, the iron spearheads leaned on Thomas’s belly and
under his ribs.</p>

<p>The wonderer lay bound tightly, the right
side of his face covered with fresh blood. Thomas closed his eyes
in helpless despair, groaned through gritted teeth. “Our Lady, what
for?.. For the second time! So foolish…”</p>

<p>One of the hunters bared his crooked black
teeth in a broad smirk. “Haven’t fought for long time, you
villain?.. Get up!”</p>

<p>Nearby, the wonderer was jerked up by his
tied hands and held up: he was sinking, his knees giving way, his
head dropped on the breast. Thomas looked in the faces desperately:
all strangers. “What do you want?”</p>

<p>The older hunter looked surprised. “We?
Nothing. Take you to master, for him to decide. It’s clear you are
runaway slaves… Or some outlaws broken out of prison?”</p>

<p>“We are not outlaws,” Thomas moaned.</p>

<p>“Why chained then, you? Defiler, yeah? I see
it by your mug.”</p>

<p>Thomas gnashed his teeth, nodded at the
wonderer. “And he? Let him go… He is not chained.”</p>

<p>“Why’d he hobnob with you?” the hunter asked
sober-mindedly. “Either helped you or a sort of that… If not
guilty, we let him go. Our master’s a beast, but a fair beast. He
will let you go too if finds out you chained for nothing. But don’t
be too hopeful: such chains are never put on for nothing!”</p>

<p>They were thrown across the saddles and bound
tightly. The only man who escorted them drove horses fast. The rest
had galloped away, shrieking, as they saw a deer. Thomas started to
twitch fervently, trying to weaken the ropes at least, but the
beautiful house of white stone was growing ahead too quickly: a
light mansion, its roof supported by pillars of show-white marble,
open to the light of southern sun.</p>

<p>A young boy ran out to meet them, flung open
the gate that was easy to jump over for a pregnant hare. The master
of the castle seemed to be carefree: either a fool or the very name
of him kept villains away.</p>

<p>The well-groomed grass crept under hooves.
The palace towered ahead, but the horses were led past stables to a
gloomy bran formed by massive granite slabs. The gate squeaked
open, captives were hurled into. The gate bars thundered outside:
one, two, three, and a padlock was hung on with a thud. A stern
voice commanded invisible guards to keep their eyes skinned: if
they leave their guard even for a moment, both would be fed to
dogs, just like the runaway wench who tried to escape the master’s
bed the week before.</p>

<p>Thomas waited until his eyes got a bit used
to the dark, then called quietly. “Sir wonderer… are you
alive?”</p>

<p>He heard a feeble moan. “My head
smashed…”</p>

<p>“It is the end of us,” Thomas said with a
creepy feeling of doom. “It is! Not because we got captured but
because it’s the second time I blundered on my watch. The second
time they took us sleepy! Two times in a row! I beheaded sentinels
who guarded our hosts from Saracen for such things.”</p>

<p>He heard a faint voice in the dispersing
dark. “What watch, Sir Thomas?.. Don’t be foolish. We were both
half-dead.”</p>

<p>Oleg tossed in his corner, groaned, squirmed,
gnashed his teeth. A strip of bright light penetrated under the
door. Thomas’s eyes accommodated, he could see protruding stones in
the walls, dirty hay on the floor.</p>

<p>“Dark…” a hoarse voice came from the corner.
“Or it’s my eyes?.. Sir Thomas, is it night?”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his back snowed. He moved his
shoulder blades, as though a wet icicle slipped by the scruff of
his neck. “Take heart, sir wonderer.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Oleg croaked, “I see now it’s dark…
in me…”</p>

<p>Squirming, bending in torment, he scratched
some whitish thing out of his pocket, with fingertips of his tied
hands, bent his palms with effort in the opposite direction,
brought to his mouth. Thomas felt a sharp smell, watched closely
and gave a start: his friend’s lips were in yellow big-bubbled
foam. “A rare moss…” the wonderer croaked. “Extinct all but
everywhere, survived here. We in our woods call it overcome grass.
I’ll die soon, Sir Thomas, but first I make you free.”</p>

<p>“How?!” Thomas exclaimed in disbelief.</p>

<p>“The overcome grass gives strength… Then one
dies, like a fly in the frost.”</p>

<p>“Poison?”</p>

<p>“Each man has some strength in store… like a
hamster in his burrow… Overcome grass is to release all of it at
once. That’s why he dies – he has no strength to live anymore…”</p>

<p>He brought to his mouth the whitish fibers,
the biggest of which looked like blind worms that live in deep
caves where God’s light can’t reach. Thomas caught his hand, tore
the disgusting fibers off his palm and threw into own mouth.
Twisted with disgust, he started to chew, his palate and tongue got
burnt at once, his mouth hot, as though he swallowed a red-hot
horseshoe. His stomach twitched, started to climb hastily up his
throat.</p>

<p>Thomas overcame sickness and swallowed. A
ball of fire sank down his larynx, kicked down the stomach that was
climbing from below, and both came down as a burning avalanche. He
felt something in his belly ooh, toss, and jump. “We’ll die
together!” he claimed firmly.</p>

<p>“Don’t be stupid…” the wonderer whispered
with his heavy, swollen eyelids lowered. “What about Holy Grail?..
Krizhina?”</p>

<p>Thomas closed his eyes tight. He hated
himself for all the trouble he had brought on his friend. “Isn’t it
a disgrace to leave you to death?.. And more disgrace to save
myself at your expense.”</p>

<p>“But Krizhina?”</p>

<p>“I don’t want her to be a wife of disgraceful
man.”</p>

<p>“And Holy Grail?”</p>

<p>“He was searched by the Knights of the Round
Table, as far back… They found it and lost again! Now I see it were
the Secret Seven who hampered them too… But I believe that, though
I now lose it, my good young Britain will have another brave
knights who, eventually, shall bring the Holy Grail to its
shores.”</p>

<p>The wonderer turned side to him silently.
Thomas divided the rest of the moss, as disgusting as nothing on
earth, in two equal parts. “Chew it. We shall die as men.”</p>

<p>Imperceptibly, his legs, sore with fetters,
stopped aching. His bleeding wrists got covered with dry rustling
scab. Thomas shifted his stunned eyes to the wonderer: he grasped
that when Oleg had chewed that slick muck for the first time, over
the waterfall, all the strength he gained was used to heal the
terrible wounds faster. And now – Thomas blazed with shame and
disgrace – he burnt down the rest, trying to help Thomas, his
random companion. The faithful friend, a peaceful seeker of Truth
would die first of him, a man of war? A brass head, as old men put
it, though his forehead was covered by no brass but shining
steel…</p>

<p>Thomas gnashed his teeth, depressed by the
feeling of guilt. “When does that moss take effect?” he asked
angrily.</p>

<p>“It’s ancient overcome grass…”</p>

<p>Through the wall of the barn, they heard
heavy steps. The bars thundered, the door flew open with a
heartrending screech. In the bright sunlight, a squat man in red
shirt, with a crimson brand on his forehead and heavy eyebrows,
appeared on the threshold. With his gimlet-like eyes, he inspected
the tied-up captives quickly, lingered his look on the wonderer,
whose face was covered with stabs of dry blood. “Who fed them?” he
asked in a creepy voice that seemed to be coming from his
belly.</p>

<p>Behind him, some men in leather jackets get
moving anxiously. They sounded like frightened birds. “No one!.. We
swear it!.. Never, none of us would!..”</p>

<p>“Why they slobber?”</p>

<p>“Gnawed at the walls with hunger! Moldy,
mossy as they are…”</p>

<p>The branded man stepped into, stopped before
Thomas, kicked him in face. Thomas’s head jerked with his blow. The
branded man’s smile got broader, he kicked the captive again with
his shoed boot, a brass flourish glittered dimly on the toe. “Get
up, you carrion!” he roared terribly. “Live carrion, but how close
to dead! Now you’ll be sorted out.” The hunters came after him, set
their short spears (the heads of those looked more like knives) at
Thomas and Oleg from three sides. The wonderer stood and went out
first, having cast a warning glance at Thomas.</p>

<p>The green yard was flooded with bright
sunlight but the air cool and fresh. A young ripe girl was carrying
a wooden barrel across the yard, her body a beautiful curve. Water
splashed over the brim, clear drops glittered like pearls. She
glanced slantwise at the bashed, tied-up captives, one of them
ringing with fetters, and smiled vacantly, showing her even white
teeth.</p>

<p>Behind the barn gate, two more guards
advanced their spears and that way, in a tight ring, captives were
led across the yard into the palace that looked like a dream made
of white lace. On the stairs, broad and sparkling in the sunlight,
they were met by two armored warriors. One tripped the wonderer up
silently and, as he stumbled, roared and whacked him on his back
with the thick end of spear. Thomas, beside himself with fury – the
wonderer had two wounds of arrows and one of dagger on his back! –
jumped on the guard, gripped him by breast with tied hands, his
strong fingers pinched his skin together with mail, lifted up into
the air and hurled forcefully down to his feet.</p>

<p>He did not feel the blow, only a thunder in
head, a flash of lighting, and he fell down, face first, but even
as he lost consciousness, his lips curled in a smile.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” a stern voice over him called
insistently, “come to yourself, now! Or you’ll die.” Once Thomas
heard that familiar voice, he plunged, with effort, out of the
black oblivion. The back of his head was still aching of the blow
landed by the axe butt. He felt salty taste in his mouth.</p>

<p>The smooth marble floor was a pleasant cold
to his bashed body. He and the wonderer were in a great hall: tall
marble pillars on three sides, instead of usual walls, supporting
the massive vault. The mosaic ceiling pictured flying cupids,
goat-like satyrs jumping in embrace with naiads, maenads, and other
impious characters of Hellenic Paganism. Oleg’s anxious face hung
over Thomas, covering the ceiling: his eyes in dark circles, his
cheek blooded. Behind him, the sun was shining brightly, and the
wonderer’s face seemed completely dark.</p>

<p>In three steps, a red-bearded man in rich
clothes was sitting on a high carved chair that looked like a
throne. The eyes on his puffy face were cold and cruel. Two stocky
guards with battleaxes stood near him, goggling their eyes. Two
other guards shifted their feet impatiently near Oleg, touched his
ribs threateningly with iron spearheads. The jailer with branded
forehead and three hunters stood near the pillars.</p>

<p>Thomas moved his hands, but the iron chains
kept them firmly. The wonderer stood with his shoulders leaned
back, trying to relieve the pain in his arms pinioned behind.</p>

<p>“If doesn’t come to,” a new voice said,
imperious and impatient, “throw him to dogs!.. And you answer: why
are you chained while he is not?”</p>

<p>Two guards grabbed Thomas by hands, dragged
across the hall. When they approached the stairs, the sun came out
of the edge of the ceiling, shone into his eyes. Thomas closed
them, groped for the guards’ arms, caught them, and pulled on. Both
men collapsed, shrieking. Thomas squeezed their necks with joy, got
up to his feet heavily. The guards remained lying in odd poses,
their heads wrenched in a strange way.</p>

<p>Two men with battleaxes recovered their wits,
rushed to him. The sun glared on their raised axes.</p>

<p>“All stop!” the man on the carved throne
shouted. The warriors stopped, their eyes watched every move of
Thomas in a guarded way. He shot a glance at the wonderer: Oleg did
not move and gave Thomas a sign to stand still too.</p>

<p>Thomas turned to the master. “Why do you keep
us?”</p>

<p>The man descended from his throne, stopped in
three steps before the knight. His dark eyes looked with
perplexity: that way a wolf could look at a hare who dug his
suddenly big teeth into his paw. “Who are you?”</p>

<p>“Thomas Malton of Gisland,” the knight cut
short with dignity. “A noble knight, seven generations of noble
ancestors! Championed over the Black Knight on the tourney in
Manchester. The first crusader to rise on the Tower of David.
Commander of the hundred who broke into Jerusalem.”</p>

<p>The man waved away, as though driving an
importunate fly. “Never heard of that. The Tower of David – where’s
it? Jerusalem – what’s it?.. Here are different lands, noble
captive. I’m a man of Sezuan. I’m known as Rocambole the Quietest.
I took you in my lands – and have a right to do what I wish to. And
I will do it. But listen to your excuses first.”</p>

<p>“We are not going to give any excuses,”
Thomas said angrily.</p>

<p>Rocambole turned his head a bit, cried over
shoulder. “Gnusak! Prepare the torture chamber. Make a <emphasis>good</emphasis>
fire. What’s burning now once made seven tents of Gypsies freeze to
death… Check the pincers. What will you pull out teeth and other
organs with?.. And don’t forget the boot!”</p>

<p>The branded man bowed, rushed across the
yard. Rocambole turned to Thomas, his lips curved in a predatory
smile, his eyes goggled like a rare sea fish’s. “You will tell all
of it, noble knight! Not the first to be carried out of my cellar
in pieces. Or fed to dogs while alive – I always keep them
half-starving.”</p>

<p>Thomas scowled, his eyebrows collided on the
bridge of the nose. “You are no Saracen but European! How can
you…”</p>

<p>Rocambole roared with laughter. “Saracens
have never even dreamed of what we do in our cellars! We are young
nation, still wild! We can do everything.”</p>

<p>There were fast steps on the stairs. The
branded man came in sight, cried out, panting, “All is ready,
master! Executioners wait, the fire burns… Pinches and hooks
sharpened!”</p>

<p>Rocambole bared his teeth in a predatory
smile, nodded to guards. Thomas and Oleg were encircled by shining
spears, two spearheads pierced Thomas’s back from behind. Rocambole
nodded again, and captives were driven away from the hall.</p>

<p>They were coming downstairs into the yard,
when a ringing clatter of hooves came from far ahead. Five riders,
armed to the teeth, in iron helmets, on clothed horses, jumped over
the low fence into the yard. The first of them was… Gorvel!</p>

<p>Some blooded cloths peeped from under his
solid cylindrical helmet. His right shoulder was bound tightly with
a white towel that had large red-hot spots of blood on it. Gorvel
was followed by four gloomy warriors, all big and armored. It took
Thomas some time to recognize Paul and Stelmah among them.</p>

<p>Gorvel reined up before the stairs. “Aha!” he
cried in a strained voice. “Got you at last! Slash these stinkers!
Slash them now!”</p>

<p>The four warriors drove their horses in a
slow pace to the marble stairs. Sabers in their hands glittered in
the sunlight, casting bright sparkles.</p>

<p>Rocambole stepped ahead, on the topmost
stair. “Who are you?” he bellowed in an angry, enraged voice. “Who
allowed… in my lands?”</p>

<p>Gorvel shot a fierce glance at him and told
angrily the dressed-up, like a peacock, master of the sumptuous
palace to go to very far lands. Gorvel’s men laughed, sabers in
their hands scattered fine sharp sparkles around.</p>

<p>Rocambole grew crimson, made a step back,
waved his hand abruptly. Stelmah rode up to Thomas, raised the
saber over his head with a malevolent smirk. Suddenly his fingers
unclenched, the saber fell down and went bouncing on the white
marble. Thomas looked up and recoiled: a crossbow bolt was in
Stelmah’s forehead, it had broken through his iron helmet.</p>

<p>He heard a loud clang of sword aside. Paul
leaned back in his saddle, his arms outstretched wide, as though to
grapple all the world. A steel bolt was between his eyes. Behind
the pillars, three more crossbowmen shouldered their weapons,
aiming at Gorvel and his men. The first two crossbowmen turned
wrenches hastily, drawing the steel bowstrings.</p>

<p>From the stone barns in the yard, even from
the stables, armored warriors came out: two or three scores in
total. Gorvel and two of his survived soldiers got encircled with
malicious glitter of swords, axes, jagged spearheads.</p>

<p>Rocambole was covered with shields from both
sides. He spoke in a loud cold voice that sounded like death
itself. “What would you say as your excuse, worm? I’m ready to
listen, though I’ll treat you as I wish… Gnusak, is the furnace
burning?”</p>

<p>The branded man rubbed his hands with joy,
shrieked with delight. “If short of firewood, I bring new in my
teeth! Three more came, eh! Came running by themselves, no need to
search!”</p>

<p>Gorvel fidgeted in his saddle, looked over
the cruel smirking faces in fear. He was surrounded tightly,
reached for by predatory hands to drag him down, and the damned
crossbowmen – seven of them! – kept aiming at him. He jerked his
hand up hastily, to drive Rocambole’s attention, made a strange
move across his breast, as though drawing an acute angle.</p>

<p>Rocambole’s eyes opened wide, he started
back, as though pushed on the breast. Warily, he put his fingers
together, drew a strange sign in the air. Gorvel bent his head.
“All back!” Rocambole said, very reluctantly, hoarse of his voice
at once. “These are no enemies.”</p>

<p>His warriors retreated, grumbling like
animals when driven into cages. Swords and axes, which were raised
overhead, went down but remained in hands, while scabbards and
covers empty. Their sullen faces showed severe disappointment. Four
of them picked up the bodies, dragged away, leaving bloody traces
on the white marble stairs. The dead men’s saber and sword were
taken away then. The crossbowmen lowered their weapons, but stayed
on spot, with drawn steel strings.</p>

<p>Gorvel rode up to Thomas, his voice a dull
thrash in the steel basket of his helmet. “You didn’t escape, our
mortal… and my personal enemy!”</p>

<p>Thomas, with complete ignorance of the heavy
rider hanging over them, turned to Oleg. “This scoundrel is doomed
to Hell… but he’s already got it here, in his lifetime!”</p>

<p>“Spit,” Oleg advised him. “Don’t even think
of him.”</p>

<p>Gorvel struck Thomas forcefully on his face.
The knight’s head jerked, but he kept his feet, made no step back.
With a heavy scuff, Gorvel made a broader swing and smote with
great force, trying to smash lips with his gauntlet. Thomas shook
his head slightly again, glanced askew at the wonderer who told him
sadly, “You revive?.. I’m brimming over… as I had a chew before…”
He could hardly move his tongue.</p>

<p>Rocambole, with his beastly senses, felt
something wrong. “To the torture chamber!” he cried anxiously.
“There we’ll know all.”</p>

<p>Guards gripped the wonderer from both sides,
hung on his shoulders. He gave a terrible, inhuman roar. the ropes
cracked, then flew up, like thin supple snakes. In two giant leaps,
he got on the topmost stair, struck with his fist, and Rocambole
made a long arch in the air, fell on the ground before the stunned
guards and remained there. motionless.</p>

<p>Thomas strained, tore his chains. The iron
endured, but he felt violent might, made a stronger jerk, and his
arms flew apart! He stooped hastily, seized the chain on his legs.
A ringing crunch, and the end of the crumpled chain remained in
hand. With no stop, he crushed the guards who tried to drag him
into the cellar, trampled over someone and squashed, rushed after
the wonderer.</p>

<p>The rest ran after him, screaming. Gorvel
urged his horse upstairs, hooves slid on the smooth marble, the
frightened horse stopped and backed.</p>

<p>“Too late!” Oleg cried in a thundering voice.
He struck his whole body against a snow-white pillar. Cracks ran
down the shiny stone, the pillar bent in the opposite direction,
two or three heavy boulders fell out, as though battered with a
ram, thundered down the stairs with a thunder, knocking and maiming
the guards who ran up.</p>

<p>Thomas gripped another pillar, shook it,
imitating the wonderer, but the marble column endured: the roof
kept it. In three steps Oleg fell down to dodge the thrown spear,
rolled over his head, struck another pillar in his jump. There was
a crash above, the colored mosaic started to fall down with a
ringing of glass. In place of the pillar, a broad stone stump
remained. Heavy boulders rolled in all directions, knocking the
guards down, but the heavy castle roof endured, only subsided a
bit, showering with no more rain but a colored hail of small pieces
of glass and stone.</p>

<p>Oleg ran into the third pillar, knocked it
down and reached the fourth one when there came a terrible thunder,
a heavy stone slab fell near him, small broken fragments flew
sideways. He heard shouts of crushed people, and a stone avalanche
came on.</p>

<p>Oleg felt a painful hit on his shoulder.
Boulders and slabs were collapsing on him, bas-reliefs, flying
nymphs, and headless satyrs darted past. Through a cloud of
sparkling dust and fine stone crumbs, he saw the mighty figure of
Thomas who snatched, squeezed, threw aside, and snatched again.
Then the mass of falling stones and the collapsed roof hid the
knight. Oleg dashed there, jumping over the heaps of marble, seeing
nothing in the dust cloud. “Thomas!.. Sir Thomas!.. Sir Thomas,
where are you?”</p>

<p>Slowly, it grew lighter, the thunder died
down. Oleg saw there was no more roof, the sun rays burning the
dusty cloud through. It subsided very quickly: that was the dust of
marble. “Thomas!” he shouted again. “Where are you?”</p>

<p>The colossal palace was reduced to ruins.
Oleg stood waist-deep in white broken stone. The stamps of pillars
stuck out, like giant’s teeth, huge boulders had rolled about the
green yard. The cloud of heavy marble dust had subsided, forming a
silvery coating on the ruins and the grass in the yard.</p>

<p>A small stream of blood came out from under
ruins near Oleg. In fear, he threw the stones about and saw two
guards lying crisscross. Both looked like toads squashed by a cart
wheel. “Thomas!.. Sir Thomas!”</p>

<p>A moan came from the left. Oleg started to
throw away the boulders, broken fragments, found protruding legs.
Before he could remove the last stones, the whole heap gave a stir,
then scattered, and Thomas stood up straight. His eyes were mad, he
swayed, grabbing at the air. The torn pieces of chain were ringing
on his wrists.</p>

<p>“Were you socked on head?” Oleg asked in his
ear.</p>

<p>“I saw the Virgin…” Thomas whispered madly.
“First some lightnings flashed, then stars came raining down, then
a Pagan god seemed to have socked on the back of my head with his
hammer… Sir wonderer, why does everyone strike at the same
place?”</p>

<p>“All people are the same,” Oleg muttered.
“The prophet of yours said: there is no Gentile or Jew. It means
everyone is the same, like planks in a fence. You should have
chewed the overcome grass, not swallow it like a hungry duck!”</p>

<p>Two warriors were running from the gate: all
the rest of Rocambole’s guard. They yelled with goggled eyes, their
swords dangled on belts. The first one saw Thomas and Oleg among
ruins, pulled his sword out in the run.</p>

<p>Oleg picked up a huge stone, as large as a
horse, threw towards the warriors. It hit heavily against the
ground in front of them, loosened the earth, jumped and rolled on,
its edge knocked one of the guards down, then the rock smashed the
gate and rolled out on the road. The guard remained lying, his
healthy hand clutching the injured shoulder. The second one
stopped, looked at the strange guests, then at his injured friend,
and backed.</p>

<p>Thomas limped heavily across the yard to the
utility outhouses. Frightened horses neighed in the stables, the
gate cracked. Oleg got out of the ruins and hurried after Thomas.
His head was strangely light.</p>

<p>Thomas knocked the gate out, chose horses.
Oleg examined them and approved: the knight knew horses better than
he knew men. He kept the frightened horses easily, though he had
very little of overcome grass, as Oleg had chewed the rest. “Sir
wonderer, how long is the effect of overcome grass?”</p>

<p>“The sun is setting,” Oleg replied heavily.
“By midnight, it will end…”</p>

<p>“So little?.. We have to take the Holy Grail
before midnight! And then we can die, as good Christians…”</p>

<p>“I’m Rodian,” Oleg reminded gloomily.</p>

<p>They rushed out of the gate like a whirlwind,
but to Oleg they seemed as slow-moving as freezing snails. Thomas
also kept urging, with no real need, the frightened horses who
still could not recover from that terrible thunder.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back at the white heap of
stones. “Too good sepulcher for your friend!” he said sulkily.</p>

<p>“Christ told us to forgive,” Thomas sighed
insincerely. “Devil will have a long digging in the ruins before he
finds the scoundrel’s soul pressed under… Surely, it’s disgusting
to take in hands, but he will need to take it to Hell.”</p>

<p>“He can put it straight into his bag,” Oleg
advised.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 30</p>

<p>The sun sank behind the horizon to a half
when their road brought them up a hill, from where they could see a
high massive castle towering on the hill that had evidently been
erected for that very purpose, surrounded by a stone rampart and
encircled with a moat of water. A broad drawbridge was thrown
across the moat, its thick iron chains glittered in the light of
sunset.</p>

<p>“Are you sure,” Thomas asked nervously, “the
cup was taken there?”</p>

<p>“No other castle nearby,” Oleg replied
without much conviction. “And my charms say your cup is there.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced slantwise at the wonderer.
Ragged, bashed, and worn out, he managed to keep his charms. Though
Kite’s hirelings had touched them (Thomas saw it), they were not
tempted by a wooden necklace, especially this one: carved roughly,
without proper skill.</p>

<p>Horses, wheezing and dripping with foam,
brought them up to the gate. By that time the plain was striped
with reddish-black shadows. Only a crimson edge still stuck over
the skyline, then it sank too, and the dusk fell.</p>

<p>A head in glittering helmet rose over the
castle gate. The man was sullen, his face irritated, his eyes under
swollen eyelids looked with malice.</p>

<p>Thomas, still ahorse, knocked on the
iron-riveted logs of the gate. “Hey, over there! Open!”</p>

<p>“Who you are?” the guard inquired in a voice
viscous like old syrup.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at Oleg’s rags, at his own
torn remnants of clothing that hung on him like on a scarecrow. The
iron bangles glittered dimly on his hands and legs, the fragments
of chains rang. “Don’t you see, numskull? Godly travelers!
Pilgrims! Open it, now.”</p>

<p>The guard leaned forward to have a better
look at the godly travelers who yelled and swore like villains.
“Oh, I see how godly!.. Wait ‘ill morning. Steward comes an’ sorts
out.”</p>

<p>“Till morning?” Thomas cried in a scared
voice. “It’s not even night now!”</p>

<p>“Soon it be,” the guard explained in a more
friendly tone. “Night and day to while away. Have to while a day,
and night… we won’t see it, thank God. Our place quiet, what they
want here? Can’t stay at home. Roam, roam…” He scratched himself
noisily, gave a wolfish, howling yawn.</p>

<p>Thomas gasped with fury. Oleg dismounted,
with his face mournful. “Brother Thomas,” he said gently, “please
hold my horse. That’s the world created by Rod: people would rather
obey strength than truth. Take the horses back, and I’ll knock out
the gate of this vile pigsty.”</p>

<p>The guard above burst with resonant laughter,
his ill yellow face turned crimson. “Knock out?.. Ha ha!.. Saracen
tried it with ram!.. An’ had hard time, like bears near fish…”</p>

<p>Oleg backed three steps, puffed up, held his
breath. The guard neighed merrily, but Oleg rushed on the gate
suddenly, hit against the tightly-knocked-together logs. Thomas
shuddered with terrible crash, thunder, the screech of iron strips
torn apart. Horses jumped, trying to break off the bridge into the
moat, Thomas held them with iron hand. When he looked at the gate
again, he could not believe his eyes. It seemed to be smashed with
a rock from a giant catapult. Huge bars kept the folds from flying
open, but the whole gate had been broken out: it lay in the yard in
twenty feet from the breach. The walls of the stone arch had gaps
from torn-out rods, the crumble of bricks rained down.</p>

<p>The wonderer lay, sprawled like a frog, on
the gate: he looked like having slid there on ice that way. Thomas
barely had time to turn horses when Oleg rose, beating the brick
dust and small crumbles loudly off his clothes and swearing as only
can swear a pilgrim who saw a lot of the world, passed Crimea and
Rome, spent a night under the priest’s pear tree, not to mention
Jerusalem where every Tom, Dick and Harry had been to.</p>

<p>Thomas rode through the breach proudly,
leading the wonderer’s horse by reins. The survived guard was
hanging above, shrieking shrilly. He was no more crimson but white,
his feet scratched the air helplessly.</p>

<p>Other guards ran out of the building near the
gate, stunned by the thunder. Their eyes popped out as they saw, in
place of their indestructible gate, a gaping forest, far and dark,
with some unwell blow coming from there. Massive hooks and hinges
that had once been holding the heavy gate folds stuck out from the
walls on both sides.</p>

<p>Thomas stopped the second horse near Oleg who
was still beating small pebbles off his rags with disgust. Thomas
pointed at the empty saddle, Oleg waved away sullenly. “Mounting,
dismounting… What a monotonous life! ”</p>

<p>He walked across the yard to the main
building. Some warriors ran down the porch, clanging with steel.
Thomas kept snatching his hip: no sword there anymore.</p>

<p>They were surrounded, but Oleg, with no look
at the warriors at all, went straight upstairs. Thomas vaulted off,
threw the reins arrogantly into the face of the closest clot with
axe in hands, and followed the wonderer. He heard a shriek behind:
as the clot was grabbing the reins, he dropped the axe on his foot
and went yelling, hopping along, gripping the injured foot with
both hands, while horses, still trembling with fear, bustled about
the yard.</p>

<p>The stone stairs were not pressed into the
ground by their feet, as Thomas apprehended, not a single one even
cracked. With relief, he realized that, despite all the monstrous
strength, his weight was the same, as the bunches of overcome grass
weighed less than a dead mouse.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg came into the entrance hall,
which was all lit by the crimson light of a huge blazing fireplace
near the far wall. Two armored men dried some cloths by the fire,
their waders dried on the iron fender. There was a smell of fish
pluck. Both men glanced over with surprise at the strange ragged
newcomers who were followed, at a respectful distance, by three
apprehensive soldiers with bare swords.</p>

<p>Oleg got tired of clanging sounds behind. He
wheeled round suddenly, made a horrific grimace, and stamped his
feet. The three soldiers were blown away at once, as though by
hurricane. They collided at the door, a dropped sword rang, then a
heavy body was heard to be rolling downstairs, crackling,
crunching, and rattling. Thomas made a move to come back for the
sword, which lay on the threshold and shimmered like a toadstool in
the moonlight, but Oleg clutched his hand tightly. “Sir monk, do
arms befit us?”</p>

<p>Thomas released himself with caution, his
face grew white, his eyes suffering. “Sir wonderer, one should
<emphasis>eat</emphasis> overcome grass, not gorge on it like a horse!”</p>

<p>Oleg replied in a grieving voice. “Grasses
are to be found nowhere in our land in winter! Unlike these lands,
where they have only summer. We hyperboreans have a habit to get
full up at once.”</p>

<p>They passed the hall. A guard jumped away
from the ornate inner door: something warned him not to stop the
strange vagrants. Thomas kicked the door open before Oleg could do
it. The folds flew open with a crack, the door bar, wrenched out
roughly, flopped on the floor, some debris rained down from the
ceiling.</p>

<p>The great hall was decorated with swords,
axes, maces, and knightly shields over the carpets on the walls. In
the middle, two tables were surrounded by benches made of halves of
a split oak. Oleg nodded to Thomas, explaining silently that was a
measure against brawlers who could, in full swing of a feast, lift
a bench and brandish it, crushing others.</p>

<p>Both tables were formed by thick marble slabs
rested on grey square blocks of stone. There were blazing
fireplaces on two opposite walls, a good smell of fragrant smoke
and burnt hair. The floor was made of huge slabs, the same as the
walls of that gloomy castle, the cracks stuck with grey clay.
However, the heavy blocks were fitted so tight that an ant could
hardly pass between any of them.</p>

<p>Thomas sat down at the table and spoke
haughtily, addressing no one in particular. “Hey, lord!.. Run for
him, you bow-legged! I’ll have all of you flogged!”</p>

<p>Some heads, in horned helmets and without
those, peeped into the door the friends had come through. Thomas’s
menacing roar made the heads vanish. After a while, they came back,
but not all of them.</p>

<p>Oleg walked along the walls, examined the
arms. His heart pounded resonantly, about to get smashed up against
the rib cage. Should he approach the door, the heads vanished and
fast thumping was heard from the stairs, as though some scattered
peas rolled down up to the cellar.</p>

<p>They heard a heavy ringing sound from the far
door. A tall man emerged there: clad in iron armor all over, he
looked so alike a metal stature that Oleg turned his head
involuntarily to check whether Thomas was in place. Thomas, all
ragged, his hands and feet bare, pulled an understanding smirk
on.</p>

<p>The other knight was covered with gleaming
steel from head to feet, but his raised visor allowed to see a
narrow weather-beaten face, a red face burnt mercilessly by the
southern sun. When he stepped in, some warriors appeared behind
him, with a glitter of swords and heavy axes in their hands.</p>

<p>One of the warriors held a blazing torch, but
the knight’s face was in the shade.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” the knight roared, his hand on
the hilt of huge sword. He sounded like a lion and his voice,
however closely Oleg listened to it, had no hint of confusion or
fear, which are so often concealed by a might roar – only surprise
and curiosity.</p>

<p>Oleg was silent, collecting his thoughts.
Thomas glanced slantwise at him, replied in a deliberately meek
voice, mimicking his friend. “We… humble pilgrims… Go from Holy
Sepulcher to Rus’. Live like song birds: walking roads, pecking
dung… Singin’ praises to Holy Virgin… Wearin’ fetters…” He raised
his hands to demonstrate the steel bangles that had rubbed his
flesh away up to the bone. The chain fragments gave a tinkle.</p>

<p>The knight came, in a slow pace, up to the
table where Thomas sat. His armor rang at every step, which made
Thomas flinch with jealousy. The warriors came in after him but
they dispersed along the walls. Each second man had a shiny
broad-headed Saracen spear.</p>

<p>The knight stopped in two steps from Thomas,
peered at him. “Humble pilgrims, eh? Since when has Thomas Malton
of Gisland-on-Don become a humble vagrant? You used to go to sleep
with no wench but with your sword!”</p>

<p>Thomas gave a start but kept his seat,
replied in a slow controlled voice. “As you see, Sir Burlan, I have
no sword now.”</p>

<p>“Neither a wench,” the knight spoke in an
unpleasant voice, in which one could hear a jeer. “Only a pilgrim
friend instead… ahem. In this land, one picks up a fever, another
picks vile habits… Have you lost your sword?”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed, blood rushed up to his cheeks
at once, but with a visible effort he made his shoulders relax,
replied in an even voice. “With the help of Our Lady, we get what
we want without a sword. This land only base folk, and I bare my
noble sword only for noble foes. For example, the one who stole the
Holy Grail earned his death of my bare hand… No, was killed like a
dog – by the stone I hurled at him. And now I came for the Holy
Grail!”</p>

<p>Burlan’s eyes were the color of water running
over the river boulders. His eyelids all but closed, as he narrowed
his eyes in a predatory way. “If you come without armor, like a
bird without feathers… <emphasis>like a plucked crow</emphasis>, as we knights
put it, you shall be treated with as much honor as a common tramp.
If you don’t please us, we’ll crucify you at the gate!”</p>

<p>The warriors began to stir, exchanged
glances, then started to approach in cautious short steps, their
spearheads aimed at Thomas’s chest. Thomas was slow to respond, and
Oleg (he stood by the wall) asked Burlan innocently, “The old gate
or the new one?”</p>

<p>Burlan did not seem to get it. A warrior
jumped up to him, whispered obsequiously in his ear. Burlan
started, stepped quickly to the window, looked outside for a while,
unable to believe his eyes, then went pallid, clutched the
windowsill with fingers of both hands. There were still faint
screams, shouts, a clang of steel coming from the yard. “What’s
wrong with our gate?” Burlan demanded in a constrained voice.</p>

<p>“Rotten through,” Oleg replied uncaringly. “A
blow and a spit reduced it to pieces. You’ll need a new one to
crucify a man on! Surely, times are hard…”</p>

<p>Thomas slapped on the table impatiently. “Sir
Burlan! I want back the cup that was stolen from me.
Immediately!”</p>

<p>The warriors along the walls exchanged
glances. Burlan turned away from the window. His voice was still
constrained, as though an invisible hand held his throat. “The cup
was left for me to store. I have no idea why so much fuss about it:
my chests are full of silver and golden cups, while this one is
plain copper. But I was asked to keep it in my place. Asked by a
noble man. And I will comply his request.”</p>

<p>“Where’s the cup?” Thomas demanded.</p>

<p>Burlan glanced over at the warriors who
crowded at the door, blocking it. He gave a malevolent smile, his
voice grew louder. “Right behind this wall. On the shelf near the
lamp. Take it if you can.”</p>

<p>The warriors gripped their swords, scowling
at two unarmed travelers from under their helmets pulled over their
brows. Behind them, some spearheads and spikes of helmets could be
seen.</p>

<p>Thomas started to rise, red with fury. Oleg
intruded quickly. “Your Grace, I have a lower rank… I’ll fetch
it!”</p>

<p>As he stood near the wall pointed by Burlan,
he bumped against it. There was a crash, deep cracks ran along the
wall, huge blocks thundered out. Oleg stepped after them, leaving a
cloud of dust in the breach.</p>

<p>Thomas gave a start but made himself stay at
the table and adopt an air of boredom. Burlan grew as white as
snow, his jaw dropped, his eyes goggled and glassy. Two of his
warriors dropped their spears and ran away, shrieking.</p>

<p>They heard shouts and clang on the other side
of the breach, then a hunched figure emerged there in the crimson
light of the fireplace. Oleg kicked aside a block of stone, as
large as a bull’s head, his sneeze raised a small cloud of dust. He
carried a copper cup, pressing it against his chest, shielding from
the rain of small stones with his palm. With a humble bow, he put
the cup in front of Thomas and bowed again. “Your Superiority,
that’s your chalice.”</p>

<p>Thomas touched the salient side of the cup,
greenish with age, with fingertips, said into the space, “What ways
in this pigsty! Aren’t you going to feed your humble guests? We are
not likely to have another feast soon.”</p>

<p>Oleg dusted off noisily, slapping clouds of
dust out of his rags. He heard a sad note in Thomas’s apparently
cheerful voice but said nothing: no one has ever come back from
another world to tell what foods are served there. Small stones
glittered in his hair. The block he had kicked away was lying on
the other side of the hall. Warriors glanced at it with fear:
hardly any of them could even move it.</p>

<p>Burlan turned his head with a screech. “Bring
food for these… pilgrims… guests,” he said in a hoarse voice.</p>

<p>Carefully, Oleg sat down on the bench near
Thomas. He moved slowly, like a clever horse among fragile dishes,
even felt the bench before sitting. Burlan stood by the window but
did not look outside anymore: his goggled eyes were glued to the
breach in the wall, through which a man riding a horse could
pass.</p>

<p>Oleg made an inviting gesture. “Sir lord…
Burlan or Burdan… or Buridan… would you mind having dinner with
us?”</p>

<p>Burlan gave a start, took his eyes with
effort off the gaping breach. Oleg waved at him welcomingly, and
Burlan came, in wooden steps, and sat down on the bench facing
Thomas. As their eyes met, the last blood rushed away from Burlan’s
face: the eyes of ragged knight errant shone like two stars of
Bethlehem, bright red roses flashed and faded on his cheeks.</p>

<p>Behind Thomas, there was a breach where men
rushed about, shouted, dragged someone from under the stones, then
carried him away. The fallen torches smoked on the floor. A servant
in a greasy, soiled apron came through the gap, stepping over huge
stone blocks that lay all around the hall. The tray quivered in his
hands. When he put it on the middle of the table, Thomas winced:
the meat was cold and the bread so hard that they could use it to
break another wall.</p>

<p>“A fast day, eh?” Oleg sympathized. “It
should be fish, grass…”</p>

<p>Thomas, who had just stuck his teeth into the
first slice of meat, recoiled. “Sir lay brother,” he said with
vexation, “all your reminders come either too early or too
late!”</p>

<p>The servant hurried to take the meat away.
Thomas followed him with hungry eyes.</p>

<p>Oleg cried after him, “Bring him fish! Fish!
I saw a big fish here – it scratched itself against the fence when
we passed… er… through the gate. Scratched and grunted!”</p>

<p>Burlan shifted his stunned gaze between
Thomas and Oleg. Both had very serious hungry faces.</p>

<p>Oleg sniffed. “A good host would have
something to wet our whistles,” he said with a jeer. “But you see,
sir abbe, these people are starving!”</p>

<p>Burlan blushed with insult and blurted out.
“I have five barrels of Cyprus wine in three halls from here! And
in my cellar, I have twelve barrels of madeira, Cahors wine, and
northern moonshine!”</p>

<p>“Thank you for information,” Oleg replied
politely.</p>

<p>Burlan had barely bit his tongue, as he
realized his mistake, when the strange vagrant bumped, like a blind
man, into the wall pointed by the master, broke through with a
terrible crash, made a breach from the ceiling to the floor. Huge
blocks, each would do to smash a bear, rained on his head and
shoulders, rolled down his back. He sneezed of dust and
vanished.</p>

<p>Burlan sat yellow like a dead man. Blue veins
twitched on the temples of his head, his face fell, his nose
sharpened. Soon there was some more thunder, an irritated roar,
crash of rolling stones, heavy steps, then a terrible crash and
thunder again, sounds of falling stones, frightened screams, a
plaintive cry.</p>

<p>Fresh roast meat was brought in. Thomas
gorged on it, as he suffered a beastly hunger. His fingers
scratched an empty tray before he knew it. The servants vanished.
At once, there was the “fish” that used to scratch itself against
the fence and grunt, and also the “fish” flapping its wings in the
reeds. Actually, Thomas could have real meat with no remorse: a
traveler may lose both the count of days and the calendar, but the
wonderer reminded of the fast inopportunely… Thomas’s hand stopped,
he felt a surge of fury. <emphasis>What if he was just teasing? A bloody
Pagan, he can hardly know fast days… Maybe he wanted more meat left
to him?</emphasis></p>

<p>He felt the empty tray again, glanced at the
servants with annoyance. They went rushing about faster, serving
roast swans, geese, ducks, quail, a roast boar, a couple of baked
turkeys with apples, some venison… When, finally, they brought some
crucians fished in the pond, Thomas waved that away sluggishly: he
was full up, and his friend would have to start from a roast bear
or, at least, an ox.</p>

<p>In times some thunder came into the hall,
broken with short periods of silence. As Thomas ate, he did not
listen much, but then felt a vague surprise. Burlan had said the
wine was just across three halls, hadn’t he? Then Oleg should have
broken through only three walls… Or four? But there was much more
crash, anyway. <emphasis>Could the poor wonderer get lost in this
labyrinth of the castle halls and passages, so unusual to a Pagan?
Now he walks around, breaking through walls, demolishing stairs and
passages, his breath choked with dust… And I, Thomas Malton, sit
here and pig out while my hungry friend roams a strange
castle?</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas spat the bones out onto the middle of
the table, started to rise, with strong intention to walk on the
distant noise (or walking in the opposite direction would do better
if the wonderer had gone far?), when a scary crack ran down the
opposite wall. There was a thunder, huge boulders crashed into the
hall, rolled about it, and the hunched figure of the wonderer
appeared in the breach. With a forty-basket barrel on his back, he
looked like Atlas.</p>

<p>The barrel’s edge got stuck in the gap. The
wonderer gave an angry roar, kicked out the protruding stones
below, elbowed away the boulder that bulged out on a level with his
shoulder. A big stone fell down on his foot, and the wonderer spoke
ill of Christ, the Virgin and her knight who sat gobbling and
snapping his jaws, instead of helping his friend in Christian way
before he sets to drinking in knightly way – gorging on…</p>

<p>Oleg tried to get through again. Thomas
yelled to warn him. “The barrel will break!”</p>

<p>His terrible shout made torches drop from the
walls and the helmet of the warrior who stood steadfastly in the
doorway fly away. Reluctantly, the wonderer set the barrel down on
the scattered stone blocks, went over all the possible pedigree of
the Virgin with own insets. <emphasis>Hell burn this Pagan!</emphasis> Roaring,
Oleg brought down all but the whole wall, grappled the barrel and
brought it to the table. The blocks of heavy stone had rolled about
the hall, one stopped at the very table. With joy, Thomas put his
foot on that stone and rested his elbow on the knee.</p>

<p>Carefully, Oleg put the barrel down near the
table, knocked out the bottom with a spat. The befuddling smell hit
their nostrils. Thomas gasped, grabbed the biggest scoop eagerly.
Burlan’s face showed despair.</p>

<p>Oleg looked at the lord and nodded. “I don’t
like the wine of Cyprus, it can’t be helped. I reached it, tasted…
‘No!’ I thought. I’ve always loved sweet things. The Cahors wine
would do! I went to get it but lost my way… I hope you had no
urgent need of those paintings stolen from Jerusalem? They were
ruined when those marble statues, stolen either in Mesopotamia or
Babylon, fell on them… They would not fall, but I slipped on the
spilled precious rose attar when I caught on those barrels by
accident – mistook them blindly for some wall design…”</p>

<p>Thomas drank much and enjoyed it. His head
was strangely light and empty. Sounds grew louder, then quietened
again. Even the hall seemed to narrow at one moment and broaden at
another, torches first went pale, then blazed up so bright that his
eyes screwed up at once. He reached for the meat, but his fingers
stretched for scores of feet and the plate turned out to be one the
other end of the table. He burst with drunken laughter, snatched a
big slice, almost dropped it down but caught in the air, sank his
teeth in it with a roar.</p>

<p>Only three warriors remained in the hall.
They clustered at the door, ready to rush away at every moment.
When Thomas dropped his meat, they exchanged glances, one backed
and ran downstairs on the sly. If the two strangers got drunk,
they’d smash the castle up like a doghouse. Either its walls were
made of sand or those two guests came from Hell for the lord’s
soul…</p>

<p>Oleg gobbled meat, washed it down with the
wine, scooping it. Burlan quivered, not daring to rise from the
table. He gestured to his servants to serve new courses as
frequently as possible, and the pilgrims gulped down piles of
hazel-hens, hocks of deer, fillets of beef, washing it all down
with waterfalls of wine. Thomas got red, his cheeks glistened, his
eyes roved. Suddenly he began to bowl the marching song of
Roncesvalles. Dishes began to dance, the ceiling rained thick dust
with small stones, and the third wall gave a dry crackle as a
winding crack ran down it, from the vault to the floor.</p>

<p>Thomas made an encouraging gesture to Burlan,
and the lord began to sing in a shaky voice. It sounded like an old
goat’s bleating. Thomas frowned: he recalled Burlan’s voice to be
different. Could the host be mocking at him? Could he mimic his
guests, which was simply inadmissible for any European, even
uneducated one, not to say anything of a civilized man whom a noble
knight of Christ’s army should be…</p>

<p>Just two warriors remained at the door:
backing, jerking their heads up in fright to look at the crackling
vault. Thomas got silent for a moment, taking a breath, and a
trample of feet running away came from the corridor. With ardor in
heart, Thomas sang about the last battle of Roland, in which he
slayed Saracen with his beloved sword, wishing no mercy of them. A
new, broader crack ran across the first one. Small stones rained
down.</p>

<p>Oleg clapped Thomas on the shoulder, pointed
at the crack, and stood up. “Thank you for your hospitality, lord.
That’s our way: everything for guests! But we mustn’t outstay our
welcome. Sir Thomas, take the cup. We must go.”</p>

<p>Pale Burlan managed to raise himself up his
feeble feet. His armor clang like dishes in a cart pulled by a
galloping horse along a forest road, over stumps and logs.</p>

<p>“And I want to paint the town red!” Thomas
declared stubbornly. “A death I’d love is to drown in a barrel of
wine!” He gave a loud hiccup, scooped some wine hastily and drained
it.</p>

<p>Oleg clapped on his shoulder. “Sir Thomas!”
he said in a warning tone. “The last time we painted the town red
we ruined all of it… That’s no good!”</p>

<p>“And here… hic!.. we r-r-r-ruin…” The scoop
in his hand got crumpled like a burdock leaf. Thomas threw it away
indignantly, groped about the table, felt the plate where the roast
boar had been very short time before.</p>

<p>“No good,” Oleg repeated with reproach. “That
time you were punished by forty bows and two days fasting without
wine and I, as a Pagan, was told to sacrifice to Peroun two sheep,
one goat and three Christians! If they tell me the same now, where
will I find sheep and goat in this place? Though it’s good with
Christians…”</p>

<p>He stared with dim eyes at the last brave
warrior who held the door steadfastly, though there were terrible
holes in both walls, each large enough for two men to ride through
in a row. And that warrior went pale, gave a sob. He seemed to be
blown away by wind. They heard only a fast tapping of heels, then a
door slammed below.</p>

<p>“And you,” Oleg went on persuading, “you’d
rather burn in hell than live two days without wine! Let’s go.”</p>

<p>As Thomas, in his tragic absent-mindedness,
thought over the wonderer’s words, he rolled the iron dish into a
pipe, smoothed it again carefully, like a crumpled parchment, and
rolled again. His eyes were dim. Oleg raised him by shoulders.
Thomas, in his last gleam of consciousness, grabbed the cup,
pressed against his breast with both hands.</p>

<p>Oleg turned to Burlan. “Tell them to drive up
quickly two remounts! With blankets and food for a week. And give
our clothes back to us. Do it quickly, or he’ll smash the place all
over!.. As he’s destroyed the Temple of Solomon, the Gardens of
Semiramis… and the Tower of Babylon – the second, smaller one…”</p>

<p>With his help, Thomas was clad in full
knight’s armor. Oleg hurried to lead the knight outdoors. The floor
was rocking like sea waves. Shadows darted ahead, some heads stuck
out and vanished. All the doors were wide open, neighs and
frightened screams coming from the yard.</p>

<p>Oleg led Thomas down the porch, embracing him
by waist. People bustled about in the dark night and red
torchlight, carried sacks and saddle bags. Two saddled horses were
jumping in fright of shouts and torches, trying to pull their reins
free. The bravest men took the risk of leading them up to the
porch.</p>

<p>Oleg helped Thomas into the saddle, tucked
the reins in his hand. Thomas went drowsy at once. In terror, Oleg
felt his own body getting heavier quickly. His legs seemed to turn
cast-iron, his mouth dry, his tongue scratched the throat. “Hail,”
he muttered, “ssssee us off not…”</p>

<p>Once mounted, he took the reins from Thomas’s
hand, drove the horses to the breach in a slow pace. The scattered
blocks had been removed but the gate still lay in the middle of the
yard. In the torchlight, smiths and carpenters tore iron cramps and
stripes off, dragged heavy logs away. As they saw the travelers who
had knocked out the gate coming gain, they dropped crowbars and ran
away.</p>

<p>Losing his strength quickly, Oleg glanced at
Thomas with fear. The knight reeled, then lay down on the horse’s
mane. In the breach, there was a clatter of axes and hammers. Oleg
thought sluggishly that the valiant knight and himself were too
weak to beat off sparrows.</p>

<p>Suddenly the clatter stopped abruptly, some
shadows darted away and vanished in the dark. Horses galloped out
briskly, as they sensed freedom, from under the stone vault into
the night. The cold air chilled them to the marrow. Oleg curled up,
feeling as though skinned. He took a firmer grip on the reins, as
heavy as soaked logs, with his fingers going numb, and used his
last strength to kick the horse with heels.</p>

<p>The road glimmered dimly in the ghastly
starlight: no moon. The earth looked scarily dark, only the tops of
knolls, stamps, and boulders were silvered a bit.</p>

<p>Giant trees dashed past, on both sides of the
road. Horses galloped on, as though along a narrow valley, the
faint starlight silvered the path a bit. The death cold was
creeping deeper into Oleg’s stiffened body, with all of its
vitality spent before, his heart beat slower and quieter. Finally,
trees came closer and branches intertwined overhead, screening the
sky off.</p>

<p>Horses stopped in complete darkness, blacker
than pitch or tar.</p>

<p>That was the last thing Oleg could
recall.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 31</p>

<p>In a strange dream, he saw himself lying on
the river bank. Waves lap in two steps from his head, a fish jumps
out to catch low-flying gnats. Watching that fat fish, he feels
desperate hunger: not for gnats but for silly fat fish.</p>

<p>He struggled his heavy eyelids up. He
<emphasis>is</emphasis> lying on the bank of a river, its waves lap in two steps.
The light is dim red, strangely diffused, the sky all covered with
low clouds.</p>

<p>Oleg felt his body with a sluggish surprise:
half-naked, ribs protruding like bones on a picked corpse, his
belly all but stuck to his back. His swollen tongue was scratching
against the palate, but once Oleg stirred, he felt a desperate
hunger. No thirst, though his mouth was dry, but hunger. He would
like a big fat fish.</p>

<p>He heard a moan nearby. Thomas lay there with
his eyes closed. He was emaciated, his eyes sunken, his cheeks
covered with two-week bristle. His gaunt body was naked to the
waist, bones protruding on his broad chest, ribs about to break
through the tightly stretched skin.</p>

<p>Oleg shook Thomas by shoulder. His own arm
was moving dead, Oleg felt surprised at its being so thin. The
knight heaved a sigh, his eyes opened. His look was perplexed, but
then his pale lips curved in a feeble smile. “Sir wonderer… I
thought we parted… As your place is in Hell, I’d have to sing alone
with harp in hands… But the Virgin remembers of men’s friendship,
so she placed us together…” He turned his head with effort, looked
with surprise at the strange reddish clouds that hung straight over
their heads.</p>

<p>Oleg sat up. He had a dull headache and saw
double. The water was purling in two steps, a big stream rather
than a river, but, strangely, Oleg could barely see the opposite
bank. Was something wrong with his eyes? He had never seen such
reddish dusk – or dawn? – before, though in his long life he’d been
to many corners of the wide world created by immortal Rod.</p>

<p>He heard a perplexed voice. “Is it Hell or
Heaven? If Heaven, then I should have a harp in hands, be seated on
a cloud and sing praises to the Almighty… Or the Lord knows I have
less ear for music than any bear in Britain and my voice makes
crows drop as they fly? And I’ve never played harp… I played dice,
thirty-one, twenty-one and vampire, I played joker but harp… er…
But if that’s Hell, where are those creatures with tails whom I saw
after every carouse that lasted more than a week?”</p>

<p>There was a quiet rumble overhead, then a
loud splash in the river. Oleg felt creepy all over with an
indistinct fear. His fingers found the necklace of charms, went
counting them convulsively.</p>

<p>“But what if Purgatory?” the knight continued
in a thoughtful voice. “A place neither for you nor for me?.. No
way for you to our Heaven. Neither for me, a devout Christian, to
your Pagan paradise, as your shameless orgies are forbidden to the
warriors of Christ… unless one was drunken or couldn’t control his
feelings, but then he should confess to the army chaplain. Our gods
could arrange it: to put both of us, lest separate us, into the
Purgatory. That’s a place between Heaven and Hell. Neither fish nor
flesh nor good red herring, as we put it. Not a thing, neither one
way nor the other…”</p>

<p>They heard steps. Oleg alerted. Thomas raised
a bit, peering into the reddish semi-dark, gave a moan of weakness
but kept his body rested on his arms, thin as splinters. Oleg
observed the reddish dusk as closely as he could. Some vague spots,
which could easily be taken for horned mugs or sharp-toothed jaws,
floated before his strained eyes. Thomas slapped on the bare
ground, groping for his sword, muttered a curse and bit his tongue
with caution: he did not know whether one was allowed to swear in
the purgatory or he would be transferred to hell for that. He had
no fear of the boiling tar but a fear to part with his true
friend.</p>

<p>A woman turned up from the semi-dark. There
was nothing a moment before, she seemed to emerge out of thin air:
slender and lither, with a paunchy jug in hands. Oleg smelled a
befuddling fragrance but kept his eyes on the woman, not the jug.
She was naked to the waist, with beautiful high bosoms, in a long
skirt. However, both friends were naked to the waist too.</p>

<p>“We are in the Mahometan paradise!” Thomas
whispered anxiously, but his eyes were glued on the beautiful
woman. “I have Saracen boots on, they could confuse…”</p>

<p>The young girl put the jug down between
Thomas and Oleg, took two silver cups off her belt. Her moves were
graceful, she kept smiling. Thomas blushed but couldn’t take his
eyes off her maidenly snow-white bosoms, with pointed teats that
seemed to be made of pink granite.</p>

<p>“Is it paradise?” Thomas asked in Saracen.
“Are you a houri? And where are the rest twenty thousand?”</p>

<p>She bared her pointed white teeth in a smile,
answered in a strange language, which Oleg hadn’t heard for ages
but, strangely, he could still understand it easily. He gave a
start of amazement, felt his back shivery. “Where are we?” he said
slowly, choosing the words of the Agathyrsian language with
effort.</p>

<p>The girl’s eyebrows flew up high, her eyes
opened as wide as they could. She backed, said hastily, “The elder
come and explain. And now you drink mountain mead.” Oleg felt
creepy with fear again, as he watched her vanish at once.</p>

<p>Thomas followed her with shiny eyes. “What a
jump!.. She did not expect anyone to know her language.”</p>

<p>Oleg tilted the jug carefully over the silver
cup. From the narrow mouth, a strange dark liquid streamed out,
with no splash. The smell was pungent. “She was right,” he
replied.</p>

<p>“But you…”</p>

<p>Oleg brought the cup to his lips, made a
cautious sip, listened to himself, drained the rest of the strange
mead with more confidence. It made his stomach heavier, his body
liven up, his heart beat with more force.</p>

<p>Thomas drank his part. “Mountain mead?” he
said with perplexity. “It feels like liquid meat… Sir wonderer, I
think we are in your Pagan hell!”</p>

<p>“Slavs have no hell,” Oleg reminded. “Hell
was invented by Christians.”</p>

<p>“Or your Pagan heaven. No difference. Our
Heaven is for fleshless souls, and here I feel a stitch, a thirst,
and other things… I’m sure we can fight here too and our wounds
will heal at midday.”</p>

<p>“That belongs to Valhalla,” Oleg explained
patiently. “The paradise of Scandinavians. Rus’ lies to the south
of them and to the north of Eastern Roman Empire…” He lay down,
satiety spread over his body, his eyelids became heavy, he couldn’t
help closing his eyes.</p>

<p>“Is Rus’ between Aleman and Pole?”</p>

<p>“Closer to Steppes… Sir knight, abandon your
vain hopes. We are in no hell, no paradise, not even purgatory. We
shall hear the godly music some other time.”</p>

<p>Thomas touched himself with amazement.
“That’s why I feel so alive!” he said with surprise. “But you
promised we’ll die!”</p>

<p>“Promises are like piecrust… I can’t fathom
myself what could hamper. Off chance it will come right…”</p>

<p>“That mysterious ‘off chance’ again!”</p>

<p>For the second time Oleg woke up with hunger
again. He saw a new jug, bigger and broad-mouthed one, on a flat
stone. Thomas was asleep, his arms outstretched, the reddish dusk
curled behind him. Clouds hung overhead. Oleg felt something wrong:
for the time it took him to have sleep out and get hungry, no cloud
had moved or changed its shape.</p>

<p>Some voices and laughter came from the left,
a crackle of coals, a smell of birch firewood. He heard horses
neigh nearby and a strange many-voiced echo repeat after them but,
as close as Oleg peered, he could see no people, no fire, no
horses. Feeling weak and ill, he struggled up, walked on the
voices. He staggered, the world before his eyes went dark in times,
in other times he saw a flash of reddish stars.</p>

<p>The fire was revealed suddenly, as though a
tent curtain was opened before Oleg. Some men and women are sitting
by the fire. Everyone is small, with broad shoulders and narrow
hips, their faces as white as mealworms. They have elaborate
clothes on, as though for a celebration, but sit on stones, lie on
the bare ground. Some thin slices of meat, separated from each
other with fragrant leaves, hang on willow twigs over the coals. As
fat drips down on the coals, bluish smoke flies up.</p>

<p>“Good day,” Oleg said in the language of
Agathyrsians. He stopped in three steps from the fire. “Or
evening?”</p>

<p>Young boys jumped up in haste, making room by
the fire for him. Oleg saw ghostly pallid faces with blue lips
turned to him from every side. Everyone had strangely big eyes, the
color of ripe acorns, that seemed goggled in surprise. They watched
him with astonishment. When Oleg sat down by the fire, the boy who
looked the eldest told him with caution, “We have eternal twilight
here, stranger.”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, his watchfulness and anxiety
still with him. He felt something strange about those people but
could not fathom what it was. His charms seemed to have run wild:
they stuck in fingers all at once. “Twilight… Why?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know? That’s strange… We are in
the lower world.”</p>

<p>Oleg took in their serious faces at a glance,
looked around. The lower world was what Slavic sorcerers called the
place for the souls of dead people. Ordinary people, not heroes.
<emphasis>Heroes, ascetics, and righteous men go to paradise, while the
rest get here.</emphasis> There was no lower world in the past, when the
souls of dead people stayed on earth to incarnate into animals,
birds, fish, even bugs and trees. <emphasis>So there used to be a soul
cycle.</emphasis> People could understand the tongues of animals and
birds, though with effort. Soon after, that common kinship was only
known to sorcerers, but the world remained integral – until gods
created paradise and the lower world… <emphasis>And far to the south, in
hot India where Arpoksai brought his tribe from the Upper Dnieper,
they still have neither paradise nor the lower world. The souls of
their dead still get into animals to return, after many
incarnations, into a human body again…</emphasis></p>

<p>“When did you die?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>People around the fire stiffened, goggled
their eyes at him. He felt something wrong again. “Die?” the eldest
one asked back.</p>

<p>“Die,” Oleg said again. “How else could you
get here?”</p>

<p>People exchanged glances. Finally, a
young-looking man with deathly pale face told him, also with great
caution, “Our forefathers came here. But they came alive… as we
are.”</p>

<p>Oleg felt his charms, glanced the strained
faces over quickly. The people also felt nervous, that gave him
some comfort. Thoughts darted about his head fervently, Oleg ran
over the options, threw some of them away. “We seem to have the
same name for different things,” he said at last.</p>

<p>Annoyed, he reminded himself that in the
times when Agathyrs led his tribe away from the banks of Dnieper,
after he had lost to Scyth the contest in drawing the bow of their
grandfather, there was still a soul circle. No need of the
underground world, so it did not exist. The need arose when humans
received the obligation to remain human even after death. To
achieve it, people started to bury their dead straightened. And if
the body was burnt, the pot to collect ashes was either made in the
shape of human figure or had a human face painted on it.
<emphasis>Agathyrs could not get into the lower world. It simply did not
exist then!</emphasis><emphasis><sup>19</sup></emphasis></p>

<p>“Does everyone know this world is
underground?” he asked.</p>

<p>They watched him closely. Shivering in his
soul, Oleg noticed all of them had sharp, penetrating eyes. Their
sights touched his mind like invisible delicate fingers, but Oleg
was used to keeping his thoughts and feelings hidden behind a solid
fence.</p>

<p>“You are smart,” the eldest one said. His
voice was flat, with no hint of feelings. “Very quick at it… No,
the tribe knows not. Many generations changed since the day when
Agathyrs led the last of his people into a deep cave to save them
from enemies who were coming upon… Only we, initiated sorcerers,
know the truth: we and our herds roam about great caves!”</p>

<p>Oleg did not falter. He felt tenacious eyes
on him. His brain worked quickly, thoughts replaced each other like
flames.</p>

<p>“Do you know the way out?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Now we do,” the eldest one replied. “But
that time the entrance collapsed behind Agathyrs and his people.
The earthquake all but ruined the tribe… Many died, the rest had
hard time. They explored the cave, using their torches, found a way
deep into, through a whole succession of colossal caves, some big
enough to house <emphasis>ten</emphasis> such tribes!.. They had to cross
underground rivers, round the lakes. Huge blind creatures lived in
their depth of those, white and huge like serpents…”</p>

<p>Oleg closed his eyes, listening to the dull
monotonous voice, and imagined all that terror when people ran out
of their torches on the third day, started to burn clothes and
broken fragments of carts. Then the wood was also over, leaving
them in creepy dark… It was pitch-dark when a big animal attacked
women, killed two and injured five. Men managed to kill it despite
the dark, though several of them were injured by swords and spears
in that terrible night battle. The tribe made lamps of the fat of
dead animal. Then they would kill other cave animals, eat their
meat, make bow strings of their sinews and lamps of their fat…</p>

<p>Many people died, unable to stand the life
without sun, but those who survived gave rise to a new tribe.
Agathyrs and his sons would always come ahead of the main party to
explore every crack, every way down. In the four hundredth year of
cave life, after many generations had changed, one of the walls
burst with a crash and opened a cave so large that others, which
saw the life and death of those generations, seemed small forest
glades as against it. In that cave, connected with some others, big
and small, strange grass grew, amazing animals lived, and some
blind fish never seen before splashed in lakes and rivers.</p>

<p>By that time, only Agathyrs and two of his
sons, one of whom was a sorcerer, remained of the eldest
generation. Others had long lives, several times as long as a
common man’s, but they had less sunny blood of gods in their veins,
so they got old and died… few of them, as the rest perished before,
in fierce fighting with cave monsters. Agathyrs dreamed of the
return above. He even prepared arms to revenge the offenders, but,
not long ago, he was also reached by doom: he perished in a
campaign, fighting the monster who attacked his party suddenly.
Agathyrs was the last living man of those who had seen the sun. His
sons were born underground, the two of them who still live are
decrepit old men…</p>

<p>“But how did we get here?” Oleg inquired
tensely. “If you saw no sun…”</p>

<p>“No sun, but surface,” the elder one replied.
“Every six hundred years, as entrusted by Agathyrs, two or three
men of the most initiated sorcerers make a long, exhausting way
above. They climb for two or three months. Once it took half a
year. Then we wait for a rainy night, when the night sky is covered
with clouds… Last time it were me, Taras and Nazar who made the
ascent. My name is Ostap. Straight out of the crevice, we found
you. We did not know people above can still gorge on the overcome
grass! In our tribe, even a child would not eat a blade more than
he needs, so we had no antidote with us, which is, definitely,
unforgivable for sorcerers. We should be ready for any case,
shouldn’t we?”</p>

<p>Oleg felt searching looks at him. “The
overcome grass is extinct above. They tell tales of it, but no one
knows what she looks like. I found it by chance…”</p>

<p>“But you knew it was overcome grass?”</p>

<p>“I knew but people had forgot. I’m a
sorcerer, so I know more than others.”</p>

<p>They ate meat in silence. Ostap told Oleg
there were big serpents in caves and beasts much bigger and scarier
than serpents: they would hunt serpents as wolves hunt hares, kill
and eat them. Also they hunted huge slow animals that looked like
turtles, but each one was the size of a hill, its bone plates as
thick as a log. When those animals fought, their roar rent the air,
made big stones fall from walls and the invisible sky, killing and
injuring people and cattle. Once Agathyrsians suffered very much of
those monsters, dying without number, until their warriors, under
the guidance of sorcerers and Agathyrs himself, made traps for the
beasts. Since that, people were safe, then started to press on the
monsters, bit by bit, winning new caves from them.</p>

<p>They heard steps. Thomas came out of the
thick air suddenly. As he saw Oleg, his face lit up, he gave a
polite bow to everyone around the fire. Ostap pointed at the place
near Oleg, gave the knight a twig with stringed slices of roast
meat.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t know our tongue,” Oleg explained.
“He’s from another tribe.” They looked with disbelief. Someone
tried to speak to the knight, Thomas made guilty smiles and
helpless gestures.</p>

<p>“He doesn’t understand,” Oleg said again.
“Out there, many things have changed. You came underground when the
world was young and all the tribes and nations spoke the same
tongue. Or almost the same… at least they could understand each
other. One pronounced ‘a’ where another said ‘o’, the third spoke
with a twang, but it was understandable. However, changes are fast
there above. The nations you left… no trace of them anymore! Even
their names are forgotten. Brave Agathyrs forged his swords in
vain. He would have found no one to revenge, no one to burn in a
slow fire, no one to skin…”</p>

<p>Oleg started to retell the conversation to
Thomas. The knight stopped him with a gesture: talk now and retell
later.</p>

<p>“Shall we see you tribe?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>Ostap looked aside. “If you are ready to stay
with us, you can do it now… But if you want to go back to the Upper
World, then it is up to the Council of Elder Sorcerers to decide.
If they decide to let you go, then you will see nothing… Every
tribe has its secrets. Please don’t take it as offense.”</p>

<p>“All our life is war,” Oleg told him sadly.
“When shall we see the Elders?”</p>

<p>“Life here is a slow stream,” Ostap replied.
“But you have good luck. The Council will meet in three days.”</p>

<p>Their life streamed, as far as Thomas got it,
with no division into day and night, in the eternal twilight. The
walls were inhabited by glowing moss, and luminous mold grew in
places, but that was a faint light even for accustomed eye. Human
sight could reach no farther than ten or twenty steps, that’s why
people seemed to appear out of thin air and vanish in it. But there
was a good side too: the invisibility of walls made the world look
endless.</p>

<p>As far as he understood, the earth is
cracking continuously, like a ball of clay in the hot sun: old
cracks get deeper and new ones emerge. The caves are huge, and new
ones are added. Once the nomads in their roaming came back to some
old caves after three thousand years and failed to recognize them:
the caves were three times that broad, their walls had long cracks
leading into strange spaces where invisible water splashed and
strange animals roared,</p>

<p>On the second day Thomas, looking around
suspiciously, whispered to Oleg. “Sir wonderer, it’s a bad place…
These people are wizards!”</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>“I managed to approach a wall… and there I
saw a thing that made my hair stand on end! An old man came out of
solid stone, walked a bit along a stream and, following it, went
into the stone wall again!”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t it have seemed to you?” Oleg asked
anxiously.</p>

<p>“I’m no fool, sir wonderer! I crossed myself
at once, then also said a prayer… as far as I could remember the
words. But the old man did not vanish. Moreover, I touched his
footprints on sand and I can stake my life that he’s no older than
forty-eight, a bit lame, has joints in his left leg aching…”</p>

<p>“I believe you!” Oleg interrupted hastily. “I
forgot how skillful warrior you are, sir knight. That makes a
difference… If <emphasis>this</emphasis> is the weapon Agathyrs prepared, they
can make dangerous enemies. And what if they have something
else?”</p>

<p>On the next day, Ostap came for them,
examined both critically and told to follow him. They went along
the wall. Oleg understood that the rest of the young sorcerers were
dispersed ahead on their way to prevent common people from seeing
the strangers. <emphasis>Let them live in happy ignorance of another
world.</emphasis></p>

<p>Ostap let the guests into a small cave and
stopped in the narrow entrance, blocking it. Three people in white
robes were waiting in. All had the same silvery-grey hair falling
on their shoulders, so it took Thomas some time to see that only
two of the old sorcerers were men, while the third was an ancient
crone. Her face, covered with small wrinkles like a baked apple,
was as colorless as the faces of all Agathyrsians. She had alert,
unfriendly eyes.</p>

<p>Two old men exchanged glances. One made the
guests a gesture to sit down. “My name is Boryan, this is my
brother Boris and my sister Borunia. We are children to Boreas and
grandchildren to Bor. We are the eldest sorcerers of the
tribe…”</p>

<p>“And where’s the son of Agathyrs?” Oleg
interrupted. “I’d like to see him. His name is Taurus, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p>The old men exchanged glances again. “How do
you know his name?” Borunia asked harshly.</p>

<p>Oleg paused, looked at the shimmering stones
in the walls of the cave. “Of all the sons of Agathyrs, Taurus was
the only thinker. The rest were warriors who despised him. They
only wanted to gallop across the steppes on fast horses, to chase a
deer or, which was even better, to clash face to face with enemies
in mortal combats…”</p>

<p>The crone watched him with disbelief. Boris
gave a cough. “Why do you need Taurus?” he asked with mistrust. “He
is too old to be disturbed. He is with the tribe, while we here are
only a vanguard.”</p>

<p>They looked with expectation. Thomas also
kept his eyes on the wonderer. Oleg smiled, lifted his hands. “I
would just love to see him. And I’m sure he will be glad to see
me!”</p>

<p>After a long pause, Boris said warily, “You
speak as Agathyrs spoke, as his sons spoke, as Taurus speaks still.
Now it is the sacred language of sorcerers. Our small folk, and our
princes too, speak differently. How do you know this tongue?”</p>

<p>Oleg grinned, pointed at Thomas with his
sight. “You could have guessed already.” He sounded almost
merry.</p>

<p>The three sorcerers gasped and goggled at
him.</p>

<p>Oleg waved his hand, his face darkened, his
voice turned sad. “You are right about not coming above. Blood runs
in rivers there. People kill each other so fiercely that the most
savage wolfs and hyenas look innocent lambs against them! Whole
tribes are butchered, with women and children. Nations fight
nations, tribes fight tribes, clans fight clans, families fight
families, brother fights brother. Even a single man fights himself
to the bitter end, as he’s lost the sight of Truth and
Falsehood!”</p>

<p>The three of them were silent, their eyes
attentive. The strangers had too much mystery in them, and
sorcerers are the ones able to watch and listen, while hasty
decisions belong to green youth.</p>

<p>“Probably,” Oleg told them very sadly, “gods
keep you here as seeds. People above may all destroy each other. It
seems more and more likely to occur. And then you will come out, to
populate the upper spaces with kind, peaceful people. You are far
cry from those beasts who have once run into these caves to escape
other beasts, even more savage…”</p>

<p>The crone squirmed with discontent. “We have
never been beasts!” she interrupted peevishly.</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head, his eyes full of
sympathy. “You <emphasis>have</emphasis>. What shame in that? You should be proud
of your having turned humans from beasts! Sadly, it’s usually other
way round… And you left childish pugnacity to children.”</p>

<p>He glanced slantwise at Thomas, and the three
sorcerers followed his sight. Thomas sat on a broken fragment of
rock. Arrogant and haughty, he looked solemnly over the heads of
elders. He was manly and handsome, a head taller than the sorcerers
and twice as broad in shoulders as any of them, his chest broad and
prominent, while his belly in bolster-like muscle as flat as a
bug’s.</p>

<p>Boris sighed, cast a reproachful look at
Oleg. “But you are not a pugnacious beast, are you?”</p>

<p>“I’m a sorcerer,” Oleg reminded. “But the
world is not all of sorcerers.”</p>

<p>They were silent for a while, immersed in
their thoughts. Oleg watched their clean mild faces with sorrow.
Since the Great Exodus, unknown to the tribe, there were no wars
against each other. Agathyrsians had conflicts and murders of
jealousy or envy but no bloody battles of two human parties. They
had too much of the exhausting war with underground monsters to
think about killing each other in addition. <emphasis>No place above for
their sort. Even sparrows will dominate them.</emphasis></p>

<p>Suddenly Boris flinched, as though woken up
rudely, asked hastily, “Do you want to return above?”</p>

<p>“I must,” Oleg replied sadly. “While one
plows, another has to fight. The world is still cruel.”</p>

<p>Boris looked aside at Borunia. She reared up,
her eyes blazed. “We cannot let you go! People above should not
know of our tribe. What if the cruel upper nations came rushing
here? Everything here will perish. You are right: we forgot war
long ago. Though we have some… But one cannot spend all their life
hiding. And we have no skill in killing people.”</p>

<p>Oleg alerted. Thomas reached, involuntarily,
for his absent bag. “People above are violent,” Oleg replied
carefully, thorough in his choice of words. “But no one will come
here. They are <emphasis>afraid</emphasis> of darkness, even as adults. Scared of
dark barns, of night forests… And they have no reason to come here
while there are many rich lands above! You are only rich with your
wisdom, but it’s not a thing to be carried away in bags. You have
none of what conquerors value.”</p>

<p>Thomas watched the senile sorcerers with
pity. <emphasis>All countries above are open to plunder. What madman would
go into these creepy caves instead, to rob beggars of copper
coins?</emphasis></p>

<p>The five of them sat in silence, even Thomas
made hardly a move. The cave’s air was thick and heavy. It made
Thomas feel relaxed and sleepy, like in the warm water.</p>

<p>Oleg kept an alert eye on the faces of
sorcerers. He handed his bag to Boris. “You are the eldest one
here, wise man. Please help me to crack this nut.”</p>

<p>“A nut?” Boris said in perplexity, without
touching the bag. “You have a copper cup there. It was forged seven
thousand years ago. As large as a fist, some Aramaic writing on its
lip, its stem a bit crumpled…”</p>

<p>With a sigh, Boris took the bag, felt the cup
through the thick fabric. Thomas watched him with great respect.
The elder listened, then his head jerked up, he cast a sharp look
in Oleg’s eyes. Oleg nodded. The old sorcerer, keeping an intent
eye on him, put his hand into the bag, found the cup by feeling,
and stiffened.</p>

<p>Boryan and Borunia glanced at their elder
brother with anxiety: his face was too strange. They also looked
sideways at fascinated Thomas who even rose a bit to look into the
bag.</p>

<p>“I feel strange power,” Boris spoke very
slowly. His face was otherworldly, as though his eyes reached far
behind the stone walls. “This cup contains great power… but I
cannot understand it.”</p>

<p>“How great?” Oleg asked tensely.</p>

<p>Boris still had a vacant look, his voice was
remote. “It is hard for a mortal man to judge. And we, though Great
Sorcerers, are just mortals… Taurus would have put it better. He
has the blood of gods… And Agathyrs the Immortal would have told
even more of it…”</p>

<p>Oleg heaved a sigh. Thomas shot a quick
glance in his dark face and understood that Agathyrs would have
said nothing too. And if Agathyrs even told it, he, Oleg the
wonderer, would have told the same before.</p>

<p>Suddenly Boris’s eyes opened wide. His hand
in the bag began to twitch, as though trying to clasp the cup
around. His eyes, full of infinite astonishment, were fixed on
Oleg. The wonderer gave a reluctant nod of agreement with something
important that the old sorcerer got to know due to the Holy Grail.
With the next nod, Oleg pointed at Thomas’s mighty figure, then
shook his head.</p>

<p>With obvious reluctance, Boris took his hand
out, handed the bag back to Oleg who, in turn, gave it to
Thomas.</p>

<p>“The Secret Seven, our mortal enemies,
started a real chase for this cup,” Oleg told Boris insistently.
“It is a miracle we still have it. But they have never come
themselves – only their servants! Why? What value they see in
it?”</p>

<p>Boris chewed his flabby colorless lips. “Why
won’t you look in the future yourself, the Wise?” he asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced askew at Thomas who was
adjusting the cup carefully in the depth of the bag, replied
hastily, “All the land we’ve crossed is enclosed with invisible
fence. In two score steps away from the cup, I still felt that
screen. And a longer distance away… Either no time for that, or too
dangerous. When I parted with the cup last time, I could allow no
look in the future – we were too busy saving our skins!”</p>

<p>Borunia, after being silent for a long while,
spoke in an angry, shrewish voice. “These caves are impenetrable to
the power of Secret Seven!”</p>

<p>In the face of Boryan, they could see anxious
doubt clearly.</p>

<p>“I don’t think they know anything of the
nation of Agathyrs,” Oleg comforted them, “the brother of Scyth.
When you come out in due time, it shall be a disaster to them!”</p>

<p>Thomas shifted his gaze between the sorcerers
and his friend. At last, he dared to break the silence with his
strong manly voice that clanged with steel, as though a huge hammer
beating on a cooling blade. “Is that prophecy about you?.. A mighty
nation come from the North… Gog and Magog… Is that you?”</p>

<p>They gave no reply, rigid and immersed in
something unknown to Thomas. <emphasis>Some mysterious thing retained by
ancient nations who had no bless of communion with the faith of
Christ.</emphasis></p>

<p>Ostap emerged near the cave entrance several
times, shot anxious glances. Nazar and Taras came and brought
pieces of strange meat, very fragrant. Thomas looked at it with
hungry eyes but refused firmly: one of the young sorcerers had
explained him before that it was the meat of frog animal, and
Thomas barely kept from vomiting. After that, during all three
days, he refused to eat the meat of frogs. No matter that those
cave frogs were as large as camels and attacked people.</p>

<p>A jug of mountain mead was put before Thomas.
They had dinner. Then Boris looked silently at his siblings, they
nodded sulkily in turn. The eldest sorcerer told the guests sadly,
“Our young will take you up there.”</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 32</p>

<p>They climbed up sheer walls, squeezed
themselves into narrow cracks, crawled by endless winding burrows,
scraping their sides and backs. Every time they fell, they were
caught by small but strong hands of young sorcerers. The third of
them, Nazar, carried the knight’s clanging armor in his bag and had
the hilts of huge swords, the bow and arrows jutting out strangely
over his shoulders.</p>

<p>Looking at the sorcerers, Thomas suspected
they could easily get above straight through the rocks if not the
need to pull their guests along. Once he even spotted, out of the
corner of his eye, that Ostap’s shoulder came in touch with the
protruding sharp stone edge but the young sorcerer proceeded with
no hint of stagger: as though it were no solid stone but a cloud of
smoke. Then Taras whispered something to him angrily, pointing at
Thomas and Oleg with his eyes. Tired Ostap gave his excuses. Thomas
pretended to see and hear nothing.</p>

<p>Long before the surface, they felt fresh
smells. The tinkles of water, which often crossed their way, were
growing colder until they turned icy cold. Smirking Oleg explained
stunned Thomas that the deeper into the earth is the warmer, so
Agathyrsians knew neither winter nor cold autumn for several
thousand years – it was always warm summer in their middle caves.
If one gets deeper, he’d have to walk across scorching deserts, on
hot stones. Deeper in, the walls are burning hot and the air as
boiling as within a stove. It smells of burning, with even more
torrid heat coming from below. <emphasis>Probably that’s where the Hell,
of which Christians tell so many terrible things, lies?</emphasis> Oleg
decided to find it out some time later. <emphasis>When there will be no
more dragons, giants, and stolen princesses on earth.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas glanced back. “We need to memorize the
way. Hell, you say?”</p>

<p>“Why would <emphasis>you</emphasis> need it?” Oleg was
surprised. “You have a place in heaven! On a cloud, with harp in
hands.”</p>

<p>“And you?” Thomas cried with insult. “How can
I sit on the cloud while you sit in a pot of boiling tar? May all
feathers on my wings burn, but I will come to rescue my sworn
brother!” He kept glancing back to memorize the way to Hell. His
face was solemn and tragic. He was already planning that journey in
his mind, checking his equipment.</p>

<p>They felt currents of air and, finally, saw
the light ahead. The sorcerers tied thick black cloths over their
faces but kept moving with confidence, with no touch to walls.
Thomas started screwing up, as he saw the breach ahead. They made
the last steps on their bellies, scratching their knees and
elbows.</p>

<p>Thomas gasped, as he saw the trees and old
stubs flooded with bright light. It was night, the scatter of
stones from where they came out was shielded by thick branches,
which whispered anxiously, but the dark sky seemed as bright as
day!</p>

<p>Ostap was the only one to come out on the
surface, while Taras and Nazar stayed in. Ostap tossed the bag down
on the ground, it gave a protesting tinkle. He hurried to take off
the sword baldrics, the bow, and the quiver. His voice sounded
muffled through the thick black cloth. “Even this light is too
bright for us!.. Eyes are watering. We leave. We adjure you again:
tell no one about us!”</p>

<p>Oleg embraced him. Thomas shook his hand and
assured, “Good sires, I’d never betray people who saved my
life!”</p>

<p>Standing in the crevice, Ostap raised his
hand in farewell and vanished. Oleg and Thomas stayed in the
shining night forest. Puffing with strain, Thomas climbed hastily
into his iron armor, clasped the steel plates on legs and arms. At
last, he put on his gauntlets, clenched and unclenched his fingers
happily. His steel fists looked menacing.</p>

<p>“No wink of sleep,” Oleg warned. He checked
his bow and went fingering his arrows critically. “It’s night. A
moonless one! May the sun not blind us when it comes out!” He
examined the trees thoroughly, squatted to touch the last year’s
leaves on the ground, the empty shells of acorns.</p>

<p>Suddenly Thomas clapped a hand to his
forehead. “Sir wonderer!.. We’ve spend much time there. I’m afraid
I’ll have to ride more than one horse to death to get on the bank
of Don by Saint Boromir’s Day!”</p>

<p>Oleg pecked at the earth silently, trying his
sword grip, then landed a test blow on a young tree. Being cut down
slantwise, it stuck into the dark ground near them, fell across the
glade, its branches rustling anxiously. “I’d like to know where we
are,” he said thoughtfully. “To see the stars at least…”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Thomas was surprised.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s not the place where they found
us,” Oleg explained politely. “I recall them carrying us…
Agathyrsians are nomads. They roam in their caves. Where have they
taken us for those two weeks we spent unconscious? That’s a
mystery!”</p>

<p>Thomas looked stunned. He sank down
helplessly on a rotten log. “<emphasis>What?</emphasis> They could have taken us
back?”</p>

<p>“In the morning we can find ourselves at the
walls of Jerusalem. Or in those ruins where Gorvel socked you on
head… Or even in China.”</p>

<p>“Where’s that?” Thomas inquired gloomily. His
eyes had an evil glitter.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” Oleg reminded, “they saved us
from inevitable death! Agathyrsians are the only people who still
remember how to heal such ‘grass-eaters’ as we. And being taken to
travel on their nomadic ways is a sign of trust.”</p>

<p>Thomas squirmed restlessly, kept standing up
and sitting down again. At last, he declared resolutely, “Sir
wonderer! We need to go, or I’ll burst with anxiety.”</p>

<p>“Which way?”</p>

<p>“Any. Just to get moving.”</p>

<p>“Then north,” Oleg decided. “Judging by these
trees, we are still in Europe.”</p>

<p>Thomas, with all his concern and fear to get
late to the bank of Don, noticed strange things about the forest.
It was solemn and silent, as all the animals and birds were
sleeping, and the faint light that came down through clouds and
branches was enough for his eyes, as they were accustomed to dark.
Thomas knew he would never see a night forest that way again: only
a dark place where one can make no step without bumping into a tree
or falling into a pit.</p>

<p>Long before the sunrise, their eyes started
to water with the dazzling light. The edge of the earth was only
lit a bit, the bright disk only about to come out, but the forest
looked flooded with liquid sun. Then everything went bloody red.
Thomas grasped that morning rays had set clouds on red fire. He
started to shield his eyes with palm. The wonderer, screwing up at
his side, comforted that Agathyrsians had led them out in dense
woods deliberately: the tent of thick branches would not let the
sunlight in. Moreover, the day promised to be dull, and later their
eyes would get accustomed.</p>

<p>Once they understood the light would not grew
any brighter, they took the risk of crossing a glade. The wonderer
fingered his charms anxiously, flinched often, hunched in fright.
Thomas glanced over, seized the sword hilt, but the forest was
strangely quiet. No birds squealing in their nests, though they
should be awake by that time.</p>

<p>“Hurry, Sir Thomas,” Oleg said nervously, all
of a sudden.</p>

<p>He almost ran deep into the truly wild wood.
Thomas stumbled over logs, got stuck in prickly shrubs, his head
hit against low thick branches. The wonderer seemed to be barging
into the very thickets deliberately, like a madman. He climbed over
the rows of logs, plunged under hanging trees, which were likely to
collapse of a careless blow, jumped over the pits of black water
that looked strangely still, like set tar. Thomas had his bag with
the cup and even his sword baldric stuck in the twigs continually.
As he ran, his head bumped against obstacles with such a force that
he saw stars flying out of either his iron helmet or his eyes.</p>

<p>“The forest is too strange!” Oleg said
nervously on the go, to explain his hurry. “I see no animal tracks,
hear no birds, no gnats…”</p>

<p>“I don’t miss gnats at all,” Thomas said
through gritted teeth.</p>

<p>“And no frogs…”</p>

<p>“Neither I miss frogs. Though they should be,
you are right… They are everywhere. They are said to live even in
Heaven: big green frogs…”</p>

<p>“Sorcerers say they also live in our
paradise. I didn’t see it with own eyes, but why should heaven be
better than paradise?”</p>

<p>Thomas gasped of that shameless blasphemy,
came running into a thick trunk and was thrown under a rotten log
that fell down on him with gloat, powdering his face with decay,
thick fat worms, sticking up his eyes with mold. Thomas grasped he
should not argue. <emphasis>This is ancient, Pagan forest, after all. And
frogs not always live in bogs: plenty of them inhabit woods and
grass. There also are small frogs dwelling on trees, jumping on
branches. And Heaven has beautiful green shrubs. Frogs can live in
them…</emphasis></p>

<p>Again, he got such a strike that made all his
steel ring. Oleg looked back gloomily but did not hurry up, his
eyes anxious. Thomas listened: the forest was absolutely silent, as
though it were winter night, not midsummer. <emphasis>However, even in
winter one can hear a clatter of claws on the wood, a caw of
crow.</emphasis></p>

<p>“I’m afraid we’ll know all of it soon,” Oleg
said slowly.</p>

<p>“And till that time we’ll get on without
gnats and frogs,” Thomas replied with a forced fun, as though he
had to cheer up his tired soldiers before the storm of Jerusalem.
“One should find good in everything, sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>For a long time, they forced their way
through thickets, then there were more glades on the way. Suddenly,
all shrubs vanished. Only dead black trees stuck out of the bare
ground. Few were covered with green moss, the rest were dry or
rotting slowly, dropping their heavy twigs. The ground was so dry
that it rang under their feet. The last year’s leaves had gone, and
the glades were crossed with deep clefts.</p>

<p>They came out in the broad field bounded by
the same black forest far ahead. Thomas alerted at once, put his
hand on the sword hilt. Ahead, there were huge white stones that
looked like picked skeletons of strange animals. The tallest ones
were almost at height with his shoulders. Those protruding blocks
seemed to have been sinking into the ground for the thickness of
ant’s feeler with each century. Judging by the smoothed edges of
stones, that had once been the roof of a high watchtower.</p>

<p>“A trouble,” Oleg said drearily. “As though
we had little of it before!”</p>

<p>Thomas lowered his visor, tugged his sword in
the sheath and turned into a position more convenient to draw it
out immediately. His eyes in narrow slit glimmered like blue ice,
his breath burst out quickly. The knight was not that light-hearted
as he pretended to be.</p>

<p>They passed the stone-studded field with
nothing to report, got deep into the forest again. Trees were giant
there, their green branches entangled very high above. When they
were deep in it, Thomas brightened up, pointed at a huge anthill.
Big red ants were dragging caterpillars, bugs, and grasshoppers to
it from everywhere. Soon after, they heard first birds, caught a
glimpse of red squirrel backs among the green branches. Thomas
sighed with relief, took his hand off the sword hilt.</p>

<p>Oleg, on the contrary, was frowning more and
more often, peering at the dark trunks, following squirrels with
intent anxious eyes. Suddenly he snatched the bow from his back,
put an arrow on.</p>

<p>There was a glimpse of marten on the branch
ahead. It ran over the road, lay down on the thick twig, arching
its back, and peered at the men. Oleg raised his bow slowly, aimed.
Thomas was sure the marten would flee, as it was in no more than
twenty steps from them, but the lithe animal only made a higher
arch of its back. Its eyes had a creepy sparkle of mica
crystals.</p>

<p>There was a dry click of bow string. Thomas
saw clearly that the sharp arrow hit the marten’s neck with force.
The animal lurched but only dug its sharp claws deeper into the
branch. Eyes blazed up like coals, jaws opened menacingly, showing
white fangs, too long for such a small creature. The rebounded
arrow shook several leaves off, fell down on the road ahead.</p>

<p>Thomas froze with fear, while the dark-faced
wonderer walked on, picked the arrow up silently. When they made
about hundred steps, Thomas glanced over in fright. The marten
still lay on the branch, its back a gracious arch, and followed
them with narrowed malicious eyes.</p>

<p>Suddenly Oleg raised his bow again, aimed
quickly, and shot. The marten bared its teeth, as the arrow hit on
its side. That time, the animal was thrown up. Its squealed with
fear, flew down, trying to catch at some leaves with sharp claws.
The quiver of branches marked its fall, but the marten did not fell
down on the ground: it seemed to vanish in the greenery.</p>

<p>Thomas said nothing, afraid that his manly
voice accustomed to giving commands and calling for storm may
quaver with fear.</p>

<p>They walked through the forest all the day
long, with three stops for rest, drained the jug of mountain mead
given to them for the road, ate the slices of roast meat. Thomas
turned his nose away from it at first, but the wonderer shot
nothing in the forest. When Thomas’s belly gave a rumbling protest,
he took the smallest slice reluctantly, started a conversation
about wonders, lest he see the filth he had to chew. He only came
to his senses at the end of the meal, after he finished the last
slice. The wonderer had stopped eating long before: he took the
iron head off his longest arrow and put a silver one, of a
flattened coin, instead.</p>

<p>By the coming of night, their eyes got
accustomed. Thomas said nothing against the fire, even fetched the
twigs for it. The wonderer, for some strange reason, came dragging
a stump, put his cloak on it, placed his boots filled with grass
nearby, and slipped into the dark silently. Thomas lay down on the
other side of the effigy, but his fear drove away his sleep. He did
not even dare to stir.</p>

<p>At midnight, Thomas heard heavy steps far
behind the trees. It seemed to be an oak walking to their fire
through green saplings. The knight screwed up, then dared to open
one eye a bit.</p>

<p>A giant figure, twice as tall as a man,
emerged in the circle of reddish light. The stranger was massive,
clad in black fur. His eyes on the hairy face had strange glitter,
and when he opened his mouth, as red as a burning stove, there was
a flash of pointed white teeth. “Take that for yesterday!”</p>

<p>With a terrible force, he brought his giant
club, made of a whole tree, on the cloaked stump. It cracked, sank
into the earth with a crash. Thomas lay quivering all over, but the
stranger paid no attention to him.</p>

<p>“Take <emphasis>that</emphasis> for today!” a malevolent
voice thundered suddenly in the dark.</p>

<p>The giant turned at it. In the reddish
firelight, there was a brief flash over the glade. The stranger
gave a sudden terrible roar of no threat but pain and fear: a white
feather was stuck in its chest, as the arrow had gone deep into</p>

<p>Thomas held his ears involuntarily, though
this move gave him out just before the stranger’s eyes. He couldn’t
bear hearing that scary roar full of deathly terror.</p>

<p>The giant dropped his club, reeling, his
monstrously broad hands gripped the injured place. The club, as
large as a log, rolled up to Thomas. The giant turned round,
staggered into the dark shrubs. The night hid him from sight at
once, but for a long time Thomas kept hearing his heavy uneven
steps. Trees shuddered, twigs cracked, then the earth was shaken
with a sudden heavy blow, as though a tree collapsed.</p>

<p>Oleg came out from the dark, draw a circle on
the ground around Thomas and himself, whispered and spat for a
while. “Why not you sleep?” he said with a jaw-rending yawn. “The
day was hard. Hope tomorrow is better. Get to sleep!” He lay down
by the fire, got snoring almost at once.</p>

<p>Thomas lay awake for a long time, flinched,
peered at the branches protruding from the dark. He heard squeaks
outside the lit circle, a clatter of small claws on wood. A bright
blue feather came down, swaying in the warmed air, like a boat in
the Golden Bay. Suddenly its edges blazed up with small flames, it
sank closer to the fire. A strong push of heat made it fly up and
vanish.</p>

<p>Thomas shivered, tucked his legs up when they
got too close to the border of light. He seemed to see hairy paws,
eager to grab him and drag deep into the woods… or even under the
roots of giant trees, into those dark gaping holes that breathed
out deathlike cold. Once there was a pat on his cheek. Thomas
jumped up with a mad shriek but the wonderer did not awake. It were
two small panting ants who carried a crumble of cave animal’s meat.
It was caught and stuck in times, but the brave insects kept
dragging it, fearlessly ignorant of giants, werewolves, and the
cowardly knight. Shamed Thomas sat up closer to the fire, pulled
his sword out and put on his knees. The wonderer slept with his
knees tucked up. <emphasis>A Pagan. Nothing matters to him.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>In a strange forest, someone must stay on
watch</emphasis>, Thomas told himself resolutely. <emphasis>The bravest warriors
are the first to guard the sleep of others, and we have just one
warrior here! The wonderer takes up arms only in case of need, as
though his real Truth can be obtained by unarmed man. And in such
an unpleasant place as this forest is, it’s better to have on watch
no plain warrior but a brave knight.</emphasis></p>

<p>The sword was shiny and, due to the
Agathyrsians, sharp enough to cut apart a single hair. Thomas,
unsure what other thing to take up, stripped off his shabby belt,
unpicked the worn-out lining and started to line a new one of the
boar skin, thick and sturdy. Sir wonderer kept pestering him with
his workshyness, while he, Thomas Malton of Gisland, a noble
knight, cared of his warhorse himself, cleaned and washed him.
<emphasis>Though it’s actually a job for squires and servants.</emphasis> In
their journey, Thomas was the one to gather brushwood for the wire,
fetch water from the river, boil the porridge, and often the one to
do cooking…</p>

<p>He heard the wonderer’s mocking voice behind:
a bit louder than it used to be and too resonant, as though Oleg
shouted from inside a hollow. “Whom the belt for?”</p>

<p>“The devil,” Thomas replied with a start. He
was annoyed with himself being frightened by that sudden voice, and
the question was stupid indeed: the wonderer had no need of new
belt, as his own one could endure a mountain or the forest giant’s
club hung on it.</p>

<p>He looked up and flinched. The wonderer was
asleep, rolled up into a ball, and the voice came from somewhere to
the left… Thomas turned hastily, caught a glimpse of huge green
back moving away, but the stranger vanished in the dark so swiftly
that Thomas could not be sure whether he saw him or that was just a
blow of night wind stirring the branches.</p>

<p>Starting at every rustle, he bent over the
belt, trying to keep his hand as close to the sword hilt as
possible. When it began to grew lighter over the trees, the
wonderer snuffled uneasily, crawled up to the fire in his sleep.
Thomas tossed the last twig into the fire: the air at dawn is the
coldest. As the wonderer felt the warmth, he moved away, without
waking up.</p>

<p>The twig burnt down. Thomas patted Oleg by
shoulder. “Sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>Oleg woke up, his clear green eyes looked at
Thomas in perplexity. He sat up at once, stretched himself sweetly,
which gave his bones a crunch, yawned with a creepy howl, like a
forest animal. “You are right, Sir Thomas. We must go! Have you
slept?”</p>

<p>“I was on the watch,” Thomas replied proudly,
nodded at the bare sword that was still across his knees, showed
the belt. “You see, I can do things myself.”</p>

<p>Oleg turned his head. “That’s a surprise, Sir
Thomas… If not your unhappy lot to be born a noble knight, you
could make a good tanner!”</p>

<p>Thomas forced a smile, but the next moment
the wonderer turned solemn, his hand seized the bow. Thomas heard
twigs crackle. A strange man came out from behind an oak (if that
was a man): a head taller than Oleg and Thomas, thrice as broad in
shoulders. All covered with grey-green bone plates, he looked like
an old, mossy giant lizard. “Good morn,” he roared menacingly.
“Give what thee swore!”</p>

<p>Oleg drew his bow. “Who are you?” he asked
quickly.</p>

<p>“Devil of woods!” the stranger bellowed in a
creepy thick voice. “Leave it. The arrow of thee no harm to my
skin. Even headed with silver!”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas said hastily, writhing
with embarrassment, “lower your arrow. He’s right… I promised the
belt to him.”</p>

<p>He hurled the belt, the green stranger caught
it deftly in the air. He was impossibly quick, like a nimble
lizard, but there seemed to be tight muscle under his thick bony
shell. He examined the belt carefully with his unblinking snake
eyes, pulled it, then tried to clasp around. Thomas had a secret
hope it would not fit: the master of night forest was thrice as
broad as the knight, but Thomas had made some spare holes during
his watch by the fire.</p>

<p>The devil sucked his scaly stomach in, pulled
the catch of the belt, and the pin got into the very last hole. The
devil puffed his belly up – the belt crunched but endured. The
devil burst with hoarse resonant laughter that sounded like stone
blocks rubbed against each other. “Good! I take it.” He turned
round and went away. Soon the snapping of twigs died down.</p>

<p>The wonderer followed him with astonished
eyes, as large as a surprised owl’s, his jaw dropped to the waist.
“What about your intolerance, faith in Christ, hate for infidels?..
Did your principles give a crack?”</p>

<p>Thomas replied angrily, as he found himself
in an awkward situation. “Sir wonderer, I will never give up my
principles! I simply can’t do that! But that toad of woods caught
me in a word, and the knightly word is all that matters. Even if
given to mortal enemy! Haven’t I concluded a truce with Saracen
relying on the word of honor only? I never broke it, neither did
they!”</p>

<p>Oleg took the bowstring off, put his bow into
the quiver of arrows, jumped up his feet. “We must go. Forgive me,
I was wrong. One should keep his word even with enemies. And then
he may see they are no enemies at all…”</p>

<p>They went through the forest. The light grew
even brighter, their eyes ached bitterly, but Oleg was glad they
could stand the light of the sun that was above trees. The next day
the direct sunlight would not blind them if they come in it.</p>

<p>“What forest is that?” Thomas asked. “Do you
know where we are?”</p>

<p>“The Dark Woods. The only good thing is that
no one would look for us here. Even the Secret Seven.”</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“No one has ever come out of it alive,” Oleg
comforted him. With disgust, he rounded a tangle of snakes
intertwined in their mating rite, went through the thickets: as
passionless and immersed in his thoughts of eternal verities as
Thomas knew him to be almost all the time.</p>

<p>It was hard to walk in woods without roads.
Thomas got tired soon, as he had to carry Burlan’s knightly armor
on while climbing the logs, which the wonderer could simply jump
over, and forcing his way through prickly thickets. The knight
started to think of having a rest when suddenly they heard a
crackle of twigs, shouts and screams ahead. The noise was coming on
them quickly. Thomas lowered his visor abruptly, his hand dropped
on the sword hilt.</p>

<p>The shrubs ahead opened like waves, a
snorting horse bustled out. A big man in the saddle, in rags of
hunting costume, was clinging convulsively at its mane, as the
reins had been torn away. Something was strange about his face.
Thomas did not get at once why it made him feel creepy all over. As
the rider dashed by, Thomas saw a smooth prominent surface in place
of his face, as though all its features were rubbed away by the
head wind, in the same way it rubs the sharp edges of rocks for
thousands of years, turning them into rounded boulders.</p>

<p>The rider darted past and across the glade.
Thomas felt an irrepressible fit of sickness. The rider had his
face on the back of head. That might have been an effect of the
head wind that kept blowing on him for the third century in row or
a part of his punishment: to see all the terror chasing him at
heels.</p>

<p>Some strange horrible animals, huge, shaggy,
and scaly, broke out of the shrubs onto the glade. Heavy blocks of
darkness, with only a glitter of sharp fangs, claws, thorns, and
combs, they rushed after the madly galloping horse, all but
snapping at its legs. The air was rent with roar, screech, barking,
a clatter of cloven hooves. All of them dashed across the glade,
then into bushes. For a while, there was a clatter of hooves, a
squeal dying away.</p>

<p>Thomas shrugged with a shiver, drew his sword
in with a thud. “I didn’t think they’d chase him that far!”</p>

<p>“Who was it?” Oleg asked with surprise. “You
know him?”</p>

<p>Thomas waved away carelessly. “The Wild
Hunter! He’s known to everyone.”</p>

<p>He walked on silently, sure that his
explanation was full. He even gave a start when Oleg said warily,
“Sir Thomas… Definitely, I realize what a trifle it is, known to
everyone on earth, even the sheiks of deserts, the children of
mountains and steppes, even to Burkinians, but you know I happened
to spend some time in woods… er… in the cave. I’m ashamed to
confess it but I’ve missed some events of world importance. The
Wild Hunter… who is he?”</p>

<p>Thomas gave the wonderer a surprised look.
The Agathyrsians called him Wise, once even the Wise, but if he
didn’t know such a famous event… er… “He was a highborn lord,”
Thomas explained patiently. “Had a beautiful wife, a healthy child,
a fine castle, and faithful vassals. But he had too much love for
hunting…”</p>

<p>“Many men have it.”</p>

<p>“But he, in excitement of it, would trample
down the crops of peasants, offend the weak. Once he even killed an
old man whom he bumped into while chasing a deer… For that, the
hunter was doomed to turn into prey himself and be chased forever
by a pack of demons. That’s how he keeps galloping for the third
century already. My grandsire told me of him.”</p>

<p>“Will his torments last long?” Oleg asked
with sympathy. “Punishments don’t last forever, do they?”</p>

<p>“The torments of sinners in Hell last
forever,” Thomas claimed adamantly.</p>

<p>“You have a cruel god,” Oleg reproached. “And
we Rodians have no hell at all.”</p>

<p>“That’s why you are so shameless! Each takes
two wives!”</p>

<p>“Not each, really. It does not befit some men
to have two wives, as they can take ten or twenty. Prince Vladimir,
for instance, had nine hundred wives and thousand concubines. And
he was the prince who brought your Christianity to our
Rus’.”<sup>20</sup></p>

<p>For a long time, Thomas walked silently,
confused by such a man as a guide in Christ’s faith, then said,
without much confidence, “Yes, that’s possible in your…”</p>

<p>“Why only ours? King Solomon had thousand
wives.”</p>

<p>“Then he is in Hell too,” Thomas declared
firmly. “All violators go to Hell!”</p>

<p>“Your god looks like a wild nomad to me,”
Oleg said. “He enjoys throwing live people into pots of boiling
tar, burning them with red-hot iron, skinning or stretching on the
rack…”</p>

<p>Thomas was crushing through the thickets
stubbornly. He even outran Oleg, to avoid discussing godly matters
with that Pagan. “I can’t get one thing… Are we already in
Britain?” he asked with concern.</p>

<p>“The Wild Hunter was Angle?”</p>

<p>“He was,” Thomas said through gritted teeth,
“but he could be a Scyth as well, couldn’t he? Or a Ross. You may
say one could gallop really far for three hundred years. But how
did he cross the sea?”</p>

<p>“What if he galloped by land?” Oleg supposed.
“Around?”</p>

<p>“Britain is all surrounded by water, sir
wonderer!.. However, he could come from Old Angles who stayed on
the continent while the rest of the tribe moved to British Isles.”
He fell silent, as he stopped near a big block of black basalt that
resembled a figure of sitting man. With good will, one could even
see his shield and sword.</p>

<p>Silently, Thomas unsheathed his sword,
saluted, flung it back into the scabbard with a thud. The knight’s
face was grim as a thundercloud, his eyes, blue like wild flowers,
went dark.</p>

<p>Oleg shifted his gaze to the knight. “Your
kin?”</p>

<p>“Garald,” Thomas replied significantly.</p>

<p>“Ah, just a familiar…”</p>

<p>“Garald,” Thomas said again in a raised
voice. He watched Oleg with some annoyance. “A great warrior!
Didn’t you in Ross hear of him?”</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t.”</p>

<p>“Holy Virgin! How do you live in this wide
world?”</p>

<p>“Getting by,” Oleg sighed hypocritically.
“Was he an Angle too?”</p>

<p>“Of pure Anglic blood! Once he led all of his
hosts to meet the enemy’s force that landed on our shore. That was
the greatest battle. The foes were utterly defeated, but the sons
of Garald, his brothers, and even his beloved old father perished
in that fighting. Garald was the only one who got no scratch,
though he fought ahead of his warriors… He felt so bitter while
walking across the endless field all covered with dead bodies that
he sat down on a stump, froze in his brooding, and then turned
stone!”</p>

<p>They walked, leaving the rock behind. “That
battle must have been long ago,”</p>

<p>Oleg said respectfully. “All corpses picked
by crows. But why did they fight in wild woods?”</p>

<p>“They fought in a field,” Thomas replied with
vexation. “The forest grew up later.”</p>

<p>Oleg cast a glance over the hundred-year-old
oaks they passed by, mighty and branchy, over innocent flowers and
poisonous grass that killed cattle and turned the soil barren. “I
can understand,” he said cautiously, “how the Wild Hunter could get
here and why the devil of woods spoke the Old Anglic dialect… But
Garald? Are you sure his battle took place in your new Anglandia?
In Britain, I mean?”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at him askew with a fiery eye,
like angry horse, waiting for a catch.</p>

<p>“However,” Oleg supposed, “if there was the
great migration of tribes and peoples that crushed the old empires
of Rome, then our gods, demons, spirits, and ghosts could also move
somewhere… The flow of time changes even the concepts of good and
evil! And our gods travel from country to country, from nation to
nation, change themselves on that way… I recall my amazement when I
encountered the Firebird of ours at the other end of the world, in
a country of strange people with dark brown skin!</p>

<p>“The Firebirds turned out to be native to
that land, have nests there, and ours was just a stupid one with
passion for far transmigration. It got acclimated in our country: a
fun to shine with its southern feathers at the snowy North…”</p>

<p>They were separated by a huge log, then
walked on both sides of a mighty oak. Thomas could not hear the
wonderer’s words but glanced at his side with interest. Suddenly
Oleg yelled, pointed with hand. In perplexity, Thomas turned his
head there – and his blood ran cold for a moment: a boar of
colossal size, with his head lowered menacingly, was rushing on
him!</p>

<p>He felt an acute regret that he had no lance
with him, raised his hand hastily to the sword hilt. The boar was
flying like a catapulted rock, his small red eyes blazed with
savage fury, scary glittering fangs were as large as elephant
tusks!</p>

<p>Thomas planted his feet wider apart, pulled
out the sword. The boar came down on him like a collapsing rock.
Thomas felt acute pain, struck forcefully against the hard
ground.</p>

<p>There was a menacing roar and cursing aside.
Thomas had time to turn on his side before a violent blow came on
his back. He flew up, breaking branches, saw the goggled eyes of a
squirrel and her young, turned in the air and fell down back on the
glade heavily, gave a howl of pain.</p>

<p>The wonderer was yelling in two steps. Thomas
turned with effort. He felt maimed and bleeding. A heavy carcass
fell down on him, splashing with hot blood, twitching and kicking,
his armor screeched. Then the carcass was moved away, he heard the
wonderer’s angry voice asking, “Are you alive?”</p>

<p>Thomas struggled a bit up on his elbow. The
boar lay in two steps, in a pool of blood. He was all but slashed
in two, with the second deep wound across his skull where the sword
broke it. “Thank you, sir wonderer,” Thomas said emotionally.</p>

<p>The wonderer stood over him, pale with rage,
the blooded sword shaking in hands, his eyes blazing with fury.
“Why stand on his way, you fool? No space to jump?”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Thomas said with dignity.
“The boar was running straight on me! If I jumped aside, wouldn’t
that be cowardly?”</p>

<p>The wonderer gasped with rage. “Cowardly?..
What a noble Angle!.. Do you really mind what a boar thinks of
you?”</p>

<p>Thomas thought for a while and admitted
reluctantly, “Truly I don’t. But the knightly traditions…”</p>

<p>With great effort, he struggled up. For a
long time they walked in silence: the wonderer was angry. Thomas
tried not to limp, endured the pain of bruises and abrasions. They
left the boar carcass behind: no need of meat yet. The wonderer
frowned more often, seized his bow.</p>

<p>That was how they went for almost half a day.
Gradually, the wonderer softened, started to give brief answers.
The knight felt guilty and spoke to him first. The wonderer started
to tell of the Dark Forest but stopped in the middle of a sentence.
Thomas saw blood rushing back from his face. Oleg turned all ears,
even stopped for a moment, then grew even paler and cried hoarsely,
“Get your butt in gear! Nothing to save us but our legs… And you,
fool, have them broken by boar!”</p>

<p>“Won’t <emphasis>this</emphasis> save?” Thomas asked,
clapping on the sword hilt.</p>

<p>“If only it could! I have the same piece of
iron on my back.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer! If legs were always the
rescue, hares would never die!”</p>

<p>Oleg rushed ahead, through shrubs and
wind-fallen trees, picking almost no way. Thomas clenched his
teeth, ran after him. The forest looked the same, Thomas could see
no danger but he’d made enough miles together with the wonderer to
trust in his charms and Pagan intuition.</p>

<p>The wonderer darted across the thickets, like
a loach. Sometimes he stirred no branch, as though he turned into
smoke or had learnt from Agathyrsians to pass through solid things,
while Thomas in his steel shell broke through, like a flying rock,
paying no hint to prickles and sharp twigs. Oleg often glanced over
while running, looked for the knight but Thomas hardly ever dropped
behind. In times Oleg got stuck in a tangle of branches but Thomas,
though heavier at his run, crushed any obstacle like an enraged
rhino. He left behind a broad trodden road covered with broken
young trees and branches, ruined anthills.</p>

<p>They were running for ages. For all that
time, Thomas heard not a single sound of pursuers, no howl of wolf
or other animal, no crackle of twig or small branch behind. Only
once a big shadow darted above, but the three floors of branches
made a solid screen between the sky and the ground, so that bird,
if any bird could be that large, should have seen not a damned
thing. When the shadow moved away to where they came running from,
Thomas seemed to see that the wonderer livened up a bit, stopped
hunching like a hare at sight of kite.</p>

<p>However, the wonderer kept yelling for him
not to stop, not to slow his run. The remainders of the mountain
mead were blown away, Thomas was flung from one trunk to another,
his mouth salty, his body screaming with pain. In addition, the dry
ground was replaced by a thick carpet of green moss. His feet kept
sinking into the wet champing layer and became as heavy as the
stones to tie ships to in a port.</p>

<p>The wonderer urged him on. Through the shroud
of muddy sweat, Thomas saw him nearby: Oleg gripped his shoulder,
dragged on, yelled, all but hitting him. Thomas dragged his feet
along. He wished nothing but to fall down and die in peace, without
even wiping the salty sweat off his forehead.</p>

<p>Suddenly his eyes were dazzled by a glaring
light. Exhausted, Thomas raised his head, stared in perplexity at
the huge dark trunks, especially dark and gloomy because of the
bright light shining behind them!</p>

<p>Oleg dragged Thomas up to the edge of the
Forest, pushed him forward. Thomas made several steps, squeezed
himself between the giant trunks that stood very close there, on
the border of Forest, to protect, like a knightly armor, the tender
inside of Woods from the scorching breath of endless Steppes.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 33</p>

<p>There was flat steppe ahead: no end to it,
not a single bush nor a tree – only low grass, tough and stunted,
that had won the struggle for life in the ruthless light of blazing
sun!</p>

<p>Thomas made a step out of the shade of trees,
reeled of the heavy torrid heat that came down on him. There were
some clouds, as white as lambs, in the blue sky, but they made no
obstacle for the scorching sun to burn the ground. At once, he got
nasty trickles of sweat running down under his armor.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced over at the Forest with fear.
“Let’s go… Forest animals can dart out on the edge.”</p>

<p>Obediently, Thomas limped away from the dark
wall of the Forest, though it did not seem that scary anymore.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” the wonderer said reluctantly,
“now I know precisely where we are.” His face was depressed.</p>

<p>Thomas got frightened. “Did Agathyrsians take
us back?”</p>

<p>“Just the opposite. But… they were going east
and let us out on the way. Now we are much closer to Rus’ than to
Britain.”</p>

<p>They walked in silence, Oleg kept his hasty
pace. Thomas, with his head aching, could hardly get the meaning of
his words. “We got closer to my Britain? Or farther from it?”</p>

<p>“Closer to Rus’,” Oleg replied evasively.</p>

<p>“So we’ll have to cross your Rus’? At last I
shall see which kingdoms it is clutched between!”</p>

<p>Oleg mended his pace. Thomas could not see
his face, wanted to ask more questions, but the enraged sun made
his armor red-hot, boiling him in own sweat so that he felt like a
crayfish in an iron pot. He dragged his feet along on dry yellow
grass, hoping he’d live till the halt.</p>

<p>When the wonderer cried the halt, Thomas fell
down, as though the ground was kicked from beneath his feet. After
a while, he turned onto his side, stretched his aching legs. As
Thomas had a look through the blades of grass, he gave a scream and
rose to his knees.</p>

<p>Far ahead, there was a bright gleaming wall…
or rather a rampart made of strange orange blocks. The sight of it
made Thomas’s heart beat faster. Oleg followed the knight’s look,
pointed in another direction indifferently. There was a similar
glittering circle of rampart. It could house a huge castle but
Thomas doubted whether it did: all he could see was the tall wall
sparkling in the sun.</p>

<p>Oleg gathered some grass blades, thick and
knotty, made a fire. Thomas looked with disgust at the two fat
lizards that the wonderer had killed by hurling stones. The
knight’s hunger made his stomach gripe, but that food was too
unchristian!</p>

<p>“Better a small bug than a hungry mug,” Oleg
comforted coolly. “Would you prefer to go without food?”</p>

<p>“Give me your frog.”</p>

<p>“No frog. That’s a small crocodile. Do you
recall the fare of Agathyrsians? Those were big crocodiles. It’s
all the same sort.”</p>

<p>Thomas ate the lizard up with its skin and
claws, then took a stone and waylaid two more stupid ones that came
out to bask in that mad torrid sun. He ate one of them raw, to show
the wonderer how indifferent the inspired warriors of Christ were
to carnivore joys. The wonderer also ate his one raw. <emphasis>To please
either his beastly Pagan habits or his beastly Pagan gods.</emphasis></p>

<p>“What land is it?” Thomas asked. He had
climbed out of his armor, stripped off, covered his body with
clothes to shield from the burning sun. The touch of light breeze
was blissful to his body: it was all red, like fresh-boiled meat,
with jets of overheated air rising over.</p>

<p>Oleg, with hands behind head, looked in the
sky. He had a dry grass blade in his teeth, a confused ladybird
crawling along it. “The beginning of Steppes.”</p>

<p>“Steppes… The Wild Field?”</p>

<p>Oleg turned his head a bit, looked sharply,
His voice was biting. “You got the skill to foresee?.. It
<emphasis>will</emphasis> be called the Wild Field, then the Ruin, but now it’s
just Steppes. A pool that keeps – for countless ages, a century
after century – splashing out strange nations without number,
savage, fierce, and blood-thirsty. They bring death, fire, and ruin
everywhere but build nothing. They only live by plunder…”</p>

<p>“Do they?” Thomas doubted. “They have herds,
after all. What would they do to the milk, meat, and skins?”</p>

<p>“They create no material culture,” Oleg
corrected himself. “Build no cities nor canals, plant no trees,
write no books. Should they take a city, they burn it, with all its
temples and libraries. They shatter beautiful statues but make none
of those. The few city dwellers who survive are taken for captives.
And we, Rus’, are the shield between Steppes and Europe!”</p>

<p>“Is your Rus’ against Steppes?”</p>

<p>“Yes. All our life is a struggle against
Steppes. A struggle of plowmen against nomads.”</p>

<p>“So… we are going to run into the steppe
dwellers?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We are about to enter the lands of
Polovtsians – the ones who press on Pechenegs who, in turn, have
come to Kiev. But the days of Pechenegs are over. They’ll be
crushed between the hammer and the anvil, and Ruses will have an
exhausting struggle against Polovtsians… I’m afraid we’ll see their
tents soon. But first the numberless herds of their horses…
However, first of all comes the swish of their arrows. Polovtsians
shoot before they ask any questions.”</p>

<p>Thomas raised his head a bit, looked around.
Within scores of miles, the steppes were empty save the strange
orange rings. Perching, Thomas saw two more of those gleaming
ramparts on the very brink of sight.</p>

<p>Oleg also raised his head. “Had enough rest?”
he inquired. “Then climb into your irons. We must go!”</p>

<p>Thomas moaned, crawling on the ground like a
squashed turtle. “I’ll memorize it for lifetime and entrust my
grandsons: to fear a Rus saying ‘off chance’, ‘and over’, or ‘we
must go’!”</p>

<p>They made no more than two score steps when
Thomas sniffed, glanced over at the wonderer with doubt. Oleg
nodded. In several more steps, the smell grew sharp, strangely
invigorating, like a sip of cold water in the heat. Oleg cast
attentive glances around. Suddenly he sank to his hands, rubbed his
belly against the ground, then turned and squirmed on his back.
Thomas goggled his eyes. The wonderer made an inviting gesture.
“Sir Thomas, please…”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“We came into the lands of a strange tribe.
They only know their kin by smell.”</p>

<p>“Like dogs?” Thomas asked with disbelief.
“Why should we care?”</p>

<p>“Dogs mark trees and stones on the borders of
their territory, Sir Thomas. For others to know them. A bear on his
borders would scratch trees, an elk would strike logs with hooves,
and this tribe does it the same way as dogs… You were right about
that.”</p>

<p>With disgust, Thomas rubbed himself on the
stones sprinkled with gleaming yellow drops. He was glad he had
armor on, unlike the wonderer. They moved on, across the steppes,
heading for northeast. Far and wide away, there was Rus’, the
civilized kingdoms beyond it, including Germany that was but a step
from Britain.</p>

<p>On the way, Oleg rubbed twice more on the
smelly rocks. Once he found some intact drops in a cavity, he
collected them accurately into a flask on his belt. Thomas wrinkled
his aristocratic nose but said nothing. During the laborious
Crusade, he had seen plenty of things, had been both high and
low!</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a rustle of grass in ten
steps, caught a glimpse of something. Oleg did not move an ear, his
sword remained on his back, along with the bow and feathered
arrows. Thomas relaxed his muscle, started to calm down, but his
heart kept pounding very fast, as though it felt a mortal
danger.</p>

<p>After two hundreds of steps, Thomas glimpsed,
out of the corner of his eye, a moving dark point on the left. Soon
he made out that was a killed deer carried by some strange animal
in jaws. The deer’s head and legs were dragged on the ground,
catching the grass. Once the branchy antlers got caught in a poor
bush. The animal yanked the deer up impatiently, it flew up with
the bush in antlers, of its white, shamelessly bared roots made a
flash in the sun. The animal seemed to be monstrously strong,
though three times smaller than the deer. Thomas shivered, started
to pull his sword out.</p>

<p>“Antes,” Oleg said without slowing down his
pace. “Never mind them. We are protected by spells.”</p>

<p>“Spells?”</p>

<p>“I mean the smell. Do you remember the stones
we rubbed on? Let me sprinkle some more on you.” Oleg sprinkled the
knight’s gleaming armor with big drops of sharp-smelling liquid,
aiming into the slits.</p>

<p>“Which antes?” Thomas asked, stunned. “I’ve
never seen…”</p>

<p>“Antes… are just antes. We Ruses are antes
too. This is how some foreigners call us, for we are numerous and
hard-working.”<sup>21</sup></p>

<p>Thomas opened his mouth to ask a new question
but remained still, his jaw dropped. The deer was dragged across
their way… by a giant ant! He looked like an ingot of black iron,
glittering in the sunlight, like a shiny knight, armored from the
end of his feeler to the least of his claws. His thick jaws were a
steel trap of two jaggy sickles, his prominent unblinking eyes
looking in a cold and hostile way, his iron legs moving so easily
as if he carried no prey at all!</p>

<p>He rushed by, in a score of steps ahead, left
an invisible jet of sharp invigorating smell. Thomas followed with
dumbfounded eyes the black body that dashed away on its six crooked
paws… to the sparkling rampart!</p>

<p>“The ants of Herodotus<sup>22</sup>.”
Thomas whispered in enchantment. “I thought ‘the father of history’
fibbed…”</p>

<p>“Fancy that,” Oleg said in surprise. “Have
you read Herodotus?”</p>

<p>“They’ll tear us to pieces,” Thomas whispered
again. “Our swords… what are they against their armor?”</p>

<p>“Off chance they won’t. What does Herodotus
say of it?”</p>

<p>“My tutor was retelling it to me. I can’t
recall all of it.”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, if we did not run onto this
field, we’d have scattered the forest edge with our picked bones!
The Dark Forest is not likely to let its prey go that easy.”</p>

<p>Behind them, there was a whole procession of
huge ants: as large as wolves, but clad in the most durable armor,
with not a smallest slit to stab a dagger into. They were running
in wolfish way: one by another, each next one touching his
predecessor with long supple feelers. Some jerked their antennae up
as they ran, felt the air. The ants paid no heed to Thomas and
Oleg. <emphasis>But if we retreat, we’d have to fight our way through this
live chain.</emphasis> Thomas recalled that even the smallest ants in the
lands around his castle would kill ruthlessly the bugs hundred
times that large, tear them into pieces, and drag into their
anthill to feed their gluttonous posterity.</p>

<p>“Go on, Sir Thomas,” Oleg said, but Thomas
heard no confidence in his voice. The wonderer looked so strained
as he’d never been before, flinched often. “The smell of the liquid
ants use to mark their ways will protect us.”</p>

<p>“What if it won’t?”</p>

<p>“Better die of their jaws than of foe’s
hand.”</p>

<p>“That’s right,” Thomas agreed with a heavy
sigh. “Animals are innocent and foes will rejoice… Let them not
have it!”</p>

<p>The wonderful rampart was growing with every
step. As a small child, Thomas had seen such rings on trodden
paths, after rain. The rings were made of white sand, very
distinctive against the dark ground: ants were taking the sand out
from the depth of earth to rampart their holes, protect against
something or somebody.</p>

<p>The black knightly beasts, in which Thomas
did not dare to recognize ants, were coming towards them more and
more often. Only by miracle none of them bumped into the men.
Suddenly Thomas saw a well-fed badger who climbed heavily out of
its dark hollow nearby, scratched its fat belly, trotted across the
field. A huge ant was running to intercept it. He was five times
that large, with his monstrous sickles of jaws apart. The badger
looked soft, unprotected. The colossal jaws should have cut it in
two at once, with no effort at all.</p>

<p>The ant came onto the badger, like a black
wind, his metal antennae touched it on the go. The animal squatted
and froze. Paying no more heed to him, the ant dashed away. The
badger gave a snort of discontent, trotted along the same way,
sniffing the puny shoots that stuck out of the dry ground.</p>

<p>“Badgers… have magic?” Thomas whispered in
fear.</p>

<p>“Hardly they have,” Oleg replied
indifferently. “Antes may treat them as pretty birds or fishes. Or
badgers may be sacred animals protected by ant gods… I don’t know,
Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>The yellow wall was growing/ Thomas noticed
some branchy trees with thick trunks. The closest were sticking out
of the gleaming rampart itself, the middle row was shaken with
mighty blows of huge golden blocks that often came rolling down
from the wall. Only the third row of trees remained intact. In the
forestless steppes, they only grew there, around the gold-yellow
rampart. Thomas suspected ants had brought selected acorns from the
far Forest on purpose.</p>

<p>Oleg started to turn, lest they come straight
into the wall, dazzling in the sunlight. In times, black knights
emerged on the top of it, with big gleaming boulders in mandibles.
Some of them frowned at the strange creatures, moved their long
metal antennae, while others simply unclenched their jaws to let
the boulders roll down, jumping on the unevenness. Some stones got
stuck. Freshly washed by underground water, they had a special
bright glitter.</p>

<p>One boulder rushed down, jumping, until it
rolled into a young oak, which Thomas and Oleg were passing by. The
blow made the oak shake, sprinkle sap out of the scratch.</p>

<p>The sun was sinking slowly to the horizon.
The top of the wall blazed with unbearably bright red-orange light.
Thomas turned his head anxiously, tried to increase his pace. “No
time to leave?” he said in fear.</p>

<p>“We’ll spend the night here,” Oleg
agreed.</p>

<p>“With these monsters all around?”</p>

<p>“Would you prefer a way back? The Forest is
still close… And the lands of this tribe are in three or four days’
journey around.”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back anxiously at the colossal
rampart, along which they were walking, jumped away from the
boulder that rolled straight on him. “Well, let’s go. We must go,
as you Ruses put it. Off chance it will come right!” Oleg was
silent and concentrated.</p>

<p>They walked until the sun was under the
skyline and the dusk came onto the steppes. With no arrangement,
they started to pick up dry branches on the go. Once they had
armfuls of those, they halted. At last, Oleg could use his bow:
whether the animals were sacred or not, the travelers vowed no
fidelity to the ant god. As a sign of respect, they would sacrifice
bones and limbs to him. And also feathers if their prey is a
bird.</p>

<p>When the fire blazed up, Thomas clayed the
killed monitor lizard and two skinny ducks that had dared to fly
over their heads, put them into the coals, sprinkled with hot ashes
all over. “Now we have protection!.. Fire is fire. No animal comes
near it. Even antes. They are no men, after all… Are they?”</p>

<p>“Who knows.” Oleg shrugged. “I heard
different opinions on it. I only know antes were created by gods
long before humans. Antes lived for millions of years but did
something wrong or displeased… Other sorcerers say they failed to
fulfill some great plan of gods… I don’t know, really. I explored
other things.”</p>

<p>“Is there a sorcerer who explores ants?”</p>

<p>“There is. More than one. Antes are a strange
nation: very ancient, very mysterious. They have their own world,
own rites and ways. As long as you follow them, no trouble… By the
way, these spells are driven out over time. Renew them!”</p>

<p>Reluctantly, Thomas sprinkled himself,
shaking out the last drops. Oleg rubbed the odorous liquid into his
bare arms, moistened his hair with it. The smell of ants made a
pleasant mix with the odor of roast meat from the fire.</p>

<p>The sky was going dark slowly, as well as the
ground, only the distant ramparts still shone with coarse-grained
whiteness. Thomas alerted at every rustle behind, every move of
shadows. His hand clapped on the sword hilt involuntarily. Ants
rushed by trodden ways, and Oleg, as Thomas noticed, had selected a
place far from the trampled paths. Ants dragged dry tree trunks in
their jaws, carried animals and even birds, others had jaws empty
but bellies almost dragging along. Oleg explained obligingly that
was the ants’ way to transport mead and water.</p>

<p>Oleg took the kettle. He went to where the
ants with swollen bellies were running and soon came back with the
kettle full of cold spring water. The fire was lighting a small
spot. Beyond it, there was darkness, full of scary rustle and
moving clots of black. Thomas shrieked when a huge cast head, which
looked like an anvil, emerged from the dark suddenly. The supple
feelers reached Thomas and started to move, feeling the jets of
warmed air. Thomas turned stone when the antennae crawled, with a
metal screech, on his armor, touched his legs and chest.
Fortunately, the ant caught his visor, it fell down with a clang,
screening Thomas’s face from the world. When the ant started to
examine the head of strange creature, Thomas just closed his eyes
and stopped breathing.</p>

<p>The ant felt Thomas thoroughly. In times he
had doubts and started feeling again, once even grasped by hand
with jaws. With utmost clarity, Thomas realized that if the ant
moves them a bit closer, his armor would crack like the quail egg
shell!</p>

<p>Once he dashed away, Thomas breathed out
noisily, raised his visor with trembling fingers. “A dragon will be
a smaller fright to me!”</p>

<p>“Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” Oleg
warned. “We have to cross the mountains that have more dragons than
bats. Dragons are only good in their sleep! And if a dragon is
awake… and hungry… And they are almost always hungry…”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer, can’t we take another
road?”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you late for your Krizhina?.. By the
way, that ant was very angry.”</p>

<p>“You know their tongue?” Thomas was
surprised.</p>

<p>“Only a bit of it,” Oleg comforted. “Just the
smallest bit!”</p>

<p>They heard a trample of many hard dry legs in
the dark, resonant clicks of sharp claws on the stone.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped up. “Away from fire! Fast!” he
urged, then splashed the rest of water out of their small kettle,
ran away after Thomas. Half a dozen big ants came from the dark.
Thomas made a move to return for his sword, which lay glittering
near the fire, but Oleg seized him by shoulders and held.</p>

<p>One of the ants all but came running into the
fire, wheeled round at once, a strong jet of water gushed out of
his swollen belly. They felt a poignant smell of formic acid. Coals
hissed, a cloud of steam flew up. Other ants surrounded the fire,
turned their bellies to it – some only raised on their forelegs,
their bellies tucked up – and spurted at the dying fire from all
around. The coals burst with hissing, faded. A cloud of sharp smell
went spreading in all directions,</p>

<p>When the ants left, after having put the fire
out, Oleg picked up the kettle, which was half full of formic acid,
packed the bag and went into the night. The steppes were only lit
by stars and the waning moon. Thomas took the swords and the bow
with arrows, hurried after the wonderer who knew the language of
black ants, though only the smallest bit of it.</p>

<p>Oleg made a fire again, a smaller one. Thomas
jumped up. “Will they come?”</p>

<p>“We got far enough… I hope.”</p>

<p>“Keep the fire smaller,” Thomas begged. “I
don’t like anyone looking over my head! Even if their genealogy is
hundred times as long as mine!”</p>

<p>The kettle emitted a strong sharp smell. Oleg
caught Thomas’s look at it, said comfortingly, “Now we have enough
spray for a week! I hope we’ll get out of here before.”</p>

<p>“A spray for ants…” Thomas muttered
unhappily. “And for dragons?”</p>

<p>“No spray will do for dragons,” Oleg agreed
with great sympathy.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at the smelling kettle with
disgust. “What are we to cook in?”</p>

<p>“We’ll pour it into the cup,” Oleg suggested.
He met the knight’s perplexed eyes and explained, “The one you have
in your bag. Holy Grail, that’s it.”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed crimson with noble
indignation. “Sir wonderer, how <emphasis>can</emphasis> you!.. That’s a shrine!
A relic! Even a wild Pagan should feel…”</p>

<p>Oleg interrupted, raised both palms as a sign
of defeat. “Let’s cook in your helmet then. Agree?”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer…”</p>

<p>“Is it hole-ridden?”</p>

<p>“No. But it’s a knight’s helmet!”</p>

<p>“Then let’s pour the formic acid there,” Oleg
resolved. “As the kettle is made for boiling fish soup in.”</p>

<p>Thomas twitched with protest. “That smell
will cling to my helmet for lifetime! No, we’d rather use it for
cooking. Lancelot once boiled fish in his helmet, Sir Gawain made
porridge in it, and Percival…”</p>

<p>“And Arey, the god of war,” Oleg interrupted
with delight, “once could not go to war because a dove had made a
nest in his helmet and laid her eggs. Ares had to wait until her
nestlings hatched and learnt to fly! No wars on earth for all that
time…”</p>

<p>“Bloody bird!” Thomas swore with indignation.
“To deprive noble knights of their feats? That’s disgusting.” He
leaned back, going to lie down, elbowed a big orange stone aside.
Suddenly his eyes opened wide, he hastened to roll the boulder
close, lifted it with effort on his knees, whispered in a suddenly
hoarse voice. “I swear on blood… of Christ that is the filthy
lucre! Was Herodotus right even about such trifles? I’ll read all
of it as soon as I’m back!”</p>

<p>Oleg kept indifferent silence. Thomas spat on
the stone, rubbed it with gauntlet. The yellow glitter grew
brighter. Excited, he squatted up, started to break the rock: it
turned out to be made of dozens of smaller stones, more than a half
of which were bars of heavy porous gold.</p>

<p>“Pick with your sword,” Oleg gave a sullen
advise. “Ants have sticky saliva… a deadly grip!”</p>

<p>“Saliva?”</p>

<p>“Or sniffles. No, that’s rather saliva, I
think. In their depth of earth, they stick small pebbles together
while digging their tunnels, lest they have to carry each grain
above separately. Though there are lazy ones who carry stones one
by one or even run empty.”</p>

<p>He lay down, tucked his knees up and fell
asleep at once, indifferent to anything that ants could drag out of
the depth of earth. However, all the night long he kept hearing in
his sleep some puffing sounds, heavy sighs, scuffing, dull
pounding. The knight struck with his fists, elbows. Sometimes Oleg
seemed to hear Thomas hitting with his head, even flinging himself
on the sword hilt to break apart the blocks of gold stuck
together.</p>

<p>All the night Oleg was escaping the thunder.
He dreamed of a ferocious battle of gods: Pang shook the earth,
Targitai set him in a plow, Peroun hurled thunderbolts. When at
dawn he opened his eyes, shivering with cold, Thomas was still
breaking huge stone blocks, like a slave in stone quarry. On his
right, there was a hill of waste, tall enough for a horse to hide
behind, on his left – a bright shining pile of gold nuggets, each
no smaller than a fist. The pile of gold reached to the knight’s
waist. Behind Thomas, there was a scatter of just broken stones,
with big nuggets still covered with clots of earth.</p>

<p>Astonished, Oleg turned to the glittering
rampart. Anxious, fussy ants were stopping up a breach wide enough
to drag the Trojan horse into. One by one, they ran onto the top of
the wall, dropped the porous blocks still smelling of underground
into the gap.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back vacantly, followed the
wonderer’s eyes. Suddenly, he moaned, shook his fists in dismal.
The new blocks used by ants to close the breach had twice that much
gold nuggets in them! The first rays of sun fell on the top on the
rampart, giving the gold its teasing glitter: it was so clean,
washed, and bright!</p>

<p>“Ants dig deeply,” Oleg explained patiently.
“Even small ones make their holes two or three sazhens<sup>23</sup>
deep and these big ones can dig in three or four versts! All sorts
of things can be found there, unavailable to man…”</p>

<p>Thomas watched the glaring rampart with
grievous doggish eyes, his Adam’s apple twitched, as he gulped the
saliva of hunger. That miracle was to stand in steppes up to the
autumn, then ruined by winter snowstorms, razed to the ground. The
spring would drown the heavy gold in muddy floods, the summer
powder it with dust. <emphasis>No one will find the treasure then, unless
by a random dig and until he gets too deep into the earth.</emphasis> “How
often they come out?”</p>

<p>“Once they did it every summer,” Oleg replied
after he thought for a while. “Old men say so… Then much less
frequently. Now these ants are said to come above once in a
century. They must have dug themselves too deep! There will come a
time when they will get completely hidden from our world: sinister
as you call it.”</p>

<p>Thomas ignored his attack. “Will all the gold
stay there?” he cried in anxiety.</p>

<p>Oleg smiled sadly. “How can ants know what
gold is? As they dig, they take up everything that blocks the way:
sand, rocks, ore, gold, bones of unknown animals… Hey, aren’t you
afraid anymore?”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced askew at the breach, waved his
hand. “Dazzled by the glitter of gold.”</p>

<p>“At night?”</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of glitter to retain in full
dark, sir wonderer! I saw how a noble knight killed another one,
also a crusader, whom he was releasing the Holy Sepulcher with, for
a single stone like these!”</p>

<p>Oleg got up, packed his things, checked
arrows: someone had scattered them at night. There were many tracks
of clawed paws around. He found his sword in two score steps, with
holes made by spiky jaws on the baldric. Suddenly he went pale,
clapped on his chest fussily, as though catching a grasshopper,
turned his pockets inside out hastily, slapped his chest again. His
eyes became glassy.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 34</p>

<p>Feeling something wrong, Thomas asked
anxiously, “What? What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“I forgot to sprinkle charms… Ants took
them!”</p>

<p>Thomas sighed with sympathy, made a helpless
gesture. “You slept like a log. You’d hardly wake up if they took
<emphasis>you</emphasis>… I caught a glimpse of some ant feeling you but I
thought you were exchanging some news. As you know their language a
bit! <emphasis>And</emphasis> I was busy… Don’t miss a woman – God will give a
wench!”</p>

<p>“What wench?” Oleg asked in perplexity.</p>

<p>“You can make other charms. I can lend you my
sword for it.”</p>

<p>“No, thanks.”</p>

<p>“Did you sanctify them in Jordan?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>

<p>“What’s the matter then? The same wood makes
icon and spade. I can fetch you the knottiest branch.”</p>

<p>Oleg glanced in the knight’s sympathetic
face, shook his head. “Ready to leave your gold?.. I did not expect
that. Thank you. Alas, I have no time to make new ones. If even I
had, I’d have to get used to new charms. To learn from own
mistakes… And now even the smallest mistake can cost our
lives.”</p>

<p>He scooped the formic acid from the kettle,
sprinkled his hair with it, rubbed it into arms and legs. Thomas
goggled his eyes. “What?.. What you want, mad man?”</p>

<p>Oleg grinned sadly. “You guessed right. We’ll
have to go into the burrow.”</p>

<p>Thomas jumped up, as though he sat on a
poisonous snake. “To ants?!”</p>

<p>“It were no badgers who took them. Don’t
worry, their holes are wide enough for me to get in.” He belted
with the sword, clasped tightly.</p>

<p>Dumbfounded, Thomas watched him adjust the
bow and quiver on his back, sprinkle them with formic acid. “Do
you… mean it?” The knight was shaking with indignation.</p>

<p>“Certainly I do.”</p>

<p>Thomas spat, picked up his sword, spoke in
rage. “Let no foe say I left my friend, even when he went mad… This
heat can really melt any brain. Lead the way, sir wonderer!” He
poured the rest of formic acid on himself, screwed up of the
poignant smell, tossed the cattle away uncaringly.</p>

<p>“Why throwing the kettle away?” Oleg
reproached. “What will you cook in?”</p>

<p>“Going to get out alive?” Thomas wondered.
“What mad off-chancers live in Rus’!”</p>

<p>“The main thing is to save your soul. And the
body may be eaten.”</p>

<p>“Body does not matter,” Thomas agreed. “A
knight consists of honor, glory, valor, and fidelity to his
Lady!”</p>

<p>Oleg started to climb up quickly, resting his
feet on gold bars. Thomas groaned as he saw the wonderer trampling
roughly on the pure gold. Aside, there was a glaring flash of
rainbow-colored sparkles, as though a sunray refracted by a block
of Venetian glass. Thomas gasped, squatted helplessly. Among
basalt, granite and golden nuggets, there was a diamond of the very
first water, the size of a fist! Oleg glanced back with discontent,
sighed and, having climbed over the top of the rampart silently,
started down the inner side.</p>

<p>Thomas felt struggle inside, but his best
friend vanished below, so he had to leave the diamond and other
sparkling gems. He gave himself a strong vow to come back sometime
and kick them all out from the ants’ rampart. <emphasis>Sapphires suit
Krizhina very much, and emeralds will fit her little niece.</emphasis></p>

<p>After the wonderer, he climbed down on the
flat trampled ground. Neither a pebble nor a grass blade:
everything smoothed and cleaned. The air was impregnated with a
strong smell of formic acid. Black ants rush about swiftly, like
knights on tourney, colliding in the same way, their armor cracks,
but ants run on as though nothing happened. Despite the early hour,
some were carrying killed animals. Over the northern side of the
rampart, there suddenly came dozens of big ants, each with a saiga,
still or feebly fluttering, in jaws: they must have encountered a
big herd. Attracted by the exciting smell, scores of ants darted
out a huge wide well and rushed swiftly to meet them.</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg came to the dark gap, felt
the cold and dampness of grave from there. Some ants, as black as
sin, emerged from the dark. They had big stones, still glistening
from the ant saliva used to stick together sand, rocks, and gold
nuggets, in jaws. An ant carrying a saiga darted past Thomas, all
but knocked him down into the well, crossed the brim deftly, and
dashed down with a clatter of claws, like a squirrel on a tree.</p>

<p>“Each has six paws,” Thomas said in a shaky
voice, “All hooked!” Oleg, with no word, sat down on the brim of
the shaft, turned, and started his descent. Thomas crossed himself
and followed his friend. “May you protect me, Our Lady! Though you
have a baby to look after – and babies need a constant eye! – may
you look at me, your true knight, in times! If I survive, I will
bring on your altar some gold from that pile above.”</p>

<p>He climbed down hastily, clinging to ledges,
ready to fall down into the fathomless well at every moment. His
fingers got numb under the weight of iron armor, sweat poured over
his eyes. He seemed to have fallen long ago if not his fear to
knock down the wonderer who was climbing below. The clawed legs
rustled around, as ants darted by, like massive anvils with iron
rods instead of legs, and vanished in the coal-black shade that
crossed the well slantwise. Thomas did not dare to shake the biting
drops of sweat off his face. A rock flew by, all but threw Thomas
down. He listened, but the boulder disappeared in the shadow
silently: neither a thud nor a splash nor a squeak there below.</p>

<p>The wonderer vanished in the dark. Thomas
felt creepy, hurried up. Fortunately, ants never bothered to smooth
the walls of their well, so there were enough ledges and hollows to
rest hands and feet on. When he plunged into the shade himself, he
saw a bifurcating tunnel in the wall. Surely, the wonderer picked
up the worst way.</p>

<p>He was descending for a long while. Probably
he would have to crawl down to the very bottom and get on the
turtle’s back – some say the Earth stands on three whales or even
elephants – but ants must have grown tired of digging straight or
they may have mistaken, black fools, but soon Thomas got sliding
down a steep slope, sometimes clinging to protruding stones: they
were glued in too tightly to be torn out. <emphasis>If the builders of the
Tower of David had ants helping them, crusaders would have never
destroyed its walls.</emphasis> Thomas admitted that honestly, as one
should be unbiased even to enemies. <emphasis>After they are defeated, of
course.</emphasis></p>

<p>The long tunnel was going straight gradually.
They were still descending, but Thomas took his hands off the wall:
his iron gauntlet slid as though on a mirror! The ant saliva
mortared the walls like the strongest glue, some stones protrude,
stick out, but no way to take them out, only break a half and only
if the stone is not wetted with saliva all over. On his go, Thomas
tried to pick them with the point of sword, but it left no scratch
on the smooth surface.</p>

<p>Moreover, the saliva shone: not so bright as
torches but brighter than the moss that gave light to Agathyrsians.
However, if ants were many million years older than people, they
had enough time to invent some better lightning. People definitely
should have done it in their place… <emphasis>No, ants can’t be that old.
God created Man only eight thousand years ago and Man was first,
while all sorts of animals and insects followed!</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas stumbled out of the blue, as he
suddenly recalled the vague hints by Agathyrsians and even that
demon whom he slayed valiantly in Constantinople – hints of his
wonderer friend’s having lived very long, almost eight thousand
years, and each Christian knows firmly the only one to live eight
thousand years on earth was the Devil, as God created him on the
First Day, while separating the Light from the Dark…</p>

<p>Oleg glanced over impatiently. “Sir Thomas,
wake up!”</p>

<p>“I just dreamed,” Thomas grumbled. “About the
high.” He struggled to take himself in hands, though he had no wish
to have filth in them and he felt really filthy after he dared to
think those vile things about the man who had not only saved his
life more than once – that was nothing! – but also had taken the
cup with Christ’s blood in hands more than once, which was allowed
to no sinner and should have make Satan burn or at least burnt…</p>

<p>He kept bumping into Oleg’s back, hitting
against protruding stones.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back in vexation. “Sir Thomas!”
he said angrily. “It’s not the place to sleep on the go! What if we
were in search of your cup?”</p>

<p>Thomas made himself rouse. “But that’s the
cup,” he muttered.</p>

<p>“And those are charms! They are no less
important to me. At least now.”</p>

<p>Roused, Thomas found himself in a creepy
underground passage faced with shining glass. It was sloping
downwards and crossed by other holes, full of scary darting
shadows, a resonant clatter of claws, a strong smell of formic
acid. Thomas grasped that his valiant knightly soul had plunged
into deep reflections, so unusual to it, to avoid seeing all that
horror: terrible monsters darting past him and his friend, who
seemed more and more strange and dangerous, while all of them were
in godforsaken hellish depth of earth!</p>

<p>The wonderer would always pick the broadest
hole, though they could walk along narrow ones too if they bent,
and the way downwards. It seemed to Thomas he also preferred the
tunnels with the strongest reek of ants. They waded across a stream
that ran out from one wall into the other. For a long while, they
walked knee-deep in icy water, clean as crystal and bouncing on the
glassy floor. Ants came running to it, always from the same side,
took the water in quickly. Astonished and admiring, Thomas caught
the glimpse of an ant pressing to the stream: his jaws went into
the water, his mouth opened, he started lapping like a big thirsty
dog, absorbing the water with force through a thick tube that went
into his dry belly. The black rings moved apart, started to slide
off each other. As his stomach was filling, a thin unprotected film
showed between the rings. Thomas noticed that professionally like
an ant’s weak spot but that would only do to injure water carriers:
ant soldiers would hardly march into battle with such paunches.</p>

<p>Ants with swollen bellies ran away into the
dark, while Thomas followed the wonderer into even more fear:
deeper and deeper, where it smelled stronger than any havoc of
anthill. Even ants they met there were strange. Above, all of their
kin were the same: wiry, sun-tempered, black, fast, and evil. The
ants below moved slowly – Thomas was kicked down only twice – had a
smaller size and even smelled a bit different.</p>

<p>The tunnel suddenly led into a small cave,
with three dark gaping holes on a level with the floor. Near one of
them, there were two ants, bigger than any ones Thomas ever saw
even on the surface, their long antennae moving. His heart was
wrung with fear: the wonderer headed for that hole!</p>

<p>Thomas followed his friend trembling and
clinging close to him. As the ants saw them, they raised on all the
six legs that glittered like metal. They had a menacing air. Sharp
jaws moved apart, Thomas saw clearly the small shimmering teeth.
Antennae and feelers explored the air, reached for the newcomers,
but the ants made no move to come closer: watchful guards to the
passage. “May we come back?” Thomas whispered. “Or into those other
holes…”</p>

<p>“They are abandoned or empty,” Oleg replied
without looking there. “And we need storerooms.”</p>

<p>Supple feelers darted to Oleg from both
sides, started feeling, touching, pushing. The wonderer patted
those thick antennae with hard brushes on ends, squeezed himself up
to the entrance at once, cast a quick glance back, and Thomas saw
his whitened face. He rushed after Oleg. There was a screech on his
armor, but he broke through, as though it were a wall of shields,
spears, and swords, uttered his battle cry habitually, gripped the
sword hilt on the go, draw the blade out by half – and found
himself running after the wonderer on the glassy floor, inside a
broad pipe with no end to it seen.</p>

<p>Oleg jumped aside in time, should any monster
attack him, as it looked to Thomas, and the monster, with menacing
jaws apart, rushed on. Thomas, with his heart pounding in panics,
grasped lately that ants were simply running on their own business.
Should one knock Thomas and Oleg down, that meant nothing: they
often bumped into each other as well, so the crash of bony armors
was heard constantly.</p>

<p>“They let you in?” he cried to Oleg’s
back.</p>

<p>“By smell,” Oleg answered without looking
back. “And also by secret sign I gave them.”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his hair rising on ends. “How…
you know?”</p>

<p>“I’ve spotted it,” Oleg blurted impatiently.
“While you admired the beauty of this place!”</p>

<p>Thomas blushed with shame so bitterly that
felt his ears prickling, as though in a frosty wind: he, a man of
war, overlooked the watchword of sentinels, while a man of
religion, though a profoundly false one, spotted all of it and
interpreted correctly! <emphasis>There seem to be some good things about
Paganism too. Not everything of it should be swept away, as
cautious thinkers suggest. We may take some things from the
past…</emphasis></p>

<p>“We’re getting close,” Oleg said suddenly.
“Take a hold of yourself, Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>“A hold?” Thomas whispered in terror. “Are
there more horrors ahead?”</p>

<p>They entered a cave that reeked of decay.
Thomas held his nose, mended his pace, even left Oleg behind. There
were white picked bones by the wall. Thomas caught a glimpse of
them and turned away at once, quivering, his forehead almost hit
against the wall that suddenly leapt out on him. He did not think
the world ever had animals of such size!</p>

<p>When they came, by a broad passage, into the
next cave, Thomas stiffened, unable to move. “Go along the wall,”
Oleg advised comfortingly. “Pretend you are going to no church but
tavern!”</p>

<p>In the dim light, strange and ghostly, as
though cast by invisible moon, there was a slowly moving great dark
mass of a two-headed hill, cracking and crunching heavily. As
Thomas looked closer, he discerned pale legs, as long as tree
trunks, with jaggy shins, then thick bony shells and combs. There
was constant crash, as though a monstrous stone breaker was
reducing huge blocks to road metal.</p>

<p>Oleg went along the wall carefully, avoiding
the giant legs that scratched, twitched, tried to drag the headless
bodies, many with their bellies torn out, their ovipositors pulled
away. Most of the underground monsters were dead, but the half-dead
ones demonstrated creepy vitality: still tried to crawl, climb,
their hooked legs got hold of their neighbors.</p>

<p>“The monsters of underground?” Thomas asked
in a thin voice that made him hate himself. “If these ones are
here, I can imagine what things live in the very depth!”</p>

<p>“In the very depth… er… a giant turtle on
which the earth stands. Or those are elephants? Or whales…”</p>

<p>“No, not <emphasis>that</emphasis> deep,” Thomas protested.
“Why digging through? I don’t think even these ants of Herodotus
could do it…”</p>

<p>“Do you think they could dig down to the hell
then?”</p>

<p>Thomas got convulsed, as he imagined the
tunnel they walked by leading them straight into the cave with hot
blazing fires, huge pots of boiling tar heating over, poor sinners
sitting in them and screaming terribly… He’d rather not get there
as that would be a predicament. <emphasis>The knightly codex says to help
the offended, but those are sinners. Even the Holy Virgin does
nothing to protect them, and I can’t be holier than she is…</emphasis></p>

<p>Keeping his head busy with godly thought and
whispering prayers, he squeezed himself after the wonderer into a
cave so large that the previous one looked a doghouse against it.
All the colossal space was covered with giant corpses of strange
underground monsters, whitish and hairless. Their skin looked
disgustingly soft, but their heads were terrible: armored with bony
shells fitted tightly, with only a narrow slit for eyes protected
with a lowering thick plate, a huge mouth wide enough to swallow a
horse…</p>

<p>Thomas wondered in fear why only the head was
protected while the heart could be speared easily. It was seen
through the translucent skin: huge, still pulsing feebly,
vulnerable!</p>

<p>“Diggers of holes,” Oleg said suddenly, as
though he read Thomas’s thoughts. “Head goes first and body’s
dragged after, squeezing in the narrow passage. That’s why they are
so soft, shapeless… And you are a brave knight! Even in this place
you think own thoughts.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas began, flattered by
the praise, “can those Secret Seven have a hand in the theft of
your charms?”</p>

<p>Oleg walked silent for a long time. Finally,
he shook his head. “Hardly they can. Ants do not obey them. All
men, either secret or overt, are the same to ants. It appears to me
that Secret Seven lost our track… We vanished too suddenly when
picked by Agathyrsians!”</p>

<p>“And then Agathyrsians took us on the face of
earth far away,” Thomas muttered. “If they search the place we
vanished at, combing through hills and dales, hamlets and villages,
we will leave unspotted: I for Britain, you for the Rus’ of
Herodotus…”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” Oleg replied, but he did not
sound confident.</p>

<p>A forceful push on thigh sent Thomas flying
with thunder into a corner. Moaning, he got up, shook his fist
after the ant running away. Once he rose, he was kicked down by
another ant who carried a huge angular block in his jaws – or
mandibles, as the wonderer kept calling them. Thomas followed the
offender with eyes, howled of double vexation: the saliva-glued
block was all but whole formed by sapphires. <emphasis>The smallest one is
as large as a fist!</emphasis></p>

<p>“Be patient,” a distant voice told him.
“We’ll be there soon.”</p>

<p>“Do you know where charms are?”</p>

<p>“How can I?” Oleg sounded surprised. “We’ll
have to rummage their storerooms!”</p>

<p>“Rummage…” Thomas moaned. “A needle in a
haystack! You should have made your horses, dragons and other
animals life-sized…”</p>

<p>He dragged along with his last strength,
groaning, trying to keep in sight the broad back crossed with the
long sword and the bow with quivers. The wonderer increased his
pace, all but vanishing from sight, waited impatiently, then dashed
along like mad again, extremely happy with his having no iron armor
on. Once Thomas came up with him, saw the wonderer’s bare arms
bleeding and covered with scratches and bruises: marks of his
collisions with ants, so armor was no useless burden at all!</p>

<p>Thomas quickened his steps, bumped into Oleg.
<emphasis>If he says</emphasis>, the knight thought nervously, <emphasis>we are walking
in the mouth of a colossal animal – either sleeping or long dead or
turned stone – I shan’t be surprised. I’ll only thank Our Lady for
the beast sleeping as long as possible. And once he rouses, let him
and ants kill each other in a struggle for power in the underground
world and the last ant die of malice…</emphasis></p>

<p>They came into a broad cave with walls of red
quartz. Ants had only stuck the cracks in them with their saliva:
just a glimmer of light, but their eyes got completely accustomed
by that time – Thomas was the first to notice huge chests along the
wall. He gasped, his sight ran along the row, counted forty of
them, large and larger. Each chest had an ancient symbol on its lid
and sides: a big <emphasis>svarga</emphasis>, carved either in wood or metal.
Thomas had seen the likes of it in his native land, left by the
first settlers on the coast rocks. They say those signs once had
been everywhere but the first missionaries of Christianity were the
ones to destroy them zealously: burn clothes with the image of
<emphasis>svarga</emphasis>, shatter jugs with it, trim it away from walls and
shutters. And those chests, judging by huge signs on the most
prominent places, must have been left by ancient people! Old
legends say they were extremely powerful…</p>

<p>Oleg jerked his head with irritation, passed
along the whole row quickly. Thomas hobbled after him, moaning.
“Sir wonderer!” he begged in a shaky voice near the last chest.
“Just a look in!”</p>

<p>“Locked,” Oleg barked out without slowing his
pace. “I don’t think ants could put charms there and lock!”</p>

<p>“We’ll find charms!” Thomas assured ardently.
“But I’m so fascinated to see what the ancients put there! Just
with half an eye!”</p>

<p>Oleg stopped near the last chest: the
smallest one, it did not reach even to Thomas’s belt. The massive
lid was so close that not a single hair could pass into the slit,
and the thick cramps were joined reliably with a paunchy padlock.
Thomas turned it in excitement, got sweated and, finally, begged in
despair, “I know holy pilgrims are taught none of such things, but
you are a Pagan pilgrim…”</p>

<p>Oleg took a grass blade out of his pocket,
smoothed it carefully, tucked into the dark keyhole. There was a
click, the cramp suddenly got longer, hung released in the hinges,
while the heavy padlock fell down on Thomas’s foot. The knight gave
a shriek of pain and surprise, goggled his eyes. “How you did
it?”</p>

<p>“Not me,” Oleg muttered. “Breaking grass!
It’s Pagan.”</p>

<p>Thomas hesitated whether to accept help from
Pagan magic potion for just a moment until his hands, as though
they had own will, gripped the lid, his feet took a firmer stand,
and the bronze slab was lifted with no screech.</p>

<p>Thomas rose on tiptoe, the orange reflection
from inside the chest fell on his face. The knight’s eyes widened,
brows flew up. “Impossible…” he said in astonishment. “Who could
gather that much?”</p>

<p>Oleg scooped a handful of gold coins. Their
edges were uneven, he could only see a stern hook-nosed profile on
the face side and a big <emphasis>svarga</emphasis> on the reverse. Other coins
had a three-headed mountain, which resembled a trident, on them.
Oleg recognized it, though with effort. <emphasis>The only mountain in
Atlantis. It could be seen by sailors from far away, with the
signal fires lit on its top at night and in bad weather.</emphasis> On the
reverse, there were strange signs: prototypes of lines and cuts
used in Rus’ up to the coming of Christianity…</p>

<p>Oleg went dark. He felt a heartache at
recalling the men in black clothes who burnt books and writings on
birch bark, destroyed the manuscripts written in lines and cuts,
rubbed the local script and local culture off the face of Slavic
lands in a hurry to set the other culture instead… “Saw enough of
it?” Oleg asked harshly. “Let’s go!” Without waiting for the
knight, he went to the exit of the cave quickly.</p>

<p>Thomas opened his mouth to protest, but the
wonderer’s back was seen at the other end of the cave and something
about his pace, his raised shoulders gave the knight a hint that if
he did not hurry he’d have to search the way out by himself. Oleg
was furious, as he happened to be very seldom. Whether Thomas was
guilty or not, it was better for him to keep off the heat of the
moment.</p>

<p>At breakneck pace, Thomas dashed after his
friend, without even slamming the lid shut. Oleg had vanished from
sight. Thomas hurried, his soul pounded with fear. He swore not to
let Satan entice him with either gold or gems, as it is shame for a
Christian to yield where a benighted Pagan resisted… <emphasis>However,
the Pagan may simply not know the true worth of treasures.</emphasis></p>

<p>The great hall opened at once: Thomas had
just darted from under the arch. His legs gave way. He felt crushed
by the magnificence. The cave shone with green malachite. One of
the walls was vertical, a great radiant throne towered near it.
Three marble stairs led to the throne, and a huge golden
<emphasis>svarga</emphasis> was glaring above it!</p>

<p>Thomas walked by the wonderer’s side, half a
step behind. His heart thumped very fast. His feet stepped on the
dented stairs, time-worn and scratched by sharp claws of all the
ants who ran there for thousands of years.</p>

<p>The closer they came to the throne, the
bigger it seemed. It must have been made for a man twenty or thirty
feet tall if human at all. Thomas gasped, nudged Oleg gently. On
the right of the throne, a broad sword, three times as tall as a
man, hung on a wall hook. The pendants on its wide handle were the
size of a knight’s shield, the smallest of gems were as large as
Thomas’s fist. “Were they giants,” Thomas asked, for some strange
reason, in a whisper, “or heroes?”</p>

<p>Oleg looked around vacantly, waved aside.
“Forget it. We need charms, no golden trinkets!”</p>

<p>Suddenly. Thomas saw huge logs at the other
end of the hall. It took him some time to grasp those were
clean-picked bones: human – if any man could be that tall – bones
and skulls, as though the last guards of the underground palace
stayed remained forever! “Were that ants?” Thomas whispered even
more apprehensively. “They gobbled them?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, stop getting rubbish in your
head!” Oleg replied with annoyance. “Killed by ants, by each other,
or something else – why should we care? We need <emphasis>charms</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>“I see, I see,” Thomas said hastily and
nodded with such ardor that it caused a dangerous crunch in his
neck. “Once I got my finger trapped in the door. At that moment, I
didn’t care if all the world goes to ruin…”</p>

<p>Oleg darted past the throne, into the dark
passage that definitely had once been secret. Thomas rushed after
him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 35</p>

<p>Thomas lost count of caves, passages, slopes,
as well as bruises, when Oleg suddenly increased his pace, muttered
something, turned into a side tunnel at once. Thomas followed, like
a she-goat on a short tie, as the tunnel turned often, other holes
crossed it and the wonderer, carried away, was unlikely to look
back if even Thomas yelled at the top of his voice or howled like a
wolf.</p>

<p>Suddenly the wonderer broke into run.
“Charms!” he cried hoarsely. “I feel charms!”</p>

<p>Thomas clenched his teeth, felt his gums
bleeding, ran, darted into a colossal cave. The wonderer was barely
visible far ahead. Cursing, Thomas rushed after him, jumped over
the scattered breastplates and pieces of armor of strange forms.
Many had human bones sticking out of them, skulls cracked and
crumbled to dust under Thomas’s iron heels. He could see no floor
under the heaps of weapons that belonged to all times and nations,
shields, even some catapults, fierce curves of swords, strange
spears that also combined axes and even cleavers in themselves.</p>

<p>The wonderer was already climbing up a pile
of treasures, arms, broken fragments of golden chariots, statues of
precious metals, broken chests and trunks, decayed saddle bags with
gold coins pouring out of their holes at every touch. At last, the
wonderer gave a triumphant roar and all but fell down, along with
the unsteady top of treasure heap. Thomas’s heart froze in fright:
among the chests and chariots below, there were some darts and
swords pointed up. The wonderer held out by miracle, pointed to the
side where the ill-fated necklace could barely be seen. “That’s it!
That’s where they took it, underground devils!”</p>

<p>He ran down, jumping deftly on breastplates,
shields, and trunks. His face shone. On his go, he put the charms
on his neck.</p>

<p>Thomas yelled at the top of his voice. “Look
out, fool!”</p>

<p>Oleg leapt aside, all but cut himself on the
long sickle looking out from under the wheels of strange chariot. A
heavy mass of chests and shields thundered down past him. One trunk
burst, gold coins poured out with ringing sound. Thomas sighed: the
coins covered all the immense cave up to his ankles.</p>

<p>The wonderer jumped down to him. “That’s all!
Had a rest in cool place, now get in the sun again.”</p>

<p>“Do you really think I want to stay?”</p>

<p>“Why are you sitting then? Let’s go. I’ve
found charms. There still are gods on earth!”</p>

<p>“Pagan,” Thomas muttered. “There’s only one
God, the rest are demons. Our Lady in her unfathomable mercy has
not knocked you off like a fly, as she hopes you to turn into the
true faith. Do you know the way?”</p>

<p>“Of course I do,” the wonderer said with
surprise. “That’s really simple!”</p>

<p>“Then I know why she saved your life up to
now. Lead the way, you underground man.”</p>

<p>While they climbed out of the treasure cave
through the low dark passage, moving on their fours in places,
Thomas prayed the Holy Virgin. He felt the stone mountain pressing
on his shoulders. Stones above cracked, shifted under that
monstrous weight. In places, earth and small pebbles rained
down.</p>

<p>At the very first opportunity. Thomas
straightened his tired back up – and stopped in surprise. Ahead,
there was a giant forest of strange translucent trees. Their trunks
were three or four girths broad but only as tall as three or four
man. They had swollen excruciations instead of branches and no
leaves at all. Dark streams moved slowly within the trees,
exfoliated, twisted into caudated rings.</p>

<p>Among the strange trees, there were slowly
rambling ants, strange the same: slow, translucent, their inside
seen through. Their small sharp jaws had a dim glitter. Ants used
them to cut the trunks. A whitish layer of viscous sap came out
from notches. An ant would fell down to the cut, drain all of it,
and walk away slowly, his swollen belly dragged on the ground.</p>

<p>Unknown animals darted sometimes among the
ghostly trees. So monstrous those creatures were that poor Thomas
had his hair stand on ends of the insoluble question: could God
have created such abomination himself? Devil definitely could do it
but, as far as Thomas knew, the Almighty created all the world
himself, no part left to Devil…</p>

<p>“Keep up,” Oleg said through gritted teeth.
“You get stuck as though on the fair!”</p>

<p>“But monsters…”</p>

<p>“Domestic animals.”</p>

<p>“Domestic?”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Room</emphasis> animals if it please you. Room
or cave… Even gods may have forgotten what ants bred these animals
for. Ants may have forgotten that too. Either fun or work or
hunt…”</p>

<p>Thomas squeezed himself against the wall to
let disgusting animals pass, jumped up if one darted between his
legs, and dashed between the legs of bigger ones himself: falling
down on his belly with a thunder, his armor ringing, his eyes
closed tight.</p>

<p>Thomas plunged after the wonderer into a dark
tunnel, walked along, bending down in places and sinking to his
fours in others. The passage was a steep rise, sometimes they had
to climb up all but vertically. The air gradually turned warmer,
less damp. Thomas got hot and sweaty. At last, he gasped with
malice, “I feel going up! But are you sure there’s a way out? We
meet no ants anymore!”</p>

<p>“Are we bound to return to the same place
precisely?”</p>

<p>Thomas wanted to say that definitely they
weren’t, the main thing was to get out, no matter whether it would
be woods or hot desert or even the nomad camp of terrible
bloodthirsty Pechenegs, but the wonderer’s voice seemed sneering.
Thomas paused – and the pile of gold nuggets he had left in hundred
steps from the entrance into the ants’ burrow flashed in his mind!
“Well,” he forced out, “let us get out where we happen to get. May
it just be in sun!”</p>

<p>“Then we’ll have to linger,” Oleg said
thoughtfully. “It’s night there above.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!”</p>

<p>“Let’s keep going,” Oleg replied, as he heard
dangerous notes in the voice of exhausted knight. “Stars may also
make a sun to someone.”</p>

<p>Oleg reached out his hand to help Thomas to
climb: he had heavy armor on, no light shirt, but the knight dodged
with indignation, only asked in a hoarse voice, “Is the entrance
close?”</p>

<p>“Close,” Oleg comforted hastily. “That’s said
by charms.”</p>

<p>“Thus saith the Teacher,” Thomas muttered
under his breath.</p>

<p>“What?” Oleg asked with surprise.</p>

<p>“I often heard that from my tutor,” Thomas
explained. “While learning quadrivium, as every knight is obliged
to… Has Christ ever been to these ants?.. The Holy Book says
nothing of that but he spent forty days alone in the desert where
Satan tempted him. Now I know <emphasis>what</emphasis> the temptation was…”</p>

<p>The shining wall facing was left far behind,
they groped their way in complete darkness. Should Thomas touch the
walls with head or shoulders, as he did constantly, earth and small
pebbles fell down. Once there came a shower of dirty water and
soaked him all over.</p>

<p>“Damn them for not strengthening their
walls!” Thomas swore. “They are <emphasis>ants</emphasis>! Though the ones of
Herodotus. Diligent, hard-working… Every good master would have
done that long ago.”</p>

<p>“We are far beyond their anthill,” Oleg
comforted.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“Thomas, you have the stamina of warhorse,
but even so I’d have to drag you. And I value my back.”</p>

<p>“Is it a straighter way?”</p>

<p>“Half a mile.”</p>

<p>“And over?”</p>

<p>“Er… just a bit over.”</p>

<p>“Then two miles,” Thomas resolved. In the
dark, he recoiled with such force that his armor clanged, the rock
got shaking and a landslip thundered behind them. “Well,” he said
reluctantly, “let’s go straight. As straight as a crow flies!”</p>

<p>The wonderer found his bearings in some way:
he kept warning of pits and ledges with his voice. Sometimes he
gripped Thomas in the dark, which made him scream in fright,
dragged into a crack, as narrow as a mouse hole, that Thomas would
have never found on his own but kept beating against walls for the
rest of his lifetime, like a goat beats against manger.</p>

<p>“Is it close?” Thomas kept asking. The
wonderer’s hands were holding him constantly then, and Thomas had
no strength to push them away.</p>

<p>Once they saw a glimmer of light ahead,
Thomas first thought it just seemed to him: he had spots of light
floating before his eyes for a long time, but the wonderer dragged
him on, urged, swore. Thomas climbed with his last strength,
clutched at stones, pulled his heavy body up, rested his feet,
groped blindly with his fingers spread wide apart.</p>

<p>He tumbled out on the surface, fell down on
his back, his goggled eyes looking in the sky, so bright with stars
and dented moon. The wonderer breathed hoarsely nearby. Thomas
heard his choking voice. “I’d never believe… what pride brings to…
Sir Thomas… you hero! Knights of Round Table not fit to hold a
candle…”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Thomas whispered with
protest, though he felt flattered.</p>

<p>There were shrubs on both sides and a crest
blocking the sight ahead, but Thomas could see the bare top of a
tall mountain. A silent shadow of a night bird, probably an owl,
darted to that side. They heard a squeak in the dark, then silence
again.</p>

<p>A grasshopper went chirring warily near
Thomas. The knight looked there: the tiny green singer was seated
on a grass blade in a foot from his face. The creature was fat,
potbellied. He cast guarded looks at the giant monster but
persisted in moving his jaggy leg on the edge of hard wing.</p>

<p>Thomas smiled, being moved by that. The
grasshopper is definitely afraid: his big eyes goggled in fright,
his feelers trembling with fear, but he chirrs his song, upholding
his territory, his lands, his castle bravely against the intruding
monster. Thomas moved away carefully. If he frights the bold
warrior singer away, the latter will be deprived of his dominion.
Other lands are all occupied and divided by others, so he, poor
thing, will have to either hire or turn a knight errant. “What’s
bad about being an errant knight?” Thomas said aloud and got
surprised by own hoarse voice, as croaking as an old ill
crow’s.</p>

<p>The wonderer stirred nearby, sat up heavily.
His face was wet with sweat, stained with dirt. “You speak truth.
The one who once made a trip around his house knows more than the
one who stayed on his stove.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer… where are we? It’s mountains,
no steppes…”</p>

<p>“Just one mountain,” Oleg corrected. He
rubbed his face with force, trying to drive the tiredness away, but
only spread the dirt over. “Surrounded by steppe that has no end…
Things look black, Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>“Again?!” Thomas moaned.</p>

<p>“Agathyrsians took us far to the northeast,
you know. Now we have to cross flat steppes full of savage nations
who kill strangers with no mercy. What is more, here we are in full
view of Secret Seven. And the third thing… which threatens trouble
only to you… we got so far to the east that no horse in the world
will get you to Britain before the day of Saint Boromir!”</p>

<p>Thomas rose a bit, collapsed face first. He
did not want the wonderer to see his bitter tears. His heart was
wrung with pain, he felt a jerk and grasped that crying, which is
so easy to women, tears a man’s chest. “Then… I die,” he whispered.
“Sir wonderer… I need no life without Krizhina. And she… she won’t
just stay alone… but get in hands of evil men… they’ll make her
unhappy!”</p>

<p>Oleg watched him with pity and anxiety,
fingering his found charms. As he sat a bit higher, he could see
the whole mountain: precipitous, its foot covered with dense forest
all over. Only the top remained bare. The rocky wall had cracks but
no seed of a tree took root there, even grass blades failed to
clutch at the red granite, nestle in those cracks. “Fetch the
firewood,” Oleg said suddenly. “I’ll go round to the mountain.”</p>

<p>Thomas jerked his head languidly: let all the
world go to ruin if he had to part with his love, but the wonderer
got up quickly, broke into the thickets like an elk, with only a
rustle of bushes.</p>

<p>The morning came to be dull and chilly.
Thomas got cold, his armor cooled. He shivered, his teeth started
to chatter. His body was shaken all over by foul shudder, so he
struggled up his feet, dragged together some dry twigs, which he
found close in the narrow valley, managed to strike a fire. His
fingers were disobedient: thrice he dropped the flint and spent a
long time raking through twigs and dry grass in search of it.</p>

<p>The twigs got on fire fast, smokeless. It
licked their grey curves with orange, gnawed at cracks and hollows
with red teeth, started to crack them like well-warmed nuts. For a
long while, Thomas sat by the fire, watching the dance of red
flames with no thought at all, then came back to his senses as he
warmed, went out of the cleft, spotted a distant stream, which
could be guessed by the rich green grass.</p>

<p>He failed to stick the kettle on coals and
had to drive some stakes in. Leaving the water on the boil, he
plodded back to the stream. The wonderer had taught him a Scythian
way of fishing and Thomas also knew Anglic way since he was a
child. Before the water boiled, he came back carrying five big fish
and two score of smaller ones in his shirt with tied sleeves.</p>

<p>He dumped his wriggling and jumping prey on
the ground, pressed down quickly the head of the biggest burbot.
With the wonderer’s sharp knife, he cut its tender white belly
through, pulled out dark mucous guts and the swimming bladder that
felt supple and elastic, tore away the orange liver: it had an
amber glitter and was so juicy that the very sight of it made him
drool over and his mortal agony, in some imperceptible way, started
to turn into gentle sorrow.</p>

<p>Once he cleaned the small fish, he threw them
into boiling water. He slashed a sweet juice-dripping stripe out of
the big fat river animal, sliced it, sprinkled with the strange
grey salt of Agathyrsians and, while the fish soup was cooked, he
chewed that raw juicy meat. He chewed, screwing up with joy, his
mouth squelching and champing, heavy drops of limpid juice hanging
in the corners of it.</p>

<p>The water in the kettle went bubbling, he
glimpsed a head with one goggled eye, outstretched fins in the
turbid foam. It smelled of fish soup, splashes fell on the burning
coals with a sweet hiss. Thomas sniffed, then scooped, blew at the
turbid odorous liquid for a long time: a sip of hot would knock his
taste off, make him unable to feel whether the stew was good or
needed some more boiling, salt, or herbs. At last, he made a
careful sip, tasted it in his mouth for a while, salted, tried
again, put the spoon aside with content, feeling his grief not that
gnawing anymore. <emphasis>It will come right at the end, as the wonderer
puts it. Off chance there is still hope. Our souls are not out of
place in this world… The wonderer will collapse of surprise. A
Pagan, he thinks of knights as a likeness of rams, hitting each
other on tourneys all the days long and capable of nothing
more!</emphasis></p>

<p>He fetched a supply of twigs, trying to keep
himself busy always, lest the anguish come back to claw his soul.
It will come right, it will all come right at the end. May the
wonderer repeat these words so frequently because he’s also eaten
by some grief unknown to the knight? Though so imperturbable in
looks? Completely immersed in his thoughts? Or… incompletely? Off
chance it will come right for him too…</p>

<p>The fish soup was cold when the shrubs
cracked, he heard heavy steps. The wonderer moved slowly, dragged
his feet. Thomas felt a prick of conscience: the wonderer was no
less tired but he went scouting!</p>

<p>Oleg ate his meal vacantly, though he did
express surprise of the knight’s strange skill: if no poor devil’s
misfortune to be born a knight, he could have luck to make a good
cook. Oleg supped all of the stew, sucked big bones around, but his
eyes were vacant and roving. He often seized his charms, stretched
his neck, sniffed the air like a hound.</p>

<p>Thomas got anxious, reached for his sword.
Suddenly the wonderer grabbed his bow, drew the string on, felt the
stretched tendon critically with his thick nail before throwing the
quiver of arrows in his back and moving his shoulders to set their
feathered ends straight below his left shoulder.</p>

<p>“You stay,” he ordered Thomas gloomily.
“Aurochs coming.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you like fish soup?” Thomas muttered.
“I saw a bustard here, fat quails crying breathlessly… Why a huge
aurochs?”</p>

<p>“It will make a quail to someone,” Oleg
replied mysteriously. “Or even a fly.” He climbed out of the cleft,
walked past the stream, stopped behind a tree. A big bustard
emerged from the low shrubs nearby. A fat she-quail, followed by
her brood, passed by in hundred steps, dragging her wing in case,
but the wonderer gave her no second look.</p>

<p>Oleg’s nostrils twitched. He even pressed his
ear to the ground, got up contented, showed his thumb to
Thomas.</p>

<p>The ground started to tremble, they heard
approaching rumble. A cloud of yellow dust rose far away, growing
slowly. In front of it, there was a dark stripe. Soon Thomas
discerned individual animals. It was a herd of aurochs rushing in
avalanche, as though escaping some terrible thing.</p>

<p>Oleg put a heavy arrow on the bow string,
waited. It seemed to Thomas still too early when he flung, as
though with his whole body, the arrow forward. The tendon string
made a resonant click against his leather glove. His right hand put
the second arrow on, pulled the string on, bending the bow creepily
into a wheel.</p>

<p>Arrows swished through the air: heavy,
destructive, coming one upon another. Thomas watched with
admiration: he had never seen the wonderer shooting that quickly
and forcefully before.</p>

<p>The first arrow went into the breast of a big
young aurochs up to the feather, others hit the youth, well-fed
bull-calves, creepily and accurately. Thomas drew out his sword,
rushed to the herd in fighting excitement. The aurochs dashed past,
two score of them remained on the ground.</p>

<p>Thomas slashed the injured animals quickly,
turned his shining excited face to the wonderer. “I’ve never seen
such a splendid hunt!”</p>

<p>“I’m out of arrows,” Oleg replied with
vexation.</p>

<p>“Or you’d have killed the whole herd?.. I
didn’t expect you to be such a keen hunter!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” the wonderer asked, “would you
do me a favor? Please help to skin them. It would also be good to
take all the meat off bones.”</p>

<p>Thomas threw his blooded sword aside and set
to the true men’s work: the joy of it could hardly be understood by
women and monks. He skinned the aurochs deftly, cut away their
hearts and liver, which were to make man’s arms and will strong,
hurled on the laid skin. Oleg cut the meat off hastily, rolled into
the skins, which were still bleeding, dragged into a deep cleft.
Thomas did not rack his brain over the wonderer’s plans: he gave
all of himself to the amusement of knight, as though back to his
blessed Britain!</p>

<p>Oleg picked up two slices of meat, went
climbing up the slope. Thomas followed him with vacant eyes: high
above, there was a wide stone ledge, a huge black hollow over it
looked like a spare way out for Agathyrsians with all their
belongings, kettle, carts, and herds. If the wonderer preferred a
look into that hole, he risked to have no taste of tender sirloin
roasting on the coals, spreading over befuddling odors, like a
flower. But if a sweet flower drives bumblebees and butterflies
mad, that smell could do the same even to a noble knight who passed
Crimea and Rome and even saw the priest’s pear tree, though he
still did not know what the wonderer found peculiar about
it.<sup>24</sup></p>

<p>He gulped down the saliva of hunger, waiting
patiently for the wonderer to come back. Oleg came long after,
tired, with his elbows scratched, rolled two more big slices into
fresh-off skins, darted away. Thomas spat angrily and had his meal
in proud solitude. That time the wonderer did not turn up so long
that Thomas got anxious. To while away the waiting time, he lay
down with his head on his sword, fell asleep.</p>

<p>He woke up and gasped: the sun got half below
the skyline. The wonderer messed about the fading fire: blew the
coals up, tossed new twigs. “Keep sleeping,” he comforted the
knight. “You need a counsel with your pillow.”</p>

<p>“What pillow?” Thomas grumbled in vexation.
“God gives day, devil gives sorrows.”</p>

<p>“Sorrows? But also a horse.”</p>

<p>“Who gives it?” Thomas asked. “God or
devil?”</p>

<p>The wonderer put the kettle of water on the
fire, squatted with groan. “I’m not good at Christian mythology.
You may think the horse is sent by my gods. They once were
<emphasis>your</emphasis> gods too…”</p>

<p>His face darkened. The faith and gods of
others were then brought at the points of swords to his native land
too, and Russian temples were burnt and destroyed! And sorcerers
were beheaded, quartered, impaled to strengthen the faith of
Christ. “Sleep, Sir Thomas.” He did not command but asked in half a
voice, as though his throat squeezed by one’s strong hand.
“Sleep…”</p>

<p>Strangely, Thomas fell fast asleep all but at
once, making up for lost time. He opened his eyes again at dawn,
when the sun set fire to clouds with its blazing arrows and the
eastern edge of the sky was golden and ready to flare. The wonderer
sat at the same place by the fire, in the same doleful pose. As he
saw or guessed Thomas awake, he got up slowly to his feet. Thomas
heard a distinct crunch of Oleg’s stiffened joints.</p>

<p>“Get up, brave knight! I see the great future
of Angles. Drag the meat out…” He was interrupted by a thundering
roar. A small avalanche came down the steep slope: stones rushed
down, crushing shrubs and small trees. Thomas seemed to see a cloud
of bluish smoke emerging from the dark hole.</p>

<p>Oleg clasped his hands in fright, dashed up
the steep slope. The heavy sword bounced on his back: the baldric
was not clasped tight. Thomas gave a shudder, pulled his sword out,
took a firmer stand and started to wait, gripping the sword hilt
with both hands.</p>

<p>Climbing, the wonderer all but reached the
hole when there was a red flash in the dark. A scary green paw came
out: as large as a log, very sharp-clawed, covered with thick
plates of scales…</p>

<p>The claws scratched on the stone, leaving
deep marks. After that, a grey-green rock came out from the cave,
as it seemed to Thomas, but that rock suddenly came apart and
Thomas got his legs trembling: it was <emphasis>a dragon</emphasis>! Sir Gawain,
according to singers, had once slain a dragon as large as a
warhorse but that one was ten times that large! Even with less than
half of his body out, he looked like a long barn, his back covered
with bony plates that turned thick scales on his sides, each scale
the size of a knightly shield. The dragon’s head was as large as a
bull, and his mouth could easily house a nanny goat with two
kids!</p>

<p>The dragon opened his mouth, as red as hell’s
stove, his teeth like daggers, uttered a sullen roar. Thomas
dropped his sword and clutched at the helmet, lest it be blown away
with the terrible wind. The beast’s nostrils were curved like
doghouses, emitted either steam or smoke. His eyes were two kettle
bottoms: prominent, huge, unblinking. His belly rubbed against
stones with a screech of Egyptian pyramid being dragged, his back
brushed on the vault, the bony plates were showered with pebbles
and earth dust. The beast’s paws were similar to frog’s or lizard’s
if one could imagine a lizard as big as a hill.</p>

<p>The beast stopped, jerked its huge snout,
squinting in the bright sun. The sunrays got refracted in the
prominent eyes covered with a transparent film of skin. The dragon
gave a roar again, started backing and hunching. His flabby neck,
in faded, shabby bony mails, got wrinkled with thick folds.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 36</p>

<p>Trembling all over, Thomas said loudly a
prayer to Holy Virgin, the defender and patroness of bold warriors,
entreating her to drive the dragon back into the hole: that beast
was too huge even for Lancelot together with all the Knights of the
Round Table to cope… Suddenly he stopped praying, swore angrily,
with bad words of all the saints, their mothers, children, and
relatives: the wonderer had climbed on the stone ledge, picked up
the crumpled skin, and rushed to the beast!</p>

<p>Thomas bellowed, calling the foolish Pagan
not to get into the mouth of his beastly god. The human sacrifice
was cancelled by Christ who became the last sacrifice himself, so
don’t be foolish, stop, wait… <emphasis>If I had a good horse and long
lance</emphasis>, he thought angrily, <emphasis>I could gallop on the dragon.
Whether kill him or not, but die with honor. Now I can only fall
dead along with the Pagan…</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon opened his mouth, which looked
like a cellar, uttered a demanding roar. Oleg on his run flung the
skin into it. The dragon’s jaws slammed with an earth-shaking thud,
started to move, grinding the meat along with the skin, like giant
millstones.</p>

<p>Thomas climbed on the ledge near Oleg who
breathed heavily. The wonderer turned, happy to see the knight.
“Sir Thomas? Most welcome! Why no meat with you? Please bring it,
as much as you can.”</p>

<p>Thomas was out of breath, his eyes blazed
with the courage of martyr. “Sir wonderer…” he babbled, panting,
“strange games… you play…”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Play?</emphasis>” Oleg got confused. “If you see
fun in it, I’d change with you, Sir Thomas! I have stacks of work
overhead. No time for games.”</p>

<p>“And… er… dragon?”</p>

<p>“Dragon?” Oleg got confused again. “Ah,
serpent? <emphasis>That</emphasis> is the horse I told you of. Or I forgot to
tell?”</p>

<p>Thomas lowered his hefty sword, feeling a bit
ridiculous. “The… horse? No need… to fight?”</p>

<p>“No more than with your warhorse, Sir Thomas.
Only while teaching it with bridle… While we feed him, he won’t
devour us. But if he gets hungry…”</p>

<p>“I see!” Thomas cried. He did not dare to
drop his heavy sword, only sheathed it, rushed down the slope as
fast as he could. Wild ideas collided in his mind, strange faces
darted by. Thomas forced himself to think of nothing, lest he go
mad like some men in that long exhausting journey from northern
lands to Jerusalem. All sorts of things happened to those who got
into that strange new world with no winter, where people had faces
as black as tar – at first crusaders mistook them for devils from
hell – and everything went another way…</p>

<p>He dragged the meat above, bathing in sweat,
but did not dare to take off even the baldric with two-handed
sword, not to mention five-stoned armor. Oleg hurled the meat into
the mouth of dragon who opened his jaws less and less willingly. At
last he refused to open them. Oleg shoved a bleeding slice straight
to his nostrils. The dragon looked at it with disgust in lackluster
eyes and turned away, as he had no eyelids and, as Thomas realized,
could not close eyes.</p>

<p>“Enough?” Thomas asked, staggering. Turbid
sweat was pouring over his eyes, his legs giving way, worn out by
that constant climbing up and down. Thomas felt pity for monkeys
who had to climb trees all the day long.</p>

<p>“Are you kidding?” Oleg wondered. “It’s time
to carry up all the rest of meat! A saturated serpent won’t rush on
it. While hungry, he wouldn’t have devoured all of it but flung it
sideways, trampled on… He’s a very stupid animal, after all. God
created him long ago, when He was young and did not know the better
way.”</p>

<p>Thomas dragged himself back on feeble feet.
He was glad he had time for sleep and rest before, though now one
could wring him out and throw down to wipe feet on, but while he
had at least a drop of strength…</p>

<p>He dragged the meat from the cleft up the
slope, cursing through gritted teeth the stupid dragon who had too
little brain to make his hole lower, where the ground was softer,
cursing his stupid fate that drove him at the back of beyond,
though his wise tutor said one can see God staying at home, cursing
the heat. Meanwhile, the wonderer tied the bleeding slices into
skins, put one of those bundles on his back, came to the dragon and
went climbing up his huge green paw fearlessly. Clinging at bony
plates, Oleg got up the beast’s back covered with thick shell. To
Thomas, he looked like a crow on a plough horse: that kind is
constantly ridden by both crows and rooks, which peck away
horseflies and gadflies and even those white worms infesting poor
animals under their skin in heat. Such horses would walk carefully,
in order not to fright away the sharp-pecked strangers who eased
their torments.</p>

<p>The wonderer fidgeted, settling in, tied the
bundle quickly to the broad bony spike, yelled to Thomas. “Sir, I
see all of it from here! Drag up the rest of meat!”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back at the dragon’s huge
snout: it lay on his paws, his eyes covered with the film of skin
in sleep, his nostrils steamed. “Sir wonderer… Do you really want
to ride him?”</p>

<p>“Ride?” Oleg asked with concern. “Serpents
are not very good at running. So they would hide in caves and only
steal the cattle at night for the first seven years. Until they
have their wings.”</p>

<p>“Wings?”</p>

<p>“They are a bit better at flying than
running,” the wonderer explained with a grimace.</p>

<p>Thomas, dumbfounded with all that happened,
was dragging the last bundles of meat tiredly, giving them to
wonderer who set them on dragon’s back: it had spikes,
protuberances, slits between bony slabs, and the wonderer had made
a real web of ropes with enough room for both men and meat. He
walked on the dragon’s withers as though it were a barn roof. The
dragon, drowsy after a hearty meal, paid him no more heed than a
dog pays a fly. As Thomas served the meat, he kept glancing
slantwise at the dark entrance to the cave from which the dragon
leaned out. Some huge, scary shapes could be seen in there, the
depth smelled strongly of scum, stagnant water, and frogs.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dragon stirred, opened his
menacing eyes. He yawned, with his mouth opened wide, shut it with
such a creepy thud that made Thomas’s blood run cold. <emphasis>These jaws
can flatten a man in steel armor into a thin metal plate, reduce
his bones to gruel…</emphasis> “Sir Thomas,” Oleg cried anxiously, “get up
here!”</p>

<p>The dragon breathed steam out, started to
creep slowly out of the cave. The stone ceiling screeched. The huge
bony comb along the dragon’s back, which was pressed along to it
within the dark cave, was standing up. “Sir Thomas!” Oleg shouted.
“The dragon is about to fly!”</p>

<p>On both sides of dragon’s body, there were
huge colorless logs of protruding bones, as long as ship masts,
stretched with thick skin, while all the remaining skin was coiled
in thick rings on the dragon’s long back, which seemed endless as
the creature kept getting out. The wonderer sat only on his
withers, and the dragon really was a giant long lizard…</p>

<p>“Fast!” Oleg yelled fiercely. “He’s flying
up!!!” He leaned head down, holding with his feet, stretched his
arm out. Feeling deathly cold in his stomach, Thomas clutched at
the scaled log while it rushed by. He felt a jerk but held on while
the log hit the ground, its claws, as large as knives, screeched on
the stone. Thomas reached the wonderer’s hand, his face struck
against the bony plate.</p>

<p>Oleg dragged the knight up, threw a belt
around his waist, secured the other end to the comb and also, to
make it more reliable, among bony spikes and protuberances. The
crest on the dragon’s back kept unbending, as the dragon still
crawled out of the cave: his sharp needles had made a cave in the
ceiling. Thomas said loudly all the prayers he knew. As he knew
only the first words of each one, he began them again and again.
Finally, the crest got shorter, but the needles continued to the
very tip. They were especially sharp and fresh there, as though the
dragon’s tail was much younger than its owner.</p>

<p>The dragon crept up to the end of the stone
ledge, leaned his head on flabby neck down, shook it sadly
sideways. Oleg took out a dagger, stabbed it between the bony
plates suddenly, leaned with all his weight on it. The dragon gave
a piggish scream, fell from the steep, with just a scratch of claws
on the stone. Big boulders went rolling down to the foot.</p>

<p>Thomas heard the air swish around. They were
falling, in howling wind and cries of frightened birds. Thomas felt
cold, dead, he already saw the spot on the stones where he would
plop down, like a frog dropped by a stupid flying heron, with only
a clang of armor… But then, suddenly, he was pressed on the bony
plate with such force that his eyes popped out, his body got heavy,
his jaw dropped (suddenly he imagined himself in the age of
seventy).</p>

<p>He collapsed prone on the dragon’s back. The
wind stopped swishing in ears, and Thomas heard another sound:
mighty, broad flaps in the air, as though a storm wind blowing in a
ship’s sail. Thomas closed his eyes and offered the Holy Virgin an
ardent prayer for the sail enduring, as the loss of it is almost
always fatal to sailors…</p>

<p>He was sprawled on the bony plate, shabby and
scratched, whitened with rains, wind, and snow. The flapping
stopped abruptly, as though cut away. The heaviness was gone, he
heard a soft voice near his ear. “Just look…”</p>

<p>The blue sky was ahead, on the left and on
the right, even behind them. Perplexed, Thomas looked at the white
hill of wadding that floated in half a mile on the left, then
realized with fear that was no wadding but a cloud! He turned to
the right: a whole scatter of clouds and sharp rocky mountains far
below. He saw thin strips of roads, tiny groves that looked like
high grass – and the steppes beyond, scarily flat and deserted!</p>

<p>On the dragon’s both sides, huge leathery
sails were spread, the thick skin on the bridges stretched as tight
as on battle drums. The flying dragon looked like an old giant
lizard with a bat’s wings. Thomas had once seen such a creature in
his far journeys: that lizard leapt between trees, spreading its
leathery wings, but it was the size of a pigeon while the dragon
resembled a flying granary of a rich seignior.</p>

<p>Oleg prodded anxiously with dagger, searching
for a weak spot. “Sparrows flap their wings often,” he said
reluctantly, “and the bigger a bird, the more time it spends
soaring. Eagles flap seldom.”</p>

<p><emphasis>Eagles to this dragon</emphasis>, Thomas thought
uneasily, <emphasis>are flies to a swallow</emphasis>. With his weight and
colossal wings, he should ascend in several flaps and then soar for
half a day with his wings spread out! “Will we fly where we need?”
he asked in a shaky voice. “Or where the dragon likes to?”</p>

<p>Oleg shrugged. He was inspecting closely the
gaps between bony slabs on dragon’s neck and withers. The wind
ruffled the wonderer’s hair but his green eyes looked intently and
seriously. “Once men raced on dragons. And combated! Until new gods
came…”</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a terrible scream. His face
turned white as chalk, he fell on his back, twitching in
convulsion, shaking, his eyes went mad. With a shout, he jumped off
the dragon but ropes kept him on. The wonderer wheezed, his teeth
bared in a beastly way. He started to untie hastily.</p>

<p>Thomas seized him by hand. “Sir wonderer! Sir
wonderer!” Oleg flung him aside, growling. He had undone two knots,
only the last one remained. Thomas gripped his friend with both
hands, pressed to his own breast. “Sir wonderer!” he shouted in
despair. “What happened? What’s the matter with you?”</p>

<p>With no word, the wonderer struggled away,
growled, his lips foaming, his eyes mad. He tried to jump down
again but the knot kept him, then he started to pull the ends,
snarling. Thomas, seeing the death to both, seized him across his
body, brought down, pressed on the bony plates, shouting in his
face, “Sir wonderer! What’s on you? Tell me what to do!”</p>

<p>There was a brief glimpse of human mind in
his mad eyes, a quiver of lips. Thomas heard his whisper. “The
Seven…” Then Oleg growled again, wriggled, pushed Thomas aside with
force that all but dislocated his shoulder. Thomas recoiled, the
wonderer’s fingers dug into the last knot. Clenching his teeth,
Thomas pulled out his sword, brandished overhead, brought the flat
side down on the back of the wonderer’s head. Oleg collapsed
silently, face first, into the slit in bony plates. Thomas tied his
friend up quickly, hands behind, lest Oleg reach them with teeth,
tied his feet tightly to the comb and protruding spikes on the
dragon’s back.</p>

<p>The wonderer came back to himself, started to
flutter. Thomas moved away with a sigh of relief. The dragon
flapped twice, Thomas collapsed prone, but the leathery sails
stretched out at once, crashing and rustling, and the world got
still again. Thomas felt his stomach in his throat, his feet icy
with terror. He glanced back timidly at the wonderer: Oleg roared
and twitched in his bounds. The comb cracked menacingly, threating
to rub the rope through. Thomas reached the wonderer, tied him with
one more belt along his back, lest he take a firmer stand. <emphasis>He
has monstrous strength. It will do to tear any rope. And those
possessed are given strength by Devil himself!</emphasis></p>

<p>Suddenly he felt the sun on his right cheek,
though it had been on his left one before. The dragon seemed to
have turned. <emphasis>Why not? He’s not longing for Krizhina, just
soaring in search of a herd of fat cows to come down on them with a
roar, to gobble those he snatches, to burn down the shepherd if
that muddler fails to run away.</emphasis> “Sir wonderer,’ Thomas called
in a shaky voice. “Oleg! Dear friend!”</p>

<p>The wonderer dropped saliva, his body
contorted and writhing. He gnashed his teeth creepily, beat himself
against the dragon back. Thomas clenched his teeth, trying not to
look down: under the dragon’s belly, as white as a frog’s, there
was a terrific abyss and the flat steppes floated in two or three
miles below!</p>

<p>He drew his sword out, put it clumsily into
the slit between plates, held his breath. The dragon made a full
circle, with no move of wings, just rocking slightly in the warm
rising flows of air. Thomas pressed cautiously on the hilt, ready
to pull it out and recoil at every moment. Dragon kept soaring in
the same idle way, in the warm summer air clean of dust and
annoying flies, even the clouds under his belly as white as it
was.</p>

<p>The sword got stuck, whether in gristles or
small bones, so Thomas struggled to take it a scale closer to the
neck, to the place where the wonderer had stabbed with his dagger.
He had to redo the ropes. In times, the dragon started to flap
wings, all of a sudden, jumped swiftly up into the sky, the cold
wind made Thomas’s fingers numb and eyes water.</p>

<p>When he put the sword blade into the narrow
slit between bony blocks, shabby, with broken edges, the dragon
turned his head suddenly to give Thomas a close look. The knight’s
hands got cold, fingers unclenched. Fortunately, he had the sword
hilt tied to his hand, otherwise he’d have lost it. The dragon’s
eyes were slowly becoming bloodshot, his breath puffed out of
nostrils more often. In terror, Thomas realized the flying dragon
could reach own back, as well as the tip of tail, with those awful
jaws. <emphasis>No place to hide!</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon looked back again. With open jaws,
he reached for Thomas, his neck bent creepily, bony scales
screeching. Thomas backed in panics, the ropes stretched, keeping
him in place. He felt a puff of stinky heat, as though fat
carcasses were burnt in a huge stove.</p>

<p>He touched his sword helplessly, his fingers
found some hairy thing. He pulled it, tore the rope off, flung the
bundle into the mouth that had covered half the sky. The skin, with
slices of meat rolled inside, plopped straight on the dragon’s
tongue. The beast shut his jaws, moved them heavily to the right,
then to the left, stretched reluctantly into a likeness of flying
duck, soaring lazily, spreading his enormous wings that would do to
cover any peasant’s field.</p>

<p>Thomas sobbed. His fingers trembled, heart
pounded like a sheep tail. He sat like a mite on the back of most
huge dragon… if even he swears it, no one would believe!.. flying
over the clouds, his possessed friend rattling and wriggling in
ties behind… <emphasis>What’s next?</emphasis> If the dragon wanted to gobble
him, he would throw meat instead: that is what the wonderer
prepared it for, but how long would that suffice? <emphasis>What if the
dragon won’t land?</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas shrugged with a shiver: the constant
head wind was really cool. <emphasis>Should I make the dragon
land?</emphasis></p>

<p>Trembling all over, with a dagger in hand, he
peered into the slits between bony plates. In the middle of the
back they were colossal: the dagger was too short to reach the
vulnerable place with its point. He redid the knots, feeling like a
nanny-goat on a tie, crawled on his fours to the neck, clinging at
bony protuberances and holding his dagger in no knightly way at all
– clenched in his teeth. <emphasis>Fortunately, no noble sir here to see
me in such a humiliating pose. Though I’m on a dragon, not on a
cow!</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon’s back went down abruptly, all of
a sudden. Thomas clutched at the edge of the slab in panics. His
body lost weight, all around the dragon went milky white at once,
then the whiteness remained above: they were falling down like
rocks. His heart stopped, being wrung as if it belonged to the most
fearful hare frightened even by frogs.</p>

<p>Thomas clutched with all his might, feeling
torn away from the solid surface, though that surface was also
falling, falling, falling… A sudden resonant flap, and his chin hit
against the surface that suddenly jumped up to meet him, with such
a force that his fingers clanged like swords in battle. His mouth
felt hot and salty, his head filled with lid, as well as his whole
body. He was heavy, sprawled like a squashed frog, even his
thoughts could barely stir, heavy and desperate. <emphasis>What all these
torments for?</emphasis></p>

<p>The wings flapped mightily for a long time.
The dragon ascended in jerks. Thomas was now released, now pressed
with force on the solid, his bones crushed, his body filled with
heavy blood. The dragon must have been descending to the very
ground, fascinated by some cow but scared away by either shepherd
or errant knights. <emphasis>And now he must have decided to crush riders
flat against the firmament!</emphasis></p>

<p>As Thomas recalled his helpless friend, he
glanced back, crossed him hastily. Oleg’s head hung helplessly, his
chin rested on his chest, ropes had dug deeply into his mighty
body. He was pale, flinching in times, groaning through gritted
teeth.</p>

<p>“Be patient a bit,” Thomas said, choking with
pity. “Once this winged frog stops turning head over heels… I’ll
say a prayer for exorcism of devil. Or at least of demons. If only
I recall it…”</p>

<p><emphasis>One can hardly recall what one never
knew.</emphasis> In terror, Thomas thought of a priest whom he needed to
find as soon as possible: a priest to sprinkle the possessed with
holy water, say a prayer, wave a censer of labdanum and incense,
which Christ replaced the human sacrifice with. <emphasis>Well, I’ll see
the church from a distance. But how to make dragon land before the
priest’s house? He will definitely object to it. He belongs to
impious pre-Christian world and can bear no sight of the
Cross!</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon glanced back for a moment, then
flew straight for a while, paying no heed to his riders. When he
glanced back again, Thomas had crawled back and was undoing in
hurry, breaking his nails, the knot on the closest sack of aurochs
skin. “What an eater!” he said with loathing when the open mouth
reached for him. “Too much food ruins your guts, as the wonderer
says! I’d like you as a hermit.”</p>

<p>He flung three big slices in, one after
another, and when he reached for the fourth one, the dragon turned
away, screwing up his eyes with content. His jaws grinded the juicy
boneless meat with a crunch, his lips foamed with blood, the wind
tore it away and threw at the knight. Thomas wiped the sticky
saliva off with disgust. moved away, closer to the wonderer. As he
got tired of doing and undoing his ropes, he left only the thickest
one around his waist. “Sir wonderer!” he called sadly. “Oh, sir
wonderer…”</p>

<p>He hunched to save the last warmth, glanced
at the wonderer with a heavy sigh, and went crawling, a dagger in
hand that time, from the dragon’s withers to the neck. The long
blade slid in between the scales, as thick as a fist, touched the
stout skin. Thomas thrust it with more force, the skin tensed, the
blade was thrown up. He recalled the wonderer, clenched his teeth,
and leaned on the dagger with all his weight. The skin caved in a
bit but endured. Thomas called the Virgin for help, cursed, hit the
hilt with his iron fist.</p>

<p>The dagger went in for a palm deep, the
dragon gave a shudder, his wings stirred a bit. Thomas clutched at
the bony protuberances, ready for a fall, a dance in the air, but
the dragon kept soaring in the same sleepy way, his broad wings
spread wide. He warmed himself, catching sunrays with those huge
dark sails. <emphasis>Even closed his eyes with joy, a brute.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas clenched his jaws, banged the dagger
hilt with all his force. There was a jerk beneath, Thomas would
have flown off and down if not the rope. The dragon gave a hoarse
cry, beat his wings frequently, turned around in a slanting arch,
flapped his wings again. “That is it,” Thomas said exhaustedly,
through gritted teeth. His breath was fast and sobbing, his teeth
clanged, his hands shook like a hen thief’s. “They raced on
dragons! And jousted, you see…”</p>

<p>The sun warmed his left cheek, but the dragon
rocked in the flows of air more often, making Thomas clutch
convulsively at bony ledges. He turned his eyes away in fright from
the brim but could not forget the terrific void, which was straight
under the dragon’s belly. He tried not to take his hands off. At
every stir, he would clench his fingers and press his cheek on the
crackling bony slab – one of those moving under him, rubbing,
sliding apart. Once the dragon scratched himself as he flew:
Thomas’s blood turned ice when, quite near him, the claws as large
as Saracen swords scratched the side noisily, shaving the bony
armor on it.</p>

<p>Thomas pulled out his sword in fear, started
to prickle the dragon. The loathsome beast screwed up sweetly,
stretched his neck. In fact, the knight was scratching him like a
fat pampered boar. The sword blade made a tin screech on hard
scales, each the size of a palm,</p>

<p>When the dragon flapped his wings suddenly –
and he always did that all of a sudden – his body sank abruptly
into the abyss, Thomas dropped his sword, gladly it was tied to his
hand, and clutched at the bony back, like a mite, His heart and
stomach climbed up to his throat, his eyes got covered with mortal
agony, then a forceful flap of wings made him sprawl on the dragon
back, like a frog filled with lid. He could not move even his
smallest finger, his eyes all but burst with the rush of heavy
blood.</p>

<p>Gradually, the dragon bore right. Cursing,
Thomas made himself crawl up to the neck, drive the dagger in with
force. The dragon gave a caw and turned, flapping his leather sails
fussily.</p>

<p>Thomas crept back, keeping his eyes on the
widening bone plates: the dragon’s neck was no thicker than a
hundred-year-old oak, the fathomless void on both sides. Sitting on
the broad withers, Thomas took a breath, tried to tame the shiver
in his limbs.</p>

<p>Suddenly the dragon started moving his wings
frequently, for no ascend but a rush forward, so swift that Thomas
was all but blown off by the head wind, the ropes stretched and
trembled. Pounding the air with dark sails, the dragon was coming
upon a flock of white swans that flapped evenly their wings, huge
and snow white. The last swan had no time to look over before the
dragon opened his jaws and the swans were pulled into, one by one,
no less than two score in total. Only the leader flying at the head
of his flock managed to duck down, breaking away straight from the
teeth, dropped a couple of tail feathers.</p>

<p>The dragon stretched his wings, soared
happily, and followed the fleeing swan with hardly a glance: a lion
pays that much heed to stupid goats when they literally step on the
drowsy king of beasts after he had a hearty dinner. Thomas
estimated the total weight of the flock. Obviously, the dragon had
overeaten in hunting excitement, even his breath got heavy. <emphasis>No
feeding for at least an hour.</emphasis></p>

<p>He took a breath and, for the first time,
dared to take his eyes off the scary horned snout. On both sides of
the flying dragon, dense clouds slipped past. When sometimes the
winged beast got higher, Thomas watched in astonishment the white
field below, which looked like snowy. Sometimes the glutton of a
dragon forgot to flap its wings, descended slowly, the wisps of
mist went up on his sides. In times the mist was thick enough to
hide the wings completely. Once Thomas glanced back and could not
see the tail. The mist concealed even the dragon’s head, which was
dangerously close: Thomas hurried to take a slice of meat out and
held it in his outstretched arm. <emphasis>If he snaps, he’ll have my
fingers, not all of me.</emphasis></p>

<p>Dragon fell down from the clouds. Thomas
could see valleys, sparse woods, silvery snakes of meandering
rivers below. He felt a vague surprise at the Lord’s having set
hills and dales and drawn rivers in such a fanciful way. <emphasis>Soon
good mapping will cease</emphasis>, he thought anxiously. <emphasis>Dragons die
out, stop breeding, and how’s a precise map is to be made if not
from dragonback?</emphasis></p>

<p>In times the dragon forgot to flap his wings
at all. The ground came closer, Thomas crawled onto his neck and
stabbed the dagger. Then the dragon would give a start, as though
awaking, and flap his leathery wings in panics, like a hen flying
from one fence onto another.</p>

<p>The ground went down swiftly, Thomas got
sprawled. He was not trembling anymore, the seeds of admiration
sprouted in his terror-stricken soul. A Christian, he got into
Pagan world, which was only to be cleaned with sword and fire of
witches, magic, dragons, brownies, trolls… <emphasis>And now this horned
evil creature is likely to hit on the firmament, flatten the
warrior of Christ into a wet spot on it.</emphasis> Thomas glanced above
apprehensively, afraid of catching on the nails that keep the vault
of heaven: their silver heads could only be seen at night…</p>

<p>Screwing up all of his courage, he took the
risk of taking his hand off the protruding bony platen, patted
caringly the bag on his belt, with a prominent side of precious cup
within. <emphasis>God and Christ’s blood with us! If even the dragon was
created by Devil, he now serves the good. The utmost power of
Christ is that foe should not always be destroyed, all priests say
that. The highest valor of the Crusader is to make enemy serve. And
if killing a Saracen is not obligatory, killing a dragon is even
less so. Beast is no human, it’s always innocent. Even the fiercest
ones know not what they do. Even sharks are innocent, it was God
who created them that way…</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas made a pinch of his fingers, going to
cross furtively the back he sat on, but then hesitated. What if the
creature of Devil blazes up with Hell’s fire and fells down like a
torch? <emphasis>Angels may not catch the loyal warrior of Christ, as they
are busy or fail to notice, Our Lady has a babe in arms, so I’ll
plop down a mile or two and the cup rolls under somewhere
again…</emphasis></p>

<p>He undid the knots hastily, decided not to
take out the cup but put his hand into. His fingertips felt a
ticklish quiver, as though the prominent side recognized him, its
true knight, and got warmer of his touch.</p>

<p>Thomas sighed, tied the rope up tighter,
hunched and put his hands into armpits. The wind was chilling to
the marrow, though his armor sheltered him like in a doghouse, but
the blow came into slits and his skin was not as thick as
dragon’s.</p>

<p>All the breadth of the sky was blue: on the
right and left, ahead and behind. Far to the left, a line of geese
flew past but the dragon was whether oblivious of them or full up.
On the right, there also emerged some strange spot. Thomas was too
chilled to watch it closely, but the spot approached and he saw a
long carpet, painted with all colors, very hairy. In the middle of
it, there sat a stooped man in turban. He was definitely cold too:
hunched, wrapping himself in his colored robe. The carpet,
twitching like a fat hairy caterpillar, crept almost in the same
direction but the dragon was much faster. Thomas caught a glimpse
of the tired swarthy face, as the man followed them with envious
hopeless eyes. For a moment Thomas had a wish to show a rope end to
him, as rude seaman did when outstripping another ship, but his
natural knightly nobility was against vulgar gestures. What is
more, his fingers were too frozen even to make a fig and could
hardly hold a rope.</p>

<p>The man on the carpet was flying too low:
several crows, cawing with malice, went chasing him, but the man
only hunched up and stooped, pulling his robe over his cold ears.
After the crows saw him off their territory, they left him, started
to fly in circles, like proud eagles.</p>

<p>The dragon kept flying on and on. Thomas got
tired, cold, and hungry as a hunter. The wonderer dropped his head,
his chin rested on his chest, and hung there still. He was as
deathly pale as before. Thomas turned away with a sigh again.
Clutching at protuberances and falling sprawled under own weight
was already habitual.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 37</p>

<p>That was how they flew until midday. The
wonderer did not came to himself, though stopped writhing. Twice
Thomas corrected the dragon who, like a horse with one blind eye,
persisted in trying to turn and fly in a circle, but Thomas watched
the sun: fortunately, the flight was above clouds most of the time.
He adjusted for the moves of sun itself: by God’s decree, it rises
on the east, creeps across the vault of heaven to the west, goes
into the hole there to be dragged underground all the night long by
damned sinners to the eastern edge of the earth. During the summer,
sinners get tired, in autumn they move slower and slower and in
winter – like sleepy flies. By spring, the patience of the
Underground Lord runs out, so he hurls the draggers into Gehenna
and harnesses fresh ones instead. <emphasis>Maybe the next team will
include Gorvel and his Saracens.</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon turned his head only once. Thomas
flung two slices deftly into the jaws and the third one missed: the
dragon started to turn away at that moment. Thomas swore, following
the heavy slice with regretful eyes. He felt a move in his stomach,
a plaintive croak.</p>

<p>Thomas squirmed. Having a meal on the back of
a flying dragon seemed rather stupid, but Thomas was really hungry
and the bloody dragon’s champing made his mouth water.</p>

<p>He untied a sack, then a second one, found
the bundle of aurochs livers. He took one of them out: quivering it
was, as though still alive, and slick. He had to dig his fingers
into the very bleeding middle lest he drop it. His teeth dug into
the juicy flesh with a crunch, blood splashed out on his hands, but
Thomas imagined himself in the native woods on the bank of Don.
<emphasis>With my loyal suite, we would chase down a deer, cut him on the
spot, throw guts to dogs, and divide liver among ourselves quickly,
while it is warm!</emphasis></p>

<p>He gave a start, all but dropped a slice when
a hoarse voice said behind, “He’s gobbling… And the dragon?”</p>

<p>The wonderer raised his head. His eyes seemed
reproachful, some strange sparkles glittered in them. Screaming
happily, Thomas rushed up to his friend, tucked the liver into a
slit on the go, lest the wind blow it away, seized him by tightly
bound shoulders. “Sir wonderer! Are you… awake?”</p>

<p>“Did I snore?” the wonderer asked. His green
eyes were clear, he looked attentively at Thomas, then at own body
tied up tightly with ropes.</p>

<p>“Just a bit,” Thomas assured. “Though I and
the dragon heard none of it.”</p>

<p>“Was it you to tie me?”</p>

<p>“Er… the dragon was busy. Flapping his wings.
Our friends Seven of Secret have sent a bad dream on you, so
I…”</p>

<p>Oleg nodded, winced. “Now their attack is
gone. Untie me.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked with shining eyes, a load was
taken off his mind, but his hands jerked away from the knots. “Are
you sure… it won’t come back?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head. “Now I’m sure in
nothing. But next time I will not allow to take me that
sudden.”</p>

<p>“But you… Sir wonderer, don’t take it as
offence, but how can I be sure you are not guided by them now? When
demons possess a man, they can make him do what they like!
Sometimes he does not even know he is possessed.”</p>

<p>Oleg kept his eyes, as green as usual, on
Thomas. They were full of pain. “Sir Thomas, you deserve to be a
leader of knightly detachment! I thought you were just a bold brass
head, but you are no fool. And I am not possessed. I have no proof
of it, but if you don’t untie me I will die soon of the stopping of
blood. Your ropes are very tight, Sir Thomas.”</p>

<p>“You are too strong,” Thomas protested,
feeling guilty. He hurried to undo the knots on the wonderer’s
hands, and Oleg helped him to release the legs and body. Caringly,
Thomas tied a thick rope around the wonderer’s waist, while the
other end had been fixed beforehand on the comb. The wonderer only
smirked, glancing at the knight with respectful surprise.</p>

<p>Wincing, Oleg rubbed his swollen arms, while
Thomas kneaded his legs, blue of stopped blood. Once Thomas left it
to feed the dragon. When he came back, the wonderer asked, with a
mockery in his voice, “Why are you gorging on raw liver? Doesn’t
your religion forbid to eat anything with blood?”</p>

<p>“I am Christian, no Jew,” Thomas replied with
dignity. “Those are Jews to cut and throw away a slice of bread if
a drop of blood from their own gums gets on it!”</p>

<p>“Ah, yes,” the wonderer replied tiredly, “I
confused you Christians with Khazars… Sir Thomas, I’ve never seen
such a bold man! Until I woke and saw you sitting on the dragon’s
hump and gobbling the meat prepared for dragon!”</p>

<p>“I had no other thing to do,” Thomas said as
his excuse. “The beast flies in right direction, you sleep. No
women here, no wine, and far way to the tavern, while I am cold and
scared…”</p>

<p>“Scared? Really?” Oleg wondered. His eyes
were laughing.</p>

<p>“Really,” Thomas confessed, moved his
shoulders with a shiver. “Those are you Pagans to see plenty of
flying frogs, and I, a warrior of Christ’s host, am a stranger to
this animal!”</p>

<p>“But you are sitting on his hump and
gobbling.”</p>

<p>“A need will teach to pay no heed,” Thomas
grumbled, “as one my friend from Scythia… er… Rus’ has once
said.”</p>

<p>Oleg leaned back tiredly, resting his back on
the broad comb, his face deathly pale still. “We have already made
up for four days,” he said.</p>

<p>“Four?” Thomas was astonished. He went pink,
a faint hope flattered in heart.</p>

<p>Oleg closed his eyes, like a dead tired man.
“Look down…” he whispered. “We are flying over the loop of Don
river.”</p>

<p>“Don?” Thomas started, unable to believe his
ears. “I’ve never flied in these lands before, sir wonderer! I’m
not used to recognize them form here above… yet.”</p>

<p>“Don… but neither Anglic nor Slavic… wherever
Skolots, our common ancestors, passed they named rivers Don… that
was distorted by present living nations into Dno, Dnieper,
Dniester, Donegal…” His voice broke, he fell asleep in the middle
of the word.</p>

<p>Thomas sighed with relief: he had no wish to
confess that his neck had gone numb of superhuman efforts to keep
the head straight, to avoid a look down, into that creepy abyss.
<emphasis>Heart is scratching in boots, about to break out!</emphasis> The
valiant sir wonderer hurried too much to praise him for boldness:
how could he confess cowardice? <emphasis>I should hold the knightly honor
high.</emphasis></p>

<p>He kept glancing at the terrible horned head
crushing through the air in some three or four score steps ahead.
<emphasis>Is the dragon starting to turn head or that’s just my
imagination? And why does the corner of his predatory mouth
twitch?</emphasis></p>

<p>The wonderer woke up an hour later. His face
went pink, his lackluster eyes got some glitter in. His shoulders
shivered with cold. “We should have taken a couple of blankets…
Though we had none of those. Are we flying the same?”</p>

<p>“Northwest,” Thomas replied, struggling to
restrain his ecstatic rapture that the wonderer was awake and
available to take the bigger part of concerns on his shoulders.</p>

<p>“You know the map well,” the wonderer told
him with respect.</p>

<p>“I have no need of petty maps,” Thomas
replied haughtily but felt the hot blood rushing up to his cheeks
and stooped hastily to redo the knots on the sacks of meat. “I look
at the sun!”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas, you are a real match for ancient
heroes who flew dragons!” Oleg admired.</p>

<p>“Did they… fight mounted on dragons, like on
horses?”</p>

<p>“Exactly!”</p>

<p>With a shudder, Thomas looked at the back of
dragon’s head. He remembered that snout and those teeth. “Why did
they stop it?”</p>

<p>Oleg thought for a while, waved away
uncaringly. “People changed… Meanwhile, dragons are just big frogs
with wings: drowsy while replete and grabbing everyone without
choosing when hungry. They can’t discern allies and foes in the
battlefield.”</p>

<p>The dragon made a sudden steep turn. Cursing,
Thomas stabbed at the slit between slabs with his sword habitually,
held Oleg who leaned all his weight upon him. “I fed this fool too
well! He’s frisking…”</p>

<p>Oleg kept glancing at the angry knight
silently. The dragon made a couple of flaps, spread his wings to
the full again. Thomas screamed, went crawling on the withers to
the dagger stuck between plates: the sun shone straight into his
eyes.</p>

<p>When he leveled the dragon and returned to
the wonderer, they cuddled each other to keep the last warmth.
Thomas thought of a tent. <emphasis>No. Wind will blow it away like a
flake, and we miss the moment when dragon gets hungry.</emphasis>
Involuntarily, he touched the sacks of meat.</p>

<p>“It’s cold,” Oleg said sleepily, “so he eats
often. In heat, once a day is enough. And one bull.”</p>

<p>When it started to get warmer, which meant
the ground close, the dragon flapped its wings fiercely, and
Thomas, with his teeth clenched habitually, clutched at the horny
excruciations. At every flap his numb fingers all but unclenched,
he was now thrown up, now pressed into the bony back with force
that made his eyes pop out like a lobster’s. His guts were squeezed
outside, his fingers almost flattened… before his legs were torn
away and he hung on the fingertips and the rope, alerting
beforehand, as the next moment the dragon would jerk up and Thomas
be flung down on his hard back.</p>

<p>Finally, the wings stretched to the full,
unfolded like an elephant’s ears. Thomas was not hurled, like a
frail ship in storm, anymore. Oleg waited till it was over humbly,
as he was a wonderer and hermit. Thomas sighed with relief and
crossed himself, watching over his invisible cross staying off the
flying beast. “It’s better ahorse,” he sighed drearily. “The earth
is holy… and so solid!”</p>

<p>“And afoot, a staff in hand?” Oleg added.
“You walk slowly enough to see even bugs and butterflies, these
God’s creatures. Greet the passers-by, think of the Great Truth…
The God’s world is around: steppes, woods, fields, cows…” He wiped
off his tears caused by biting head wind.</p>

<p>Thomas at last started glancing down, into
the fathomless abyss where green bumps of mountains moved very
slowly, all but standing still. He clenched his teeth, asked in a
shaky voice, “Are you sure we made up for four days?”</p>

<p>Oleg stretched his neck, all but leaned over
the dragon. “Five,” he said thoughtfully. “And started the sixth
day.”</p>

<p>“Sixth?” Thomas gasped.</p>

<p>“The dragon rose very high,” Oleg explained.
“The dark spot moving over there is a nomadic tribe, either
Polovtsians or Kumans, of Khan Kotyan. And our dragon looks either
a lark or a falcon to them…”</p>

<p>Suddenly the giant head turned, looked at
Thomas with creepy eyes, each the size of a basin, a dim glitter of
bony excruciations over them, puffs of steam bursting out of
nostrils with noise. The dragon flung open his broad jaws, his
palate and tongue a bright purple blaze framed with sugar-white
teeth. Thomas was carried away by the sight of the creepy tunnel of
red throat, with a wet slimy glisten of its walls.</p>

<p>He felt a push on shoulder, glimpsed the
wonderer’s hand with a slice of meat. A crash of colliding rocks,
and the tunnel vanished. Thomas was faced by a dull snout of either
lark or falcon. Jaws moved for a while, then the mouth opened even
wider. Thomas regained his senses, threw several slices in, and the
dragon turned away majestically, while he continued to grind his
food evenly, like a cow grinds its cud. “Isn’t it great?” Oleg
asked with gloomy fun.</p>

<p>“A magnificent beast,” Thomas answered
earnestly. “What wonders can the Lord create! And that’s not the
most… In my journeys, I’ve seen really wonderful monsters! One of
them as tall as three bulls standing on each other, but five times
as heavy as those, his ears hanging on both sides, like leather
cloaks, and fangs in his mouth – would you believe it? – as long as
my arm, and his nose longer even than a gut. With that gut, he
plucks branches to gorge! Picks things up from the ground without
stooping and gorges them too! Would you believe that?”</p>

<p>“The world is rich of wonders,” Oleg
replied.</p>

<p>“But the most wonderful is that local people
went farther than those great heroes of yours! They can ride those
animals, plow on them, drag huge stones and thick logs. Beasts are
kept in the same way our peasants keep cows or horses: in barns,
enclosures, pastures. And they are not feed in plenty – just enough
to prevent death of starving.”</p>

<p>Beneath them, bony plates rubbed against each
other, cracked and crunched. Oleg put his hand into a slit between
bony slabs that had once been scales, to warm his numb fingers: the
dragon’s back was warm. He heard wheezing and rattling sounds
beneath: the dragon must have caught a chill in his cold damp cave.
<emphasis>At a halt, it will be good to make potion of herbs and roots…
er… trees and shrubs to cure the animal. Though no need of him
tomorrow, we may just let him go, but one should return good for
good even to a beast. It is entrusted by old gods.</emphasis></p>

<p>The sun started sinking to the west, and the
dragon was flying evenly the same. Thomas wondered how long he
would keep flying, any bird would have allowed a rest by that time,
but the wonderer could not reply: he was sleeping, leaned on the
comb. <emphasis>His invisible battle against the Secret Lords of the World
was really hard.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas spotted the first anxious move of the
rollers of dragon’s ears. Once the dragon turned his head, Thomas
started to fling slices of meat into his jaws, aiming straight into
the gaping tunnel of throat. <emphasis>Maybe his windpipe is there too.
Will he choke or not?</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon only resembled a lark in his
eating while flying, and the huge slices of meat to him were the
same as flies to a lark. The wonderer woke up, set to helping the
knight at once, though Thomas did not seem to consider his work
disgraceful: even kings in times would feed and wash their
warhorses themselves and dragons, as he believed the wonderer, once
were war mounts. “Sky… lark,” Thomas breathed out when another
slice went into dragon’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Who?” Oleg wondered.</p>

<p>Thomas hurled another blooded slice. The
dragon finally turned away, with his cheeks swollen. “A falcon
hunts in the sky but he eats on the ground. And we are throwing
flies to a skylark.”</p>

<p>Oleg hemmed, wiped his palms on the bony
plate. There was a constant move beneath, as though Thomas and Oleg
sat on flock of migrating turtles.</p>

<p>“We only have meat for one feeding!” Thomas
reminded anxiously.</p>

<p>“Let him chew that,” Oleg replied with
discontent. “Gorged like a hamster. We can see his cheeks from
behind!”</p>

<p>The dragon’s cheeks <emphasis>were</emphasis> bulging. He
chewed evenly, the wind blew saliva off the corner of his mouth,
Oleg recoiled in time, and the basket-sized drop plopped down on
the knight. Cursing, he started to disentangle from the sticky
slime, completely oblivious, in his fury, of the dragon’s flapping
wings again in a swift ascend. “Isn’t that beast tired?”</p>

<p>“Don’t know,” Oleg replied warily. “I haven’t
flown for a long time.”</p>

<p>“I look after <emphasis>my</emphasis> horse,” Thomas
reproached. “When winded, he’s no fit for a saddle.”</p>

<p>“I have no horse,” Oleg growled. “We should
take care of our <emphasis>soul</emphasis>! But we put it the last.”
Nevertheless, he looked with doubt at the dragon’s stretched neck.
The beast was flying in a crane way: legs tucked up, while the neck
and combed tail stretched in a line. “Night is soon,” Oleg said
unwillingly. “Need to find a place to spend it. And let the beast
take a breath. He may be like a horse that falls dead at a
tilt!”</p>

<p>Thomas looked down apprehensively. Wooded
hills under them looked like some marsh hummocks. “How to make him
land?.. I’ve only flown down from a horseback. And once from a
tower – a stone tower of forty feet! Down on the stone-paved
square, in my full armor.”</p>

<p>Oleg gave the knight a respectful glance,
climbed up to Thomas’s dagger, stabbed in a different place. “Hey,
Skylark! Get down to the grass. The one we call a forest.”</p>

<p>The dragon uttered a shrill scream, made a
sharp turn aside, as though a fish in water, folded his wings
suddenly and dropped – like no stone but a whole rock! – down.
Thomas’s heart stopped beating, his legs and bottom came off the
dragon back. He hung in the air, with only the rope to keep him.
Their fall got faster and faster, the air swished and screeched
around.</p>

<p>Oleg pulled the knife out hastily, his face
went white. He stabbed in a different slit, the dragon made a
slight turn but kept falling like a rock that slipped off the
mountain top. The ground rushed to meet them, tiny houses were
sprouting up, dark points turned mice, then cows.</p>

<p>Thomas struggled his heavy head up, saw the
tops of trees darting by, very close. The dragon flew over the
forest, his wings spread, a huge ugly shadow rushed before him.
Then there was a broad glade, even a small field, all in sticking
stumps and gaping pits. The dragon was driven straight onto the
stubs. Thomas felt sick, closed his eyes, and pressed himself into
the slits between plates.</p>

<p>The back beneath them suffered a sudden
terrible jerk. The wonderer swore through gritted teeth. Thomas was
hit in face, his mouth filled with blood. The rope almost tore him
in halves but kept. Thomas opened one eye. Trees were darting past
him in ten steps, as dragon ran on the ground, with his wings
advanced to reduce the speed, his breath rattling and sniffling,
his nostrils steaming. His wings lowered gradually, with a dry
rustle, and folded.</p>

<p>Oleg cut the rope with a single move. Thomas
gripped a bony protuberance with both hands, his feet clung at
another one. If he had no helmet with lowered visor on, he would
have also clutched at the dragon’s withers with his teeth. Oleg
moved his lips apart. <emphasis>Well done, knight, you hold like a mite on
a young goat</emphasis>. He clapped Thomas on shoulder.</p>

<p>Thomas suddenly came off the solid back,
turned twice while rolling down a slope, at last hit the ground and
remained lying there, with his arms wide spread, staring vacantly
in the evening sky.</p>

<p>The wonderer’s anxious face emerged over him.
“Sir Thomas! Are you all right?”</p>

<p>“I am,” Thomas croaked. “But for my being
completely well, this damned skylark should have not hatched
out!”</p>

<p>“Are you hurt?” Oleg gasped. “I seemed to
hear of you falling down from a forty-feet tower. In full armor,
into a stony yard.”</p>

<p>“I did fall!” Thomas snapped. “But not from
the very top! I climbed just three feet up before they pushed me
off.” Moaning, he got up, glanced back at the grey-green hill of a
dragon. The animal had his head advanced and laid on the ground.
His eyes were dark with tiredness, his wings, which had pushed the
knight off so uncaringly, lay on his back like old sails, the comb
completely covered by them. The long tail was still, only the very
tip twitching a bit, the sharp needles on the comb were lowered and
stiffened.</p>

<p>Thomas moved his shoulders, the bones
crunched, as though the dragon had chewed him instead of meat and
spat out.</p>

<p>“I gather brushwood, and you feed the beast,”
Oleg suggested.</p>

<p>The sacks lay where they fell, thrown off the
back by wings, in two score steps, behind the tip of dragon tail.
Thomas measured that flying lizard with his eyes, counted about
forty feet from tail to head and over forty-five the other way
round. “May I gather it?”</p>

<p>“You said you used to feed and clean your
horse!”</p>

<p>“Cleaning <emphasis>this</emphasis>? I’d rather make three
fires.”</p>

<p>Oleg, with no burden of armor on him, dragged
the remaining sacks up quickly. The dragon opened one eye a bit,
sighed with grief. Oleg knocked impatiently with the toe of his
boot on the lower jaw, as though on a door of inhospitable hut.
Lazily, the dragon opened his mouth a bit. Oleg tried to squeeze
the whole sack of meat through but failed, so he shook the meat out
before the monstrous mug. Huge nostrils started to move, then
stretched, got wide like foxholes. Oleg shoved the blooded slice
into tightly clenched lips. Reluctantly, the dragon moved his jaws
apart. Oleg thrust the rest of the meat into with force, the mouth
closed, and the tired dragon fell asleep, with his cheeks swollen
like a thrifty hamster’s.</p>

<p>Thomas kindled a bonfire, making it
providently behind the trees, in case if dragon does not like the
smoke. When Oleg came back after a short hunting, the kettle was
boiling with water. The bigger twigs had burnt down, crimson coals
twinkled invitingly.</p>

<p>Thomas took two hares from the wonderer,
shook his head. “I thought we have the aurochs liver… How much you
eat. Though <emphasis>a hermit</emphasis>!”</p>

<p>“We shouldn’t eat the dragon out,” Oleg
explained. “We have nothing to feed him tomorrow. Have you thought
of it?”</p>

<p>Thomas disemboweled the hares, threw one into
the boiling water and resolved to roast another one on coals, which
he, to tell truth, had prepared for that matter, as he knew the
wonderer. “And you?”</p>

<p>“There are whole herds grazing in the
steppes.”</p>

<p>They had their meal in silence, tired, though
all the day long they did nothing but sat on the flying dragon.
Thomas was first to hear the dry thuds of unshod hooves, threw his
spoon aside, gripped his sword. Oleg finished the soup hastily, got
up too. The bow and arrows were on his back, his sheathed sword by
the fire.</p>

<p>Some mounted men rode out onto the glade:
short, neatly built, with black hair and black eyes. Each one has a
bow behind, a strange felt hat on his head. Their horses are rather
small but look hardy and evil. Thomas counted twelve of them, and a
dense wall of riders that could be discerned at a distance…</p>

<p>The men raised their hands, cried something
out in guttural voices. One of them dismounted, walked forward
slowly, advancing his palms. Oleg nodded Thomas to stay in place,
walked slowly to meet the man. Thomas, with his hand on the hilt of
huge sword, watched Oleg tensely. The latter came up fearlessly to
the black-haired man who was all but a head shorter, they spoke in
low voices. The black-haired man pointed at the riders, even moved
his hand in the direction of those behind the trees, told Oleg
something in a fast guttural voice, with several nods at the
dragon: he slept at the other end of the glade, his mighty breath
bending the trees before, their leaves had fallen down of his loud
snoring.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back and shouted. “Sir Thomas!
Have your rest. I’ll go round to the nomad camp. Get to know news.
I haven’t been to Rus’ for a long time, and they ride just from
there.”</p>

<p>“Are you safe?” Thomas cried anxiously.
“Aren’t they Polovtsians?”</p>

<p>“They are,” Oleg replied. “Kumans! Those
Polovtsians who become our friends get the name of Kumans. When I
am back, I’ll tell you more.”</p>

<p>A horse in ornate harness, in a colored
horsecloth with gold embroidery, was led up to Oleg. The
black-haired man pointed at Thomas with finger, Oleg shook his head
negatively. He jumped into the saddle with no touch to stirrups.
“When are you back?” Thomas cried in fear.</p>

<p>“In the morning,” Oleg replied. “You sleep!”
He urged his horse, the riders galloped to meet the long shadows.
Evening came fast: before the sun sank beyond the horizon
completely, the glittering moon was followed by first stars. The
sky went dark, studded with stars from end to end: not that bright
as those in Jerusalem, but sharp and prickly. <emphasis>We need to fly
with care tomorrow, not get too high, lest we get our backs cut on
those sticking nails.</emphasis></p>

<p>He woke as though pushed. There were distant
voices, anxious horse snorting. Thomas snatched the sword from
under his head. Half-awake, he took a fighting posture, as he’d
just dreamed of the attacking chivalry of Saracen.</p>

<p>In the pale light of dawn, some scores of men
were bustling about the edge of the glade. Thomas smelled fresh
blood. One of them was distinctive by his stature and broad
shoulders. When he turned, Thomas recognized the wonderer.</p>

<p>Oleg waved his hand. “Good morning… Sir
Thomas…” His voice was feeble, he staggered, but the others riders
seemed to be treating him with friendly respect/ Thomas lowered his
sword. Soon after, all of them save the wonderer jumped on their
horses and galloped away, while the wonderer dragged himself to the
dying fire, by which the noble knight had taken his firm stand.</p>

<p>Thomas gasped. The wonderer looked exhausted,
hardly able to drag his feet. His face had become yellow, his eyes
glassy, his lips dry. He trudged up to the fire and collapsed. He
obviously felt frozen. Hurriedly, Thomas threw some dark twigs on
the dark crimson coals, blew on them, bulging his cheeks. A whole
cloud of ashes flew up, sprinkled the knight all over, but the
coals flared with bright orange flames, which leaked the twigs and
the fire blazed up.</p>

<p>Oleg jerked his shoulders, his eyes seemed to
be closing by themselves. “I’m getting too old for such things… But
nothing to be helped. I’m Pagan. A man of that old, cruel
world…”</p>

<p>“What,” Thomas cried in fear, “did those
animals do to you?”</p>

<p>Oleg moved his hand, spoke in a lifeless
voice. “There’s meat of young cows. A present… Drag it up – I can’t
even stir my finger.” His head dropped, he fell asleep while
seated. Thomas, trembling with both pity and fury, ran up to the
presents and checked them: forty sacks of juicy meat, five that
number they took with them the last time. <emphasis>And some bunches,
sweet-scented herbs. The meat is also interlaid with fragrant
leaves and whitish roots.</emphasis></p>

<p>Clenching his teeth, he fed the dragon
quickly: first threw the biggest slices into hungry jaws, then
forced the smaller ones into the mouth until the dragon growled and
covered his snout with paws. Thomas dragged the rest thirty-nine
sacks onto the back of replete dragon, tied them doubly tight to
the comb along it, stretched two rows of ropes to walk. or at least
crawl, along, put the rest of the fire down quickly, packed the
kettle into empty sack.</p>

<p>The wonderer was sitting in the same pose,
his chin rested on the chest. In times he gave a snort or a start.
Keen over the tormented man, Thomas lifted him up, shouldered and
carried carefully to the dragon who was also sleeping, full up.</p>

<p>When he was tying the wonderer as tight as
possible, lest he be blown off at flying up, Oleg came to himself
and muttered, “Thank you, Sir Thomas… You are true friend… And me
too…”</p>

<p>“What was it there?” Thomas asked
quickly.</p>

<p>The wonderer’s lips made a sluggish move.
“Wild people, you see? They have wild customs… But I’m no Christian
to recognize only the customs of my own. When in Rome, I do as
Romans do…” He tried to get asleep.</p>

<p>“Were you tortured?” Thomas asked, ready to
tear the wild Polovtsians with his bare hands for their satanic
deeds.</p>

<p>“Oh yes, I was… I said I’m getting old for
such rites… All the night long – only naked girls! Singing,
dancing, snuggling… I lost the count of them after the first two
scores. This is the land where Targitai managed his thirteenth
feat! Their chieftain wanted to say girls to you, I hardly reasoned
him out… They don’t know, wild men, that you are Christian and made
a vow of fidelity to beautiful Krizhina…”</p>

<p>“What custom is that?” Thomas asked,
dumbfounded.</p>

<p>“They are wild, I say… Bring their most
beautiful virgins for night to those considered heroes. To improve
the breed!.. And now we come flying on a dragon… So they made every
effort! Once I’ve thought it was over with girls but then saw them
dragging new ones from the camp, in such a hurry! When they grasped
I was capable of nothing more, the chieftain wanted to send them to
you again… I all but scuffled with him. Fool, he knows no
principles of Christianity… And I had to accept those ones myself
too…”</p>

<p>Thomas darkened, said through gritted teeth
in a strange voice, “Thank you, sir wonderer! I’ll never forget
this service.”</p>

<p>“Always… for friend…” Oleg went snoring, hung
in the ropes like a cheap doll with its sawdust out. Furious,
Thomas even forgot he did not knew how to raise the dragon into
air. Cursing the Kumans and his noble friend, he woke the dragon,
made him take a run, and once the dragon jumped up Thomas turned
him northwest.</p>

<p>The wonderer woke up for a moment, mumbled
with his eyes closed. “Sir Thomas, you here?.. Don’t forget to feed
Skylark… or he gobbles us both. I’ll have a little sleep, well?
Don’t forget to scratch: the fresh scar on the left of his withers
is itching. And tap him between ears with butt – he loves it… If I
don’t wake till noon, you awake me…”</p>

<p>He fell silent, his jaw dropped again. To
Thomas, he looked like a corpse who gave his life to thirty or some
other number of virgins, as he lost count of them before, and then
accepted even those whom the chieftain of Kumans was sending him,
Thomas Malton, who had seen no petticoat for several months by that
time!</p>

<p><emphasis>Damned Pagan</emphasis>, Thomas said angrily.
<emphasis>I need to discuss the principles of Christianity seriously with
him when I have an opportunity. Fool, he does not understand that
only Pagans have their soul and body as a whole, as though white
and yellow clay mixed up in the same basin. And Christians have
soul separate from body: carnal values and spiritual values. Soul
cannot respond for carnal joys, as body is sinful and soul is
godly! No sin – no repentance, no repentance – no salvation.</emphasis>
And if the Pagan understood nothing, as the doctrine of Christ was
for selected few, Thomas would tell him resolutely and firmly to
leave the judgment of Christian values to him. <emphasis>Just look at this
goer-in-everything-himself! Smells like a barrel of wine. Must have
drunk for two of us as well, a viper…</emphasis></p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 38</p>

<p>The wonderer was asleep so fast that could
hardly be awaken not only by dinner but by supper. Well if he wakes
at dawn… Thomas sighed, took the dagger. The plates beneath him
were moving, coming close, rubbing against each other creepily.
Once their collision made a bony splinter to flew apart and hurt
his cheek bleeding. He touched the scratch, asked Our Lady in a
whisper to leave that small scar be. Later, back in Britain, he
would swear on the Holy Book, the Nail of the Cross of the Lord and
anything else they would offer him that he got that wound from a
dragon as large as a mountain!</p>

<p>Obeying the prick, dragon turned northwest,
and Thomas stiffened of waiting again. Gradually, he accustomed
himself to glance down. Though his soul would froze with bodily
fear each time, he could watch the migrating masses of mounted
hosts, countless herds. Sometimes he spotted white tents:
Polovtsians build no cities, as the wonderer had told him, only
ruin and destroy the cities of others, live in yurts and covered
wagons. They cross streams on the go and wade across large rivers.
Only once Thomas saw them swimming across a broad river: the water
was scattered with the points of swimmers, with many rafts of logs
and clusters of empty leather skins tied together among them.</p>

<p>Far below the dragon’s belly, rives and
groves floated by. As close Thomas peered, he could see not a
single city, either big or small, no village, no hamlet, not even a
tiny settlement of one or two houses: only hooded carts of nomads
surrounded by numerous herds of cattle and horses.</p>

<p>At noon Thomas woke the wonderer up
gloatingly, as he had asked for it. Almost at the same time, the
dragon had a wish to eat, and the half-awake wonderer together with
the knight flung fat slices of meat hastily into the red furnace.
The dragon kept chewing. Finally, he turned away, but then decided
to fill up the cheek pouch on the other side. Thomas pretended not
to notice it, the wonderer threw bleeding slices up alone, then
wiped his hands for a long time on the lifted comb that looked like
a tall bony fence of sharp stakes.</p>

<p>By evening Oleg made the dragon descend. They
landed on the bank of a narrow river that ran jumping on stones,
its bed cut in the crumbling rocks, so unusual in the steppes, as
flat as an endless table.</p>

<p>That time Thomas jumped off a moment before
the huge wings folded with a thundering sound on the back, pressing
down the bristled comb. He rolled over head, his iron clanging, all
but ran into own sword. The wonderer followed the dragon who lay
down on the bank and lapped the water greedily. Oleg shook out meat
from two sacks near the awful snout.</p>

<p>Thomas limped into shrubs to gather
brushwood, as the sun was sinking to the horizon. When he came back
with a first armful, a tiny fire already burnt on the bank: the
wonderer lit it on dry grass blades and wooden splinters washed
ashore by waves. In hundred steps upstream, there were loud
splashes, hits on water, as though the river was battered with
logs. The dragon, after having gobbled half of the meat and thrown
the rest around swinishly, sat up to his belly in the water, almost
blocking the river, his outspread wings bent by the current. The
seething water ran over wings and paws, with spikes looking out of
the foam, like sharp pales in the city wall. The dragon bowed down
to the very water, peered very closely in, holding his breath, then
suddenly stroke with both paws, raising a cloud of spray. Thomas
dropped dry twigs with a crash, glancing apprehensively at the
strange animal. “What’s he doing?”</p>

<p>“Fishing,” Oleg muttered.</p>

<p>“Are you jesting?.. Fish to him is small like
flies to you.”</p>

<p>“Or you,” Oleg parried. “Do <emphasis>you</emphasis> only
hunt for food? Or for the joy of it too?.. Dragon has a pleasure to
recall his childhood. When he was small, he lived in water… Fish
was a match to him then. A match or bigger.”</p>

<p>The dragon jumped with squeaks. His fat
bottom twitched, prominent frog eyes flashed. His forepaws were
groping under the water, his claws so wide apart and out at full
length that it all but made Thomas’s legs give way, and own armor
seemed to the knight no thicker than maple leaves. “Probably,” Oleg
said, thinking of some other matters, “he <emphasis>is</emphasis> small still…
Dragons live for thousands of years. The one two hundred years old
is a teenager…”</p>

<p>The teenager, with a terrible scream that
made the banks tremble, was pulling out of the water some
fluttering log with fins, Oleg hardly recognized a sheatfish in it.
Backing, the dragon stepped on his own tail and fell but kept the
sheatfish, floundered with it in the water for a while, raising
clouds of spray and shaking the ground, flung it hastily far away
on the bank and rushed to the river again. He bustled about, with a
passion of hunting, plunged his head into the water up to the ears,
peering at the rocky bottom, and when a strong wave rolled overhead
he did not recoiled in fear but plunged deeper in excitement: only
his spread comb and fat bottom remained over the water.</p>

<p>Twice he threw on the bank a hundred-year-old
pike, which looked like a green mossy drowned log, while the
miraculous sheatfish, a giant Oleg had never seen before, was
writhing heavily, bending, sliding gradually down the slope to the
water. The dragon jumped fussily, spanked with giant paws, trying
to claw the prey, snatched it with jaws. Meanwhile, the sheatfish,
feeling the water close, bent his body twice with its last strength
and its tail, forked like a mermaid’s, touched the water. The
sheatfish leapt in the air, plopped down into the shallow water,
and crawled on, winding his body and leaving a deep trench, which
was buried with sand immediately. The sheatfish was getting deeper
with every moment. Finally, the wave was cut by a dorsal fin, which
looked like a small dragon’s comb. It darted to the middle of the
river and vanished.</p>

<p>“Fool,” Oleg grumbled. He fingered his
charms, casting vacant glances at the dragon’s comb spread with
excitement. “His pikes are also creeping to water… What an offended
roar he will make!”</p>

<p>“May I keep the pikes?” Thomas said
anxiously, but Oleg heard sympathy in the knight’s voice too.
“We’ll need less meat for him.”</p>

<p>“Keep them,” Oleg growled. His eyes were
vacant, he kept fingering charms, his lips moved, whispering either
prayers or spells.</p>

<p>Thomas rushed to the fishing spot, not afraid
of the wet dragon: no savage beast anymore but a fervent fisher
whom the knight could understand as he was one himself. With
effort, he dragged the heavy pikes far from the water. Wet and
covered with slime, they writhed fervently, snapped with toothy
jaws. Thomas had a hard time helping the luckless fisher: the pikes
turned out to be tenacious of life, though both had marks of claws
on their heads. When he tried to grab the first one by tail (it was
dangerous to seize by gills a creature with crocodile jaws and
inch-long teeth), the pike’s mighty jerk threw him down on the
ground, with an iron thunder, the wet sand mixed with fish slime
hurled into his eyes. Swearing like a Templar, he stunned both with
his iron fists, finishing the dragon’s work, dragged them on the
dry as far as he could.</p>

<p>The dragon got out, put his paws apart, shook
himself like a dog. Crayfish and pebbles flew in all directions,
along with clouds of sand and water. He had the third pike clenched
in teeth. He trotted on the bank merrily, a mischievous glitter in
his eyes, even the mails on his snout a bit apart. As he spotted
Thomas dragging a pike away by tail, he stopped abruptly. The lower
jaw dropped, the fresh-caught pike plopped wetly down on the
ground, leapt twice, splashed into the shallow water near the bank,
its body bent forcefully once more and darted into the depth.</p>

<p>Thomas dropped his pike, cowered low of the
terrible roar. The dragon yelled, making the ground tremble, trees
bend, and leaves fall on the ground as though from shaken branches.
His eyes got creepy and bloodshot, the huge comb reared from the
withers to the tip of his tail.</p>

<p>The wonderer glanced back at the roar.
“What’s up him?” Thomas cried to him in fear.</p>

<p>“Where did you put sheatfish?” Oleg cried
back.</p>

<p>“He thinks I ate it?”</p>

<p>Oleg stood up, cupped his hand at his
forehead. “Where’s it then?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t touch it at all!” Thomas shouted in
fury.</p>

<p>Oleg watched him with great doubt. “And where
were you dragging that pike?”</p>

<p>Suddenly the dragon rushed forward, in short,
fussy jumps. His eyes were fixed on Thomas, jaws started to open,
with a glitter of teeth. Thomas stood as though enchanted, watching
the horrible beast coming on him, when a desperate scream cut his
ears, “To the cleft! The cleft near you! On the left!!!”</p>

<p>Obeying, Thomas jumped to the left, over a
fat pike, fell into the cleft, rolled away from the entrance. At
once it went dark, the rock trembled of a heavy blow, the awful
roar of frantic dragon slashed his ears. The beast tried to shove
his snout into the narrow slit, bellowed of disappointment. Thomas
clung fast into the corner, out of his strength, gasping for air
the stink of dragon’s breath, his head cracking of the terrible
roar.</p>

<p>When the dragon fell silent for a moment,
drawing in the air for next scream, Thomas jerked his head up,
looked around. He was trapped, no other way out. The dragon gave a
dreadful roar, tried to put his paw into the cleft. Thomas felt his
hair stirring under the helmet, as the monstrous claws scratched
the stone floor in just a step. Somehow the dragon managed a turn,
his claws all but reached the knight. Thomas flattened himself on
the wall, watching with terror the paw scratching stone in two
inches from his leg. He glanced back in despair, but that cave was
a solid stone hollowed out: no chink for a mouse to get in or
out!</p>

<p>When Thomas could not anymore discern whether
it was dark of the beast’s body screening the light or the starry
night sky, he tried a look out. He barely had time to recoil: the
monstrous paw covered the cleft immediately, pebbles crunched on
the diamond-hard claws. The horrible animal kept guarding his
prey!</p>

<p>He heard steps, then the wonderer’s sleepy,
yawning voice. “Is that you, Sir Thomas?.. Sleep if you must. Let
dragon cool down. Don’t re-open his sores.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer!” Thomas cried nervously. “I
give the word of noble knight’s honor: I didn’t touch that
sheatfish!”</p>

<p>The dragon growled menacingly on the other
side of the cleft. A monstrous paw screened the stars, hit on the
crevice with a thunder. Small pebbles rang on the knight’s armor.
Thomas recoiled.</p>

<p>He heard the wonderer’s voice, peaceful and
comforting. “I believe you, actually… Though the sheatfish
<emphasis>did</emphasis> disappear…”</p>

<p>“You think,” Thomas cried in terror, “I ate
that rotten sheatfish?”</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas!”</p>

<p>“Well, no rotten, I was carried too far about
it… But I am a paladin of Crusade, noble Sir Malton…”</p>

<p>“In the excitement of hunting… er… A noble
passion… But I said nothing of you having eaten it. Though both of
us, dragon and I, saw you stealing the pike.”</p>

<p>“<emphasis>Stealing?</emphasis>”</p>

<p>“Everyone has his weaknesses, sir knight.
Everyone is sinful, God forgive them. And the dragon… he will
forget if not forgive.”</p>

<p>“Forget?”</p>

<p>“Dragons have memory like a sieve,” Oleg
explained. The dragon’s roaring was all the softer, as though he
tried to fathom the meaning of human words or the wonderer
scratched him behind ears. “In the morning he can’t recall the day
before. So he’ll forget you making off with his sheatfish.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t touch it!”</p>

<p>“Er… he, as well as I, saw you dragging away
his pike. Probably he has seen even more of it. We Rodians consider
it a sin to deceive even a beast, but you Christians have nothing
in the way it’s supposed to be…”</p>

<p>He heard the wonderer settling by the distant
fire, which crackled with coals in silence. Lately, Thomas recalled
the wonderer, though immersed in his deep thoughts, <emphasis>could</emphasis>
have seen the sheatfish getting into the river by itself. Oleg had
even advised him, Thomas Malton, to save pikes for that ungrateful
fool! But now the wonderer could hardly be reached by Thomas’s
cries: he slept like a log, while the dragon breathed evenly at
hand, as though a heavy tide coasting in: it only filled the cave
not with fresh sea breeze but with a heavy smell of rotting meat
stuck in dragon’s teeth. Thomas could see not a single star: the
beast leaned his side on the cleft, blocking the way out even in
his sleep.</p>

<p>Slowly, Thomas slid down the wall on the
floor, trying not to ring his armor. The dragon’s snoring was even
and mighty. Unwittingly, Thomas lapsed into a short and troubled
dream, as he thought it to be.</p>

<p>Thomas woke of the bright sun shooting its
fiery arrows straight in his eyes. He heard splashes, roaring,
mighty slapping on water from outside his small cave.</p>

<p>Slowly, with apprehension, Thomas came to the
entrance. The dragon was fishing excitedly in hundred steps from
the cave, and the wonderer, naked to the waist, sat by the dead
fire, which was only a black burnt circle in place of coals. He was
doing a diligent needlework on the wolfskin jack lying on his
laps.</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer,” Thomas called quietly from
his cleft, “good morning!”</p>

<p>“Morning,” the wonderer answered vacantly.
His eyebrows were knitted on the bridge of his nose. “How have you
slept?”</p>

<p>“Thanks,” Thomas replied politely. He moved
out a bit, measured the distance towards the excited fisher with
his eyes. “How is our horse?”</p>

<p>“Skylark? He seems to be well. Fishing till
dawn. They say it’s really the best time for fishing.”</p>

<p>“It is,” Thomas confirmed respectfully. “But
what about the sheatfish?”</p>

<p>“There’s only one way to find out.”</p>

<p>Thomas came out of the cleft. “Sir wonderer,”
he spoke with dignity, “in your godly thoughts, you have missed it
were <emphasis>you</emphasis> who advised me to help poor animal save his fish!
Well, for my kind deed… as my friend pilgrim of Rus’ would say, my
lard was spread on my own skin!”</p>

<p>The wonderer lowered his needle, his eyebrows
flew up to the middle of his forehead. “Really?.. I have some vague
memories of that. It seems you truly haven’t stolen that sheatfish…
Indeed, that would be too much even of a Christian. Though
sheatfish <emphasis>did</emphasis> vanish… Well, well, let’s leave it. God sees
everything, especially your Christian god spying on everyone,
jealous of no leaf to fall without his will, not a single hair of
one’s head…”</p>

<p>Thomas approached the fire, nodded at the
humped back with reared comb. “Won’t he devour me?”</p>

<p>The wonderer thought for a while, scratched
the back of his head with five, shrugged. “Off chance he
won’t.”</p>

<p>Doomed, Thomas sat down near the wonderer.
“Off chance,” “we must go,” “it will come right,” and also “kusim,”
a mysterious spell with which the wonderer went right through it
and won. Thomas tried to say that magic formula secretly himself,
but it had no effect on him, the knight of West: one definitely
needed to have a mysterious Russian soul, which is not to be
measured against other men’s yardsticks, to say “off chance” and go
on with a blind faith in own good luck…</p>

<p>The dragon darted suddenly along the bank,
jumped up to a steep. Sitting in the hollow water, he started to
claw out clots of yellow clay, with pebbles and grass, snatch them
with huge jaws, swallow hastily, tear out new ones, trying to get
those without stones, roots, and mud. “What is he doing?” Thomas
whispered anxiously.</p>

<p>“Glutted with fish,” Oleg dismissed.
Efficiently, he made a knot on the strand, bit a piece off,
examined his work with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“But why clay?”</p>

<p>“He has a stomachache. One is helped from it
by coals, another by clay… Let him have it. Today we’ll need to fly
up to the evening.” He took the flint out of his bag. With a sigh,
Thomas went for brushwood. He heard mighty smack on water and roar
from the river again. <emphasis>The dog had some grass, as the wonderer
said, but soon grew hungry for meat.</emphasis></p>

<p>After a quick hearty breakfast, Oleg
collected the slices of roast meat into a separate bag, then
emptied the full kettle of thick viscous broth into the dragon’s
mouth. The animal bellowed, turned his snout away, put his paw in
jaws, trying to rack that filth away, choked, his eyes got five
times bigger, about to burst. “Swallowed,” Oleg said with
satisfaction. “Alright… He’ll sweat profusely but his illness be
gone, like water off a duck’s back. Get on Skylark, Sir Thomas! Now
he spreads his wings.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The dragon dashed over clouds, like a stone
shot of a catapult. Oleg and Thomas, tied firmly, were clinging to
the comb, wrapping themselves in cloaks: the head wind was blowing
off the last drops of warmth.</p>

<p>Thomas, despite his chattering teeth, would
let his head down often and look below with a quiver. In the
grey-green abyss, there were numberless mounted hosts moving and
white spots of yurts among them, millions of those, and swarming
about, as though it were billions of ants. “Polovtsians?” he
asked.</p>

<p>“Pechenegs,” Oleg answered without looking
there. “Their last attack on Rus’.”</p>

<p>“The last wife of priest, as one my friend
wonderer says…”</p>

<p>“It’s really last. They got between the
hammer and the anvil. Propped up by Polovtsians – new enemies to
Rus’.”</p>

<p>“How will it?..”</p>

<p>“As it always was. Many of them came, and
more to come. Off chance it comes right…”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced at the wonderer’s gaunt face
with ardent sympathy. He undertook to an exorbitant feat: to find
the Truth that will end all the unfairness in the world at once.
Meanwhile, the triumphant faith of Christ came to his native land,
and he turned a persecuted outcast!</p>

<p>“One good thing,” Oleg said with enthusiasm,
“we won’t need to cross the lands of Polovtsians, Pechenegs,
Berendeys! To tell the truth, I had my heart in heels about that. I
don’t know whether we would pass…”</p>

<p>The dragon got flapping abruptly. Thomas was
pressed on the slabs, his body filled with lid, even his heart
struggled to keep pounding. Oleg sat still, like a stake driven in
the flying beast’s back, fingered his charms, closed his eyes,
froze up. His face looked dead, and the cold of fear in Thomas’s
soul turned an icy block of despair, terror, and doom<emphasis>. The
Secret Seven must be enraged. Put all business aside to search for
us.</emphasis> They lost the trace when the two friends got underground,
then found the wonderer for a moment, but the dragon was flying
fast and they lost him again… <emphasis>But they will find and revenge the
death of Baruk, the adept of black magic who sold his soul to
Devil. Now they know exactly who killed that friend of theirs: the
crusader, devoted knight of the Holy Virgin, and the wise wonderer,
priest of old gods, some of whom, probably, the Savior did not
precipitate into Hell as demons but elevated to angels by his
throne!</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas managed to fall asleep, waking for a
moment only for the dragon’s sharp ascend and only in the first
hour. Afterwards he’d only puff in his sleep, fighting the strange
heaviness, frown, and when the dragon spread his wings and soared
Thomas would break into a happy smile, definitely dreaming of
Krizhina and wedding rings.</p>

<p>The days are long in summer but even they end
yielding to night. The sun started its way down to the horizon when
Oleg stirred, took the dagger in hand. Thomas moved his shoulders.
He felt deadly tiredness in every move of the wonderer.</p>

<p>The bony plates gave a quiver, came closer,
all but trapping Thomas’s leg. The dragon turned his wings a bit,
the whistling of wind grew thinner. As Oleg moved the dagger hilt,
the dragon turned obediently, as a spurred horse. Thomas saw a
hilly plain, a calm broad river flowing across it. On the other
bank, a wonderful city towered on the hills: a colossal city, light
and ornate, in golden towers and church cupolas that glittered in
the red sunset so bright that his eyes watered, as though he looked
at the sun. “Kiev!” Oleg said with grim pride.</p>

<p>“The capital city of Scythia?”</p>

<p>“You may call it Rus’,” Oleg allowed.</p>

<p>The dragon went down abruptly. Thomas
clutched unwillingly at the comb: a moment before he was flattening
under own weight, like the sheatfish that all but caused a quarrel
with the dragon, and now he became as light as a bull bladder blown
up by the children of common folk. Thomas held on involuntarily,
despite the ropes and belt keeping him firmly, as he’d checked
himself. “Where are we to land?” he shouted to the wonderer through
the noise of the wind. “The streets are narrow!”</p>

<p>“To Kiev on a dragon?” Oleg amazed.</p>

<p>Thomas looked aside shamefully. <emphasis>How fast
we get used to wonders! Yesterday I trembled with fear but today
forgot I’m not on the back of a mighty, strong warhorse!</emphasis></p>

<p>The dragon spread his wings, approaching the
ground slowly. In hundred steps above the rocky surface he even
made a sluggish flap of membranous sails to soften his fall. His
outstretched paws hit against the hard ground resiliently. He went
running, moving its paws up and down, with a loud clatter of claws.
The spread wings rested on the thick air, after two score sazhens
he stopped</p>

<p>Thomas and Oleg, ready beforehand, climbed
deftly down the spiky side. They were on the bank of the colossal
river, rocky mountains on their right: old, crumbling, gaping with
fissures, gapes, caves. Their tops were green with pines, hazels,
white-barked birch trees. In two versts away, a small river flowed
into Dnieper. Oleg nodded at it. “Pochayna<sup>25</sup>,”
he said with displeasure. “There Dobrynya killed the last serpent
who lived in these mountains!” His face went dark as a
thundercloud.</p>

<p>“Don’t be sad,” Thomas told him with care.
“We’ve brought another one to breed!”</p>

<p>“You guessed right. Pochayna left a terrible
memory: the place where Prince Vladimir renounced even his name and
became Basil, where he baptized Kiyans, who were then called
Kievins, with force, ordered them to forget Russian names and take
foreign ones instead…”</p>

<p>The dragon, whom the wonderer continued to
call a serpent, shook his head, looking around, stared with
lackluster eyes at the big waves rolling ashore, turned and crept
slowly to the gapes of caves.</p>

<p>“He’s settled,” Thomas sighed with relief. “I
was afraid he’d rush fishing again!”</p>

<p>“Now he will bear no sight of fish for a
week!”</p>

<p>Stones cracked under the heavy belly, the
comb now subsided, now reared again. The serpent quickened his run,
plunged at full speed into the biggest cave, backed at once,
shaking his head, climbed with more caution into another one. His
spiky tail flashed and vanished in.</p>

<p>“I hope,” Thomas said, “he won’t disturb the
holy prayers of local hermits.” Oleg stared into the water of
Dnieper, dark in the twilight. He seemed to have forgotten the
dragon, his fingers running over the charms without stop, his eyes
anxious.</p>

<p>Thomas glanced the place over with an eye of
warrior and crusader. Pity he could not fly the dragon straight to
Britain, it shouldn’t have taken more time than a day and night.
<emphasis>But sir wonderer is where he wanted to get: those are roofs of
his native city. Above all, no dragon will fly farther north, which
is for the better in the end. Who of British knights would defeat
such a beast? They’ll go into battle one by one and fall on the
field… Let him live here till autumn. When cold comes, he will
follow wild geese into his native warm lands.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas touched the bag with Holy Grail – it
had become as a habitual gesture of his as fingering charms to the
wonderer – and followed his friend. The huge sword in well-fitted
scabbard seemed rooted in the wonderer’s back, and the compound bow
and quiver of arrows were fastened tightly with wide belts. Thomas
tied up his belt on the go, lest his sword ring on the armor, came
up with his friend and walked shoulder to shoulder with him.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 39</p>

<p>The sun had hidden below the edge of the
earth long before, the dusk thickened. The heads of silver nails,
which the Lord nailed the firmament with, were growing brighter the
darkening sky. The waning moon got an evil glint, and Thomas
recalled inopportunely, with a shudder of shoulders, that it was
the sun to dead men who rise from their graves at night and roam
the roads, to vampires and other unchristian things.</p>

<p>They walked along a narrow path winding under
the steep bank. A thundering tide, as though a sea one, rolled in a
shore. Far in the river, there was a glimpse of a bare back, a
laughing face, then a splash of big fish tail and the strange
creature vanished.</p>

<p>They came to a broad moorage made of thick
logs driven into the river bottom and thinner logs atop them:
glittering, tightly fitted, with trimmed sides. Those were new,
good moorings.</p>

<p>Oleg nodded at a house of logs that stood on
a steep hill. “The house of ferryman… The ferry comes from the
other bank at dawn tomorrow. You’ll cross for Kiev. That means
Britain at your hand: across Czech, Germany, and France.”</p>

<p>“And you?”</p>

<p>The wonderer gave no reply, made his way
slowly up the slope to the house. Thomas shrugged. His belly was
rumbling: he ate nothing all the way they made on dragon’s back,
and then the serpent took away on his back all the remaining
thirty-eight sacks of meat – the gift of savage steppe dwellers.
<emphasis>The ropes will burst in a narrow cave, sacks drop down. Enough
for the dragon to eat for a long time. The wonderer thought out
everything: he only shouldn’t have judged of some peculiarities of
Christian face. We could have earned eighty sacks of meat instead
of forty…</emphasis></p>

<p>There was a loud croak within his belly, a
stir of guts demanding meat. Hastily, Thomas drove away the
thoughts of food and young Polovtsian maidens, came up to the house
of logs. It looked blind, with windows covered with no shutters but
thick planks from inside.</p>

<p>Oleg walked along the wall, holding on the
logs, feeling and patting them. His face looked strange. They heard
a big dog in his kennel barking loudly, a menacing clang of his
chain.</p>

<p>“Let’s go,” Thomas said. “Want to spend a
night here? It is warm. We can have it on the moorings.”</p>

<p>“Wait…” Oleg groped about the windowsill,
brought some parcel hastily to his eyes, sank down on the ground
with a happy sob, leaning his back on the wall. “Home!.. Great Rod,
I’m at home!”</p>

<p>Thomas caught him, helped him up his feet, as
the dog started creeping out of his warm kennel, snarling. They
went back to the moorage, Oleg sat down on logs, unfolded the
parcel. Thomas gulped down: on wide burdock leaves, there was a
dark round loaf of rye bread, two slices of meat, half a dozen
onions. “Your charms told you that?” he asked with great
respect.</p>

<p>Oleg broke the bread, offered Thomas. “They
had.”</p>

<p>Thomas shook his head. “I need no stolen
food.”</p>

<p>“Fool. It was left to us.”</p>

<p>“Sir wonderer… who save the Secret Seven
could know we are here?”</p>

<p>“Rus’ knows. We’re in Rus’ already, see?..
The surest sign is the bread on windowsills. We have a custom of
leaving some food to beggars, outcasts, travelers, pilgrims. At
daytime hosts would give it himself, and when they go to sleep they
leave it on windowsills.”</p>

<p>Thomas all but snatched the bread from him,
dug his teeth in it, growling. The hunk of bread was dry. It would
have been fed to pigs or goats and prospering hosts would bake a
new one, but to the travelers even that dry bread tasted better
than king’s meal. “Wonderful custom,” he agreed with his mouth
full. “What’s the name of this country, you say?”</p>

<p>Big fish splashed in the water, a broad path
of moonlight silver led from the moorings to the other bank. They
sat on the end of the moorage, their feet dangling. The wonderer
swayed his foot, Thomas looked with disapproval – swaying your feet
is swaying demons on it – but said nothing. The wonderer’s face was
strangely grim, though he was back to his city!</p>

<p>Thomas stripped off his armor: his body was
itching all over. The dark water, warmed up during the day,
welcomed him. He washed sweat and dust off joyfully, scratched his
skin with strong nails, groaned through gritted teeth. As the dark
dirt came off, a white spot got visible on his right shoulder.</p>

<p>“You love water, descendant of Pelop…” Oleg
muttered with a strange note in his voice.</p>

<p>“What is Pelop?” Thomas grunted. “I’m worn
out with your impious hints! And you keep dropping more and more of
them.”</p>

<p>“Pelop,” Oleg spoke in a pompous drawl,
definitely imitating someone, “was a hero, a son of Tantalus who
killed his son and served to gods as the best of all courses. That
was the time of such customs and such gods… But gods suddenly got
angry: they stopped eating human flesh a day before… The father of
Zeus would eat it but Zeus himself would not, only the flesh of
animals… So the gods told Hermes to bring poor Pelop back to life.
Hermes collected the meat and boiled it again in the same pot. And
Pelop came out, even more beautiful, that’s the way of it… but one
of his shoulders was missing. It was gobbled by Demeter, in her
noble brooding and grief for her lost daughter. But Hephaestus was
also a guest there, so he made a new shoulder of ivory bone. Since
that, all descendants to Pelop have this white spot on their
shoulder.”<sup>26</sup></p>

<p>Thomas stopped, waist-deep in the water,
listened but frowned, just in case. <emphasis>The wonderer’s speaking of
some Pagan. A Pagan – but a hero too.</emphasis> “I saw some other man
having this spot,” he said warily. “In the Holy Land… I’m afraid
that was a leader of Saracen!”</p>

<p>“So what?” Oleg wondered. “Pelop has traveled
a lot over the world.”</p>

<p>“Did Polovtsians live among Saracen in those
times?” Thomas asked sarcastically. “I will never forget you those
Kumans…”</p>

<p>“Hardly they did, but good customs live
everywhere.”</p>

<p>Thomas frowned up, feeling hurt. “Paganism!”
he grunted. “Some Pelop… I am Malton, no Pelop. What he did
else?”</p>

<p>“What life made him to,” Oleg said
composedly. “Became a king, but then Il, the king of Troy, all but
captured him in his kingdom, Pelop had to flee him by sea. In
Greece, he wooed Hippodameia, but her father made it a condition
that her husband must outdistance him in chariot racing. The father
either had a man’s interest in her or was foretold to die of his
son-in-law… In a word, Pelop incited the king’s driver to replace
by stealth the bronze linchpin with a wax one. When the chariots
rushed on, the king gave a head start to his rival, as he always
did, and started to come up to spear his back… To put it shorter,
his chariot overturned and the king was a bulky and very heavy man,
so he got hurt. To his very death! The driver came asking Pelop for
what he’d promised him, including the wedding night of his bride,
but Pelop pushed the fool off into the sea. While falling down,
that man cursed all the posterity of Pelop.”</p>

<p>Thomas scratched the dirt off all the slower,
listening. “I can believe in the curse. That may be why the two of
us got into such scrapes. But one of my own ancestors killing a man
treacherously? Even a fool? No. I am Malton.”</p>

<p>“As you like,” the wonderer said
indifferently. “The curse haunted all of his posterity, especially
Atreus and Thyestes… Haven’t you heard of them? By the way, Pelop
spread his rule over all the southern Greece, or Apia, so it was
re-named after him – Pelop’s Isle. Or Peloponnesus.”</p>

<p>Thomas pricked up his ears. “Well,” he said
warily, “maybe he <emphasis>was</emphasis> a distant ancestor of Malton
family…”</p>

<p>“He was also the founder of Olympic games,”
the wonderer added.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“A sort of games.”</p>

<p>“Pagan games? No. Pelop was none of my
ancestors.”</p>

<p>“A sort of knightly jousting. And he also was
the first champion.”</p>

<p>The knight’s honest, half-washed face
displayed inward struggle. Oleg put the remaining onions down for
Thomas, got up. His voice was heavy. “You have enough gold coin to
buy a horse in Kiev. The road ahead is relatively safe. Across
countries not so wild as those we passed.”</p>

<p>Thomas got out hastily, pulled his knitted
clothing on his wet body, climbed into his armor. Only then he
looked in the wonderer’s green eyes, which now were dark like two
forest lakes. “And you?”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head. “I need nothing in Kiev.
I’m a hermit, a cave dweller, and all the caves are on <emphasis>this</emphasis>
bank.”</p>

<p>They embraced, then the wonderer turned round
and walked away hastily. In silence, Thomas watch his tall figure
wear thin gradually in the moonlight. A last flash of sparkles on
the polished sword hilt, and he vanished in the dark.</p>

<p>Thomas felt miserable, though in his nomadic
life of knight errant he had parted with more than one fine friend.
Some died, other settled in the bestowed lands, someone came back
to his native castle, another left in the same way: after a short
embrace and a wish of good luck, to recall his old friend and far
lands briefly some day when he is old.</p>

<p>With a sigh, Thomas sat down on the edge of
moorings again. He had no more hunger, so he sighed again, put the
remnants of bread and meat down on the broad soft leaves, which
looked like elephant’s ears. <emphasis>I need to take a first ferry to the
city, buy a horse, or better two, and hurry across civilized
countries to come back by Saint Boromir’s Day. Due to the dragon
serpent, I made half a way in two days and nights and now I have at
least a week of time left!</emphasis></p>

<p>The night was leaving slowly, the eastern
edge went slightly red. The knight’s eyes, accustomed to the dark,
discerned the most delicate hues.</p>

<p>He seemed to hear a creak of logs behind.
Glad of the wonderer’s coming back for some forgotten thing, he
wheeled round abruptly. A flash in eyes, then a tight loop fell
down on his shoulders. Thomas seized his sword, felt a pound in
head, dropped the blade and collapsed prone on the wet logs.</p>

<p>He came to all but at once, tried to jump up
but managed only a twitch, as he was tied up firmly into a likeness
of caterpillar. Some dim shapes moved over Thomas In the twilight
of dawn. He discerned voices. “I’d rather kill him… Knife in back,
that for his sort!” – “You afraid?” – “An’ you? No me face such man
for all gold on earth!”</p>

<p>The sound of steps got closer. Thomas jerked
up his head with effort, twisted with sharp pain in the back of it.
Before his face, there were high hunting boots, a dim glitter of
spurs. He turned his head, clenching his teeth not to let a moan
out.</p>

<p>A familiar voice, strangely hissing, came
from above. “Well, Sir Thomas… what would you say now?” A strange
man stood over him, resting on one leg. His sight made Thomas
tremble all over and froze his blood. The man had a hump, his left
shoulder higher than the right one, both arms in fresh scars.
Instead of left hand, he had a small red stamp with white
protruding bone. His clothes were baggy, his head hid beneath a
helmet completely.</p>

<p>“God keeps patience for long,” Thomas
croaked, “but he <emphasis>does</emphasis> strike, Sir Gorvel!”</p>

<p>“He strikes best who strikes last,” Gorvel’s
husky voice rustled from behind his iron mask.</p>

<p>“Let’s kill him <emphasis>now</emphasis>!” a different man
said anxiously. “I’m afraid.”</p>

<p>“A member of the Counsel of Secret Seven is
to come,” Gorvel hissed. “To see whether he has some magic
powers.”</p>

<p>“But it was one went away who had magic!”</p>

<p>“I can hear the steps of her!” Gorvel snapped
in a husky angry voice. “You may kill him straight after.”</p>

<p>The warrior gave Thomas a kick. “At last you
parted with your friend!” he said maliciously, twisting his mouth.
“You, iron-bound scarecrow, don’t know he was the only match for
me, Black Warrior. Once he injured me, left this scar on my face,
but it was just because my foot slipped… He destroyed the Khazarian
host I was leading against King Rumal… Killed ten of my brothers,
lords of eastern lands. Only I and my elder brother Karganlyk
survived… You were a fool to part with him!”</p>

<p>Through the lapping of Dnieper waves, he
heard patting of feet. A small woman in a man’s cloak emerged on
the moorings. The hood was pulled over her eyes, but she moved it
back on her shoulders at once. She was fragile, her face pale and
innocent, her eyebrows raised in surprise, an offended look in her
big brown eyes. Thomas wished to shield her from danger
immediately, to save her even from the morning chill and river
dampness.</p>

<p>She cast a brief glance at him, spoke in a
low husky voice, which made Thomas’s heart ache sweetly. “No need
of it… but thank you, all the same. Where’s the cup, Gorvel?”</p>

<p>Groaning, Gorvel stooped to pick Thomas’s
bag. “Here it is!”</p>

<p>She took the bag with no look within, made a
nod in the side of Thomas. “Why is he here?”</p>

<p>“For you to see,” Gorvel replied in a very
respectful tone. “He is too viable, strangely viable… Does he have
any magic?”</p>

<p>The small woman looked closely at Thomas. He
felt invisible fingers running on his chest, shivered in fright
when those fingers reaching under his heavy armor, froze in fear
while her fingertips examined his heart and brain quickly… Her eyes
went dark, she spoke out in a restrained voice. “No magic. But
immense courage and will!”</p>

<p>Clasping the bag tightly, she started a walk
on the moorings back. “Your Might,” Gorvel said respectfully but
with a well-hidden mockery in his voice, “we could leave
together…”</p>

<p>She glanced over at him coldly. Her voice was
razor-sharp. “Gorvel, you are not even a grandmaster! You are still
closer to a plain hangman than to the members of Secret Seven!”</p>

<p>Gorvel trembled, fell down on his knees. The
woman left. Thomas caught a last glimpse of her straight back,
removed hood – and his own bag with the cup lost forever.</p>

<p>Gorvel turned his head slowly to the witness
of his humiliation, his eye, blazing with fury, flashed in the
slit. Thomas felt disgusted. Out of the corner of his eye, he saw
the Black Warrior taking a knife out of his belt. Thomas froze. The
Black would knife him like a sheep, like a chicken, killing a man
is the same to him as adjusting his belt. <emphasis>A civilizer. A
champion of progress…</emphasis></p>

<p>The Black smiled maliciously. He spotted the
fear in the knight’s eyes, his desperate attempts to release hands
or at least to jerk his head away from the knife. The Black brought
the blade to Thomas’s throat, his grin went broader. “Finish!”
Gorvel croaked. “Finish off now!”</p>

<p>Thomas’s lips moved silently, as he made
prayers. His eyes were fixed on the gleaming blade. The sun finally
came out, the tip of the knife blazed with a terrible orange glare,
as though burning hot.</p>

<p>Suddenly the fingers faltered. The knife
blade made a wary swing, like the head of a snake about to jump.
Then the fingers unclenched, dropping the knife. With a dull thud,
it went into the log before Thomas’s face, all but cutting the tip
of his nose. Perplexed, Thomas wrenched his head: the Black Warrior
was falling on his back, his mouth gasping. In his left eye socket,
a feathered arrow end trembled voluptuously.</p>

<p>Gorvel started, with either astonishment or
the strong blow heard clearly to Thomas: a long arrow cut through
the mail, went deep into the left side of the chest. The Black
Warrior collapsed with a thunder that made the moorings shake,
sprawled like a tall tree. Gorvel sank down slowly on his corpse,
sobbing with fury, grasping at the arrow with his stump.</p>

<p>That was when Thomas heard the shouts of
fright. He felt the speed and mortal accuracy of the deathly arrows
cutting through the air. His guards darted about, hit against each
other, tried to escape, but almost each of them got an arrow
emerging in him with a light click. Thomas heard the soft swishing,
barely audible in the thunder of waves, even the muffled strikes of
shafts piercing through the light armor, crushing and splintering
bones.</p>

<p>He waited until the arrows stopped swishing
overhead, crawled away from the mooring edge, moving like a worm.
Dying men writhed around, uttered awful screams, feeling the
torments of hell close.</p>

<p>He saw the wonderer emerging from the
riverside rocks, rushing, like a furious elk, to the moorings.
Thomas shouted a warning. “More of them!”</p>

<p>Running, the wonderer drew out his huge
sword. At the same moment, some dark squatting shadows started to
leap onto the logs from the water. The first three advanced their
curved swords, the rest were climbing on the moorings behind
them.</p>

<p>The wonderer came like an avalanche, with a
broad sway of sword. The Hazars, taken aback, had time neither to
dodge nor to defend: the menacing blade reached some in chest,
other in throat. Cut-away hands fell down on the damp logs, with
sabers still clenched in fists.</p>

<p>The wonderer made two leaps up to Thomas,
swayed his sword. Thomas felt a hit, and his limbs got spread
sideways. Stunned, he got up to his fours, shook his head. His body
had no time to go numb of tight bounds, so he groped around,
feeling Hazar sabers one by one, crawled up to his sword that lay
under the dying Gorvel. With a strong jerk, Thomas tore his masking
helmet off and recoiled with disgust. <emphasis>Who made the poor man that
ugly?</emphasis> “Sir Gorvel, if God is for us, who is against us?”</p>

<p>Gorvel had no more lips: only wrinkled gums
with two last teeth in the right end of his lower jaw. His only eye
blazed with hate. Gorvel tried to say something but only gave a
rattle, dark blood gushed out of his throat. He coughed, splashing
the blood around, tossed his head back, his eye died out.</p>

<p>“May you get lazy devils,” Thomas wished. He
tugged his sword out from beneath the corpse, roared, forcing his
fury, jumped into the battle. “Death to Pagans!”</p>

<p>The wonderer said nothing, his sword whirling
like mad over him and around: he seemed surrounded by a wall of
glittering steel. Someone threw a sword, it bounced back with a
tinkle, all but hit Thomas.</p>

<p>The knight slashed into the fighting. With
beastly fury, he brought his first blow down on the Hazar who
sprung ahead. The foe advanced his shield deftly overhead, grinned
and bent a little, his saber pointed at Thomas’s belly. The sword,
as heavy as an anvil, thundered down and smashed everything
together: the shield, the Hazar, and the saber. For a moment, the
enemy looked a giant turtle, but the sword went on until the blade
touched the moorage logs, then the iron turtle broke in halves and
the log gave a nasty squirt of foul water.</p>

<p>Thomas raised his sword, jumped aside from
the falling body: a broad-breasted Hazar coming down on him,
sprinkling blood out of his nose, ears, eyes, throat, even from
under his shoulder blades, as though hammered by a giant. The
wonderer lowered his sword. For a moment he and Thomas stood face
to face, breathing heavily and baring their teeth, like two wolves
in the flock of killed sheep, then the wonderer blurted hoarsely,
“Follow me! Quick!”</p>

<p>Thomas rushed after his friend. They ran up
the steep bank, like two hot horses, dashed across the steep. On
the go, Oleg pointed with hand at the entrance to the cave, a black
gap in the brightly lit mountain wall. Thomas nodded silently,
saving his breath.</p>

<p>They were in half a hundred steps from the
gaping hole when the ground went trembling. From behind a rock, an
animal, which Thomas at first glance mistook for another rock,
dashed in heavy leaps. He was grey, human-shaped but three times as
tall as a man, the bottom part of his body the broadest, each leg
twice as thick as a human body, a roundish head straight on the
shoulders, with no neck, his chest as large as a barn, his long
arms, each as thick as an old oak, reached to the ground.</p>

<p>The beastly man bellowed, blocking the
entrance. His eyes on the grey face flashed with red fire, his
sharp hairy ears pricked up. The beast opened his monstrous jaws,
showing his teeth, started to walk on the people: his arms spread
wide apart, each finger the size of a billet, with a glittering
sickle of a claw.</p>

<p>Thomas backed. With horror, he felt that the
animal, despite his clumsy looks, would come up with in two or
three lips, crush and make mincemeat. “Our Lady,” he whispered in
terror, “save and have mercy… Sir wonderer, that’s our death!”</p>

<p>“It is,” Oleg said hoarsely. He backed, his
mad goggled eyes were fixed on the animal coming upon. “I didn’t
expect this!”</p>

<p>The beast’s red mouth puffed out the clouds
of smoke, sprinkled with yellow saliva. Where a drop of it fell,
stones broke with a crash, smokes rose. Thomas looked at his scary
sword: it would not do to cut even the monster’s finger. “Our Lady,
is it the end? Help, as I bear the cup with the blood of your
son…”</p>

<p>He bit his tongue as he recalled the cup’s
being in hands of the Secret Seven. The enemies won at the end, got
the cup! <emphasis>Why don’t they leave the two of us be? Only Gorvel
craved for revenge, and to Seven I’m like a fly to a dog…</emphasis></p>

<p>The beast leapt, disallowing them to burst to
the cave, spreading his huge paws, his iron claws made a grind, his
jaws opened wider. His blazing eyes were looking down, straight at
Thomas. The knight’s soul froze with terror, shrank into the
farthest corner and stay there trembling, shielding its eyes with
paws. He felt the burning heat of the beast’s breath. The wonderer
stood pale, with a switch of his sword in both hands.</p>

<p>Suddenly they heard a clatter of horseshoes
approaching. A shining knight on a snow-white stallion darted out
from behind the mountain crest. Both the knight and his horse were
radiant, the light growing brighter with every moment. The knight
bent down to the mane, a lance advanced menacingly in right hand, a
gleaming triangle shield on left elbow, with a sigil strange to
Thomas. The knight had his visor lowered, his destrier galloped,
the shining lance head looked straight at the monster’s side.</p>

<p>The beast uttered a scary roar, turned to the
rider. The monster was as huge, squat, and indestructible like the
pyramid of Egypt. The knight and his horse looked tiny. The sun
dazzled Thomas, he seemed to catch a glimpse of a young face under
the lowered visor. The shine moved swiftly together with the rider,
while the beast was surrounded by darkness. Above him, black crows
darted in circles, cawing ominously, flapping their wings, and
impossibly big bats and flying hounds moved silently in the
air.</p>

<p>The beast leaned forward, catching the
galloping rider with giant paws. Thomas bit his lip and the
wonderer swore loudly: the mysterious knight was dashing as
straight as an arrow flies… The beast gave a triumphant roar, but
the rider got through a moment before the huge palms came together
with stone crash, his lance went with a terrible force into the
left side of the chest.</p>

<p>For a moment it seemed to Thomas that the
lance would shatter, as it used to happen in jousting: the beast’s
chest was a real stone, but the lance broke through the bones, went
in almost up to the handle. A fountain of dark, almost black blood
spurted out of the wound, hissed, steaming with poison. The beast
jerked his head up, uttered such a terrible roar that Thomas
dropped to his knees and pressed his palms on his ears.</p>

<p>The mysterious knight should have left his
lance to escape the giant paws cutting through the air blindly. The
stallion bent his hind legs, backed, wheezed in fear. The knight,
however, tugged his lance out with force, while his horse backed,
stunned with the roar, so the lance went out with a squelch,
blooded and smoking as though just from the hell’s fire.</p>

<p>Being skillful with reins and spurs, the
knight made his stallion back until they were three score steps
away from the reeling beast whose bellowing made both the ground
and the sky tremble. His blood gushed out of the wound in a spurt
as thick as a log. The stones below went black and smoking, some
dark red flames flared up. Finally, the monster stiffened,
half-hidden by the smoke, and collapsed with a crash, his
outstretched paws all but reached the stranger’s horse.</p>

<p>The cloud swallowed the dying beastly god.
They only heard a fading roar, groans, grinding of claws on the
stone. When a blow of wind swept the smoky cloud away, tearing it
to scraps, there were only black burnt stones on the ground.</p>

<p>The rider raised his lance to salute Thomas.
His visor was lowered still but a pure unearthly light was coming
through the thick grating: so pure that it made Thomas’s heart beat
fast, with hysterical sobs. He barely retained from sinking down to
his knees reverently. Instead, he jerked up his sword and, holding
it vertical, put the handle to his forehead, then to his shoulders
– left first, right second – and finally to his belly.</p>

<p>The mysterious rider turned his horse and
galloped away. Oleg looked with great astonishment, still feeling
stunned with the stranger’s sudden arrival and the miraculous
rescue from the beastly god. The knight and his mount, as Oleg saw
clearly, vanished in the thin air in their fourth jump.</p>

<p>Thomas sheathed his sword, crossed himself
piously – with his fingertips that time. “I was honored!.. Like Sir
Aragorn.”</p>

<p>Oleg stared in confusion at the spot where
the Virgin had vanished. <emphasis>Who was babysitting for her? Nicolas is
the one to nurse a baby until it stops squeaking. And other saints
are not too good at nursing either, it’s written on their mugs.</emphasis>
“No more faithful knights than one or two,” he said
understandingly. “If she comes running to the aid of each!”</p>

<p>“Stupid you,” Thomas told him with
superiority. “When the sovereign accepts the oaths of his vassals,
he in turn swears to protect them!”</p>

<p>“Oh, foxy you… Why your sword in? Let’s run,
or we’ll be late!”</p>

<p>Their feet rang on the melted ground crusted
with hot stone. In one place at the edge of dark spot there was a
crunch, Thomas all but fell sprawled: his foot went in, breaking
the crust through like thin ice. Oleg ran into the gap with his
sword ready, Thomas rushed after with bare steel: a hope to return
the cup flashed in his soul. <emphasis>If the Secret One has not carried
it to her treasury yet. That must be somewhere in Hell.</emphasis></p>

<p>The cleft narrowed, vaulted overhead. The
floor beneath their feet was even, scattered with stones sized from
a fist to a ram that had rolled down from the walls. It darkened
fast. When Thomas glanced back, there was a light slit with the sun
shining in, while the way above reeked of decay, mold, rotten
leaves, and also a sweetish smell of decomposing flesh.</p>

<p>Oleg glanced back and yelled, “Quick! Move
your ass!”</p>

<p>Offended, Thomas rushed ahead like an elk,
hitting stones off the walls with his iron shoulders, jumping over
rocks, but still lagging back the wonderer who dashed like an arrow
shot of a compound bow by a strong hand. Thomas got hot and
puffing, gasping for air, choking with heat, when the passage made
a turn. Bones, animal and human alike, crunched beneath his
feet.</p>

<p>They burst into a big cave with a high vault
where long icicles hung down, dismal and deathly pale, and a dark
lake in the middle. The place smelled of mustiness, there were long
grey manes of moss creeping down the walls, a glisten of mold, a
smooth slime covering the walls.</p>

<p>Thomas heard the wonderer’s breath rattling
and whistling, as though some bellows blown in, but the wonderer
caught his sympathetic look and replied in a sullen grunt. “Listen
to yourself!.. I can hear dogs barking in you.”</p>

<p>Thomas breathed fast and deep, trying to
shake a faint feeling off. His hands were trembling, wet hilt
slipping out of numb fingers. Oleg wheeled round to the dark
passage from where they came: some voices were heard from there, a
footfall, a clang of steel, the nasty smell grew stronger. Thomas
saw his friend shaking his fists in fury, then Oleg calmed down
suddenly and alerted.</p>

<p>The ground gave a shake, they heard a dull
distant stroke. There was a strong blow of stink, the crash
subsided, they heard stones that came rolling from above lying
down. “A collapse?” Thomas asked, feeling creepy.</p>

<p>“Buried,” Oleg replied with strange
satisfaction. His breast rose fast, a look of his bloodshot eyes
sharp and furious. “No one will get out!”</p>

<p>“And we?” Thomas whispered.</p>

<p>“Off chance, Sir Thomas… He whom God helps
nobody can harm.” He spat a grey clot of dust down on the stone
floor, rubbed with boot sole. His face was twisted. Suddenly Thomas
grasped in fright that was the first time he saw the wonderer, so
humble and apparently drowsy, in rage.</p>

<p>“I’m tired of fighting,” Thomas said. “I want
home…”</p>

<p>“Are you? And I’ve just began to rage! A
Russian man harnesses the horse slowly.” He shot a sudden glance
above, seized Thomas by arm and yanked away. Thomas fell down, felt
dragged. There was a crash, stone splinters flew at his eyes. A
huge stone icicle, the size of a warhorse, that had fell from the
ceiling lay where he stood a moment before.</p>

<p>Oleg helped him up his feet quickly, dragged
between the curving wall and the brim of the lake. Strange round
heads looked out of the dark water. Their droopy whitish hair was
dismal, they followed the running man with round frog eyes,
unblinking. Once Thomas saw wet hands reaching for him: fingers
webbed, like goose toes, but topped with sinister curves of long
claws. He screamed and overran Oleg.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<p>Chapter 40</p>

<p>Thomas ducked into the nearest cleft, without
waiting for the wonderer. Strange creatures were coming out of the
lake, water streaming off them, claws and fangs glittering in the
semi-dark. The two men ran several steps bending, their heads
touching the vault. Then the tunnel widened, they ran faster.
Thomas was ahead, but suddenly he screamed and stopped so abruptly
that Oleg came running into his iron back, hurt himself and hissed
angrily, like a giant snake.</p>

<p>They were on the threshold of a colossal
cave: its vault invisible high in the dark, walls separated by
hundreds of steps. Something about that place reminded Thomas of
Agathyrsian underground. In the middle, there was a colossal
bloody-red stone slab, with writing on both sides in ancient lines
and cuts, which, as Thomas knew from old legends, had been brought
to Britain by settlers from Cimmeria or Scythia<sup>27</sup>.
The slab had about seventy feet in length but Thomas grasped at
first glance that was no rock but a giant tomb. <emphasis>A grave of
unknown giant!</emphasis> The stone lid was made of red granite, the thick
edges seemed to be pressed down by own weight to merge with the
lower part, like two wax halves merge on a hot day.</p>

<p>Oleg pushed his back angrily with both hands.
“Quick, you fool! Quick!”</p>

<p>Thomas rounded the stone tomb clumsily, felt
a strange blow of warm air from it.</p>

<p>Oleg clung to the stone for a moment.
“Svyatogor! Svyatogor!”</p>

<p>Thomas glanced back from the other end of the
cave. He rather imagined than heard a heavy sigh, as though uttered
by a mountain. The cave seemed small at once. “Muromets?..
You?..”</p>

<p>“Oleg the Wise! Any old arms here,
Svyatogor?”</p>

<p>Thomas strained his ears. That time he heard
it distinctly: a mighty low voice that filled the cave and seemed
to move its close walls apart. “Oleg the Wise?.. I was preparing to
become a hermit like you… Only holy books here…”</p>

<p>Thomas heard nothing more but a loud clatter
of the wonderer’s boots. The tunnel made an abrupt turn, they ran
across a small cave. Their feet raised colored dust. There were
rows of narrow-necked vessels in the corners, a huge metal mirror
on the wall, two giant chests beneath it, heaps of woman’s dresses
everywhere.</p>

<p>Thomas cast a searching look around, but Oleg
hit him between the iron shoulder blades. “The room of Sinegorka!
Svyatogor’s wife… No cup here!”</p>

<p>They ran out, gasping for air. Thomas was the
first to hear heavy footfall, so he slowed down his pace, twisted
his head round, and stopped. The wall-shaking steps were coming
from ahead, approaching.</p>

<p>Thomas drew his sword, almost with relief,
leaned against the wall. His breast was heaving, his eyes poured
over with sweat, his breath burst out as though from a rusty
trumpet. Oleg stopped, with his breath rattling, his face exhausted
and aged.</p>

<p>Heavy footsteps stopped. On the threshold of
the cave, blocking the way out, there stood a colossal – twice as
tall as a man – heavy beast: a scary ancient lizard covered with
thick horny shield plates so tight that there were no slits at all.
His sharp wide-set eyes looked coldly from a slit in his thick
skull. For no moment they would let the wonderer out of sight. The
beast stood on his hind legs, resting also on his thick tail
studded with spikes and horny excruciations on bony plates. The
dragon’s chest had a metal glitter, and his forepaws, short and
apparently weak, were twice as thick as Thomas’s arms.</p>

<p>“Goodness!..” Thomas babbled. He took a
firmer grip of his sword, clenched his jaws, ready to strike and
crush until he falls dead in the glorious battle.</p>

<p>The wonderer sounded unusually strained.
“Thomas, wait… Is it you, Sardan? Don’t conceal, I can see you in
any guise!”</p>

<p>The dragon made a heavy step forward, his
jaws flung open suddenly. His roar stunned Thomas: the knight
squatted, as though hammered on his helmet, barely kept his sword.
His head was ringing, he felt helpless, his own voice came out as
thin as a gnat’s chirp. The wonderer yelled back, the dragon roared
again, then, through pounding in Thomas’s ears, came a harsh,
enraged voice. “Adept of Ancient Arts?.. Magic of transformation
into a beast?”</p>

<p>The wonderer’s counters began to tremble – so
it seemed to startled Thomas – then got blurred. The pilgrim’s pure
appearance showed out some beastliness, more dreadful than a
dragon’s, his face started to lengthen into a scary snout, but the
next moment Thomas heard his voice, hoarse with hatred. “No, the
adept of subhuman… I’m the Wise, I look in the future!.. You took
what man had been, I take what he will be!”</p>

<p>There were bright bloody-red flashes about
the cave, then it was flooded by a rich color of fresh blood. The
wonderer’s rags flared up, fell down in burning pieces. He stepped
over the fire and smoke, bare and red-hot, his strained muscle
seemed metal to Thomas. There were no more than five steps between
the foes, both stared at each other in a duel of eyes: a huge beast
and a man unarmed but strangely dangerous.</p>

<p>With a roar, the dragon rushed on the man.
Thomas shrunk back to the wall, raised his sword overhead. The
dragon’s terrible claws, shiny like diamonds, went into the
wonderer’s bare back. Red blood spurted out. Thomas bustled along
the wall, escaping the rolling rock of bones and claws by miracle.
Several times he raised the sword but dared not to strike: the
beast and the wonderer had grappled each other so tightly that the
one atop changed at every moment.</p>

<p>The beast roared with triumph malice, his
mouth breathed fire, his teeth looked like white-hot knives. He had
no chance to use his teeth to end the battle: the wonderer’s
fingers were breaking his jaw off, the dragon bellowed fervently,
tried to crush the man in his forepaws. Once the beast got used to
pressure coming from one side, Oleg yanked the jaw suddenly into
another. There was a crack, a crunch of joints, the dragon choked
with own roar. His jaw dropped, as though suspended on a cloth, a
trickle of blood ran down his narrow snake tongue, black and
forked. With a hoarse roar, the dragon thrust the man overhead, all
but reached the vault, going to smash him on the stone floor.</p>

<p>Thomas slashed the beast’s leg, holding sword
with both hands. It was like slashing stone: the blade bounced off
with such a force that made his arms numb up to the shoulders,
yellow sparks flew sideways. Then the sword was thrown down, its
point produced some sparks out of the floor too… Suddenly the
dragon uttered a terrible roar of fear and pain: the knight’s sword
reached his foot and cut three clawed toes off. Within the cut,
there was a brief glitter of big bones, then dark blood gushed out
at once over the floor. The chopped toes twitched, scratched with
claws.</p>

<p>The dragon lowered his head, his blazing eyes
searched for Thomas. The wonderer thrust his fingers with force
into the red of them, Thomas heard a distinct crunch, then the
dragon bellowed even louder. Feeling himself fainting, Thomas
slashed with his last strength on another foot, the same vulnerable
spot on it. At once he was yanked up and flung across the cave. He
hit against the floor, rolled with a thunder of steel. For a moment
it was dark before his eyes, he felt blood in his mouth, all of his
bones aching. With great effort, he struggled up his feet, the way
he had risen, even more exhausted, for the seventh storm of the
Tower of David.</p>

<p>In three score steps there was a creepy ball
rolling with roar, crunch, crackle, rattling breath. Thomas hurried
there, oblivious of himself leaning on the sword as though it were
a staff and dragging his right leg.</p>

<p>The roar was getting muffled until it turned
a hiss. The monstrous ball unrolled, the beast’s head fell on the
floor with a heavy bony thud. He lay on his back, his forepaws
gripping his blooded mug, his hind paws twitching convulsively,
scratching the floor. There were two deep wounds in the dragon’s
throat. The wonderer, if that man really was him, sat on the
dragon’s chest. He was blood-stained all over.</p>

<p>Thomas turned away hastily. The beast’s belly
is torn apart, like a rotten cloth, two ribs protruding through the
broad cut. The slime is gurgling in it, the liver, as huge as a
boulder, twitching, craving for life, but the head does not move as
though glued to the floor. Thomas kept his sword ready for a
strike, just in case, came closer and saw the sharp cervical
vertebrae broken and smashed mercilessly, jutting out through the
broken skin. The head, as large as a rock, was only kept by
sinews.</p>

<p>Oleg stood up, ferocious, bathed in the
dragon’s blood, and Thomas freeze all over – the wonderer seemed
more dreadful than the dead beast. “Oleg,” he said in a shaky
voice, “is it what man will be?”</p>

<p>The wonderer’s face, twisted in the beastly
convulsion, smoothed down slowly, like high storm waves when a
barrel of oil is poured over them. His furious eyes were still
blazing like two blooded stars, but his creepy bulging muscle
subsided and smoothed out. He spoke in a scary inhuman voice, “He
may be that…”</p>

<p>He jumped off the huge corpse. His mouth was
dripping with blood, he wiped it off his lips disgustfully with the
back of his hand. His chest made one more mighty raise and fall,
his eyes lost their bloody glitter. He spoke in his usual but dead
tired voice. “People can be different… but they will be what we’ll
make them.”</p>

<p>In a dark side passage Oleg slowed down his
pace. “To the left!.. Two guards there. Sir Thomas, we need no
knightly tricks, such as a challenge for jousting…”</p>

<p>“I see,” Thomas interrupted. “Your company
had made me a Scyth, even a Rus. I must kill them without noise,
yes? As common men?”</p>

<p>“As villains,” Oleg grunted.</p>

<p>Thomas could hardly see Oleg’s figure: it was
almost pitch-dark, with only a torch lit far beyond the turn,
casting a faint gleam on the granite crystals. Beneath the torch,
two guards sat straight on the floor, their backs leaned against
the wall. They held bare swords between their laps and seemed
drowsy.</p>

<p>Thomas tried to step as silently in his armor
as the wonderer did barefoot and naked, but the corridor got filled
with crashing, clanging, ringing sounds – those could be made by
the beast if he’d crushed them and were coming back. The guards
stood up hastily. One asked loudly, apparently briskly, to
demonstrate they had been wide awake, “Your Might? Are the outlaws
captured?”</p>

<p>“Only one,” Thomas replied in a rude voice,
nodded at Oleg. “The other is hiding.”</p>

<p>“We’ll find him!” the guard promised with
servility. “All entrances are sealed. No way out for gnat, nor for
ant. And which has esca–”</p>

<p>He raised the torch higher, it lit the
approaching Thomas. The guard’s eyes opened wide, his mouth opened
for a cry. Oleg hurled the stone he had ready. A dry crunch of
teeth, and the guard leaned against the wall, his throat swallowing
his cry along with his blooded teeth and the stone. The second
raised his sword, but not for attack: he was definitely going to
strike on the iron door, calling out other guards… or something
worse. Thomas, having no time to reach him, threw his two-handed
sword like a spear. The guard sobbed, lurched: the sword pierced
him through just under his throat. He slid down the wall, his back
leaving a red trace, a broad steel point looking out between his
shoulder blades.</p>

<p>While Thomas tugged out his sword and wiped
it clean, Oleg stripped the bigger of two guards off quickly,
pulled his clothes on and became again the same wonderer whom
Thomas seemed to have known for lifetime. Though now the wonderer
walked with his jaws clenched, the knuckles of his fists white, his
eyes narrowed. <emphasis>Like a lynx before a risky jump.</emphasis></p>

<p>“Want your cup back?” Oleg asked
suddenly.</p>

<p>“As much as my soul saved!” Thomas
blurted.</p>

<p>“It’s beyond this door. I mean the cup.”</p>

<p>“My soul too…”</p>

<p>Oleg backed a step, scowled at the door,
dashed ahead, advancing his shoulder. There was a brief flash of
fire around the wonderer as he struck, a burst of bolts and bars,
and the folds flew open, as if it were a door of doghouse kicked by
a giant.</p>

<p>They burst into the room in clouds of dust
and blue smoke. Thomas rushed on two big warriors before they could
gather their wits, but they gripped their sabers at once, having
their heads kept.</p>

<p>Oleg leapt on Isfahan: he had never seen that
One before but knew enough of him to use the first opportunity to
seize him by throat. They collapsed on a floor, the stone cave gave
a shake. It became hot as Arabian desert, with a smell of burnt
stone.</p>

<p>Thomas’s sudden attack pressed his foes to
the wall. Two violent blows slashed the shield of one and stunned
another on his helmet. The first warrior slipped beneath Thomas’s
arm. Fiercely, the knight brought his sword on the stunned man and,
with no second look at the falling body, swung round to another
one, parried a glittering saber, made a wolfish grin and started to
press him into the corner.</p>

<p>Oleg and Isfahan were rolling about the cave,
grappling and strangling each other. Both emitted heat. Thomas’s
armor got hot, he began to gasp for hot air, the sword hilt burnt
his fingers. His enemy also bared his teeth with malice. Covered
with sweat, he looked like an animal at bay. While fighting, he
shot glances at the wonderer and his master rolling in the middle
of the room, as though expecting for help. With his last strength,
Thomas pressed on him with heavy blows, feinted with his hand,
putting it under the glittering saber: the blade rang and bounced
off the steel plate, Thomas’s other hand struck with sword at
once.</p>

<p>The ball of grappling fighters was rattling
and crunching on the floor, pebbles under the rolling bodies burst
with ringing sounds, as though in an oven. Suddenly the cave walls
shook with a hollow rumble, a grey crack ran across the grey floor.
The magicians would get up on their knees, seize each other’s necks
again, pound with fists, wheeze madly, choking with hate. The crack
was moving apart. From the depth, a puff of heat came out, a cloud
of smoke raised, an orange flame darted after it and hid again,
then some red sparks flew out like big flies.</p>

<p>Oleg and the master rolled over the crack.
While sliding back, both got stuck in the widening gap. Thomas
breathed heavily, reeled in the struggle against torrid heat that
made sweat pour over his eyes and dry out at once, leaving the
salty crust on his face. Hastily, he stepped up to the fighters,
stretched his hand for Oleg to seize him and drag away from danger,
but a scorching puff came in his face, his brows and eyelashes
crackled. He shielded his face with a palm, advanced another hand,
groping in the air blindly, stooped over…</p>

<p>His fingers got burnt, he barely kept a
scream. There was a thunder, a hit of dry crash on his ears. He
took his palm off his eyes for a moment, started back.</p>

<p>The cave was crossed, from end to end, by a
blazing crack, wide enough to swallow a rider with his horse.
Clouds of thick black smoke came belching from it, smelling of
burnt flesh, skin, and bones. The cave vault was blazing with glows
of the hellish fire buzzing in the depth. Thomas seemed to hear a
long terrible scream, as if someone kept falling down away through
the endless flames.</p>

<p>Coughing and rattling with dry throat, Thomas
crept to the far wall, pressed his back on it. The smoke was eating
his eyes, the stiffened bodies of dead Hazars lay at hand: the
blood covering them had dried out in the heat, turned a brown
crust, already cracked, like a bark of old trees. On the other side
of the crack, through fire and smoke, Thomas saw a small marble
table dimly. The cup, polished by the bag during the journey, was
gleaming on it. <emphasis>The Holy Grail!</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas made a superhuman attempt to rise, but
his heat-stricken body could not move. He felt dizzy, delirious
visions flashed in his mind. Suddenly he realized he was dying, of
the hellish fire and overdried air, but felt no fear, only grief
that he failed to deliver the cup…</p>

<p>The walls gave a dull crash, he felt a heavy
jerk beneath, then a ringing clatter of pebbles on his helmet and
shoulders. Dust and smoke hid the cup for a moment, then there
seemed to be a blow of coolness. Thomas shook his head to clear his
sight: the edges of crack had come together, into a black broken
line. They were rising in turns, Thomas heard the stone blocks
grinding and crackling.</p>

<p>He pushed himself off the wall, fell to his
fours and crawled across the cave. The floor stopped trembling but
kept burning his fingers, as well as his armor burnt his body. In
the smoky room, the cup shone with a pure unearthly light,
strangely familiar. Thomas sobbed: a flash of the same pure light
came from Oleg, his true friend, when he dashed on the door of that
asylum of dark magician!</p>

<p>As his head hit against the leg of the table,
he clung at the burning hot marble, raised his disobedient body.
Once his face was on a level with the cup, it shone brighter, as
though it recognized him. Thomas took it carefully with trembling
fingers, sobbed with exhaustion. The cup was strangely cool, as if
it had stood in a shady garden, on a bank of a cold stream.
Clutching the cup against his steel breast, Thomas staggered back
into the corner where he’d left his sword near the slain Hazars.
Leaning on it as on a staff, he hobbled out of the room, struggled
to step over the broken door knocked out by the wonderer: it was
melted and burnt over.</p>

<p>He had already passed the door when a thunder
came from behind. The stone floor in the middle of the cave rose
with dry crackle and crash, rocks flew sideways like dry leaves.
The wonderer came out and up like a stone pillar: breathing
heavily, exhausted, staggering with tiredness. Thomas screamed,
almost dropped the cup, rushed to his friend. The wonderer leaned
on his shoulder, drops of man’s sweat hissed on the steel plate,
evaporating at once. The wonderer’s breast was rising fast and
high. “You got the cup? Good, It’s very important.”</p>

<p>“Oleg…” Thomas said happily. “Dear sworn
brother… I could not guess you are a demon as well… All right,
we’ll be in Hell together!”</p>

<p>Oleg took in a deep breath, said hoarsely,
“Let’s hurry up.”</p>

<p>“You know the way out?”</p>

<p>“No ideas at all.”</p>

<p>“But how…”</p>

<p>“There’s one more enemy. The Head of Secret
Seven!”</p>

<p>Thomas felt creepy all over, despite the hot
air. “Isn’t it enough fighting?” he asked in a husky voice.</p>

<p>“We need to know: why all that fuss about an
old copper cup?”</p>

<p>He went out of the cave briskly. There was a
rumble behind, the ceiling collapsed. Through the doorway, Thomas
could see huge falling stones. He hurried after the wonderer, felt
a push of hot air on his back. He glanced over again: the ceiling
was down, walls coming closer.</p>

<p>“We have no need of the cave,” Oleg blurted
impatiently.</p>

<p>“None we have,” Thomas agreed, then asked
cautiously, “And that… magician? Couldn’t he survive as you
did?”</p>

<p>“No,” Oleg replied without looking back.</p>

<p>The ceiling in two steps behind Thomas
subsided, a stream of dirty water gushed out. He mended his pace,
ran after the wonderer on the dry. “You killed him?”</p>

<p>“I failed to do it. Too much killing! I
granted his life to him.”</p>

<p>“How is he?”</p>

<p>“Enclosed in stone. About a verst deep in. Or
deeper… I don’t remember.”</p>

<p>Thomas hurried, his dumbfounded eyes fixed on
the hunched back that once was so broad. His sword was sheathed, he
pressed the cup on his breast, as he had no bag anymore. “Won’t he
get free? That would be bad…”</p>

<p>“Even the Secret Seven have no power to free
him! He’s spread inside the stone, merged with it.”</p>

<p>“You are cruel as only a Pagan can be!”
Thomas cried hoarsely. “He’d prefer death.”</p>

<p>“Death,” Oleg replied heavily, without
looking back at him, “is for a long time, very long… And a live man
has hope.” There was a thunder behind them again, sand and pebbles
came down in torrents on their heads and shoulders.</p>

<p>“If he’s imprisoned for life… How long do
magicians live?” Thomas cried on the go.</p>

<p>“Differently,” the wonderer snapped. “Fagim
perished in over hundred thousand, and Trtsik died of old age in
forty… You hold the cup firm! Don’t be distracted. We need to ruin
all this bug-ridden place. No mercy to those who gorge on our
blood. Do as you would be done by!”</p>

<p>They climbed downstairs, then the corridor
turned twice, Thomas clasped the cup with care to his breast.</p>

<p>The corridor ended with a small ordinary
door. Tar torches blazed on both sides of it, scattering sparkles.
No guards, no bars. Thomas shrugged his shoulders with chill.</p>

<p>The wonderer pushed the door, it opened with
no squeak. There was a middle-sized room with ascetic furniture.
<emphasis>A monastic room</emphasis>, Thomas would say if not the presence of
Satan he felt there. The candles burning in the wall niches spread
a pleasant sweetish smell around. In the middle of the cave, there
was a tall table where a broad-shouldered man in black clothes was
sitting with his back to Oleg and Thomas, writing on a parchment
with a white goose quill.</p><empty-line /><empty-line />

<section>
<p>Chapter 41</p>

<p>The man did not turn but continued to write.
“What detained you, the Wise?” he asked slowly.</p>

<p>“Trifles,” Oleg replied. He winced, fingers
of his right hand were feeling a huge swollen bruise on his left
elbow. “Have I kept you waiting too long, Slymak?”</p>

<p>“Never mind,” the man replied. “I had some
things to finish before, anyway.” He put the quill aside, turned
slowly. A deathly cold struck through Thomas, a breath out of
grave. Slymak had white hair and tiny grey beard but radiated the
power Thomas had sensed neither in himself nor in any other man
before. The look of his sunken eyes was piercing. Thomas felt the
evil wise man had known all of him at once, assessed his thoughts
and desires, weighed his honor and knightly pride, looked through
memories of the banks of Don and the beautiful Krizhina. Slymak did
not look a strong man but Thomas had no doubt that a move of his
eyebrow would shatter a stone wall.</p>

<p>“The idea of stealing the cup,” Oleg spoke
slowly, “was yours?”</p>

<p>He spoke with strain, watching every move of
the Head of Secret Seven, while Slymak settled back in his armchair
easily, crossed his legs, smiled in a relaxed, free and easy way.
<emphasis>Like a lord.</emphasis> “The Wise,” he said, savoring that word, “but
have failed to guess… Haven’t you?”</p>

<p>“I have,” Oleg replied honestly.</p>

<p>“Now I can say it,” Slymak said uncaringly.
Thomas caught himself at an anxious thought of himself and the
wonderer as mice in a box together with a big cat. “Surely, the cup
is nothing to us, people of reason. It means little even to
Britain… though it could be some help to her.”</p>

<p>“Who is it important for?”</p>

<p>Slymak smiled condescendingly, fiddled with
his beard. “For the new country, new nation… that could rise
hundreds of years later!”</p>

<p>“Your calculations go that far?” Oleg said in
a dull voice.</p>

<p>“That’s your school, the Wise. You were the
one to lay the foundations of knowing, of exact science. Our
calculations say the cup will be carried across the ocean where a
huge continent lies… In a word, there will be a new nation that may
grow too independent… er… owing to some circumstances of its birth.
That nation could acquire unprecedented power! You know we need no
foes. We need workers.”</p>

<p>“Is the cup bound to get to that new
continent?” Oleg asked.</p>

<p>Slymak nodded at the stiffened Thomas who
stood still, pressing the cup against his chest with both hands.
“His descendants!.. Like father, like son. Adventurers, brigands,
poets, hirelings, dreamers, prophets… All of them shall rush to the
new lands and create the state of new… er… sort. All the states we
know today are just hen coops and farmyards as against that one.
You know we can’t allow it. No nation or kingdom can disobey
us.”</p>

<p>“Have you heard of how Fagim died?” Oleg said
softly. “He was the Head of Secret Seven.”</p>

<p>Slymak’s pale cheeks flashed with red. He
leaned on the back of his armchair, chuckled. “Yes, you succeeded
in uniting Slavs. Though only eastern tribes. But we made this
victory of yours turn out to be a defeat! The son of Rurik, whom
you’d led to Novgorod, tried to accept the Judaism of Khazars. His
wife was baptized in the Orthodox Christian rite. Furious
Svyatoslav, a grandson to Rurik, adhered to the true Russian faith
only because he was indifferent to any gods. And his son,
great-grandson to Rurik… ha ha… left his Russian name of Vladimir
for the Greek one of Basil. With his help, we threw a net of steel
on the savage beast called Rus’!”</p>

<p>Oleg went black, as though burnt by invisible
fire. His teeth made a fierce grind in the cruel silence, he looked
down.</p>

<p>“And Vladimir himself,” Slymak went on with
malicious laughter, “the one baptized your Rus’, was but half a
Rusich, which you fear to recall! Who was… ha ha… his mother?
Malusha, a daughter of Gulcha who’s now one of Secret Seven! And
you know well who was Malusha’s father. You <emphasis>know</emphasis>, don’t turn
away!.. And you know why it was so easy for Malusha to enchant the
furious Svyatoslav, the last Prince of Rus’. You know why his son
Vladimir, who was considered a contemptible offspring of slave
woman, killed his blood brothers… his half-brothers, of pure Rus
blood. And why he became the Great Prince of all Rus’, took the
daughter of Roman emperor for wife, forced the wild Rus’ to
christen!”</p>

<p>Oleg was bending, as though under an
avalanche of falling rocks. He turned ghastly pale, with black pits
of eyes, his breath rattling. He looked aged at once, dead
tired.</p>

<p>“The very name of your nation is all but
extinct,” Slymak snapped fiercely. “In the most remote villages,
where our power has not reached still, there are Ruses but all the
rest are Russian slaves, Russian serfs, Russian servants… Later
they shall be just Russians. You, as a sorcerer, must know well the
difference between noun and adjective!.. Once I met Sardan, just
after he had penetrated to Kievins. ‘What nation are you now?’ I
asked. ‘Russian,’ he answered. I laughed and said, ‘And I am
Greek…’ Ha ha! The top class of humor, you see?”</p>

<p>Every his word bent Oleg down like a heavy
stone dropped on shoulders. Suffering for his friend, Thomas
grasped with fear that the evil mage spoke truth: the wonderer was
the last Rusich. The others in his fatherland were just
Russians.</p>

<p>“Where are your Ratmirs, Vsegnevs, Vedeneys,
Vysheslavs?” Slymak added. He leaned forward in his chair, peering
greedily into the sorcerer’s face contorted with pain. “Princess
Olga took the name of Helen – that must be a particular insult to
you… ha ha!.. Half of man’s names we replaced by Jewish ones, like
Ivan, and the rest by mixture of Greek, Chaldean and other scum. A
better trick than Obres did harnessing your women into their carts!
The present-day Ruses… no, Ruses would not have submitted… Russians
carry us on their backs and sing praise to us!”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head, as if he struggled not
to faint, asked in a lifeless voice, “Why gathered here?”</p>

<p>Slymak’s face twisted, his eyes glittered
with malice. Red spots on his cheeks flashed brighter. “Do you
think we mean to meet you? Try to capture you? Too much honor! I
won’t repeat Fagim’s mistake. I know all about you! I’m stronger.
You know that.”</p>

<p>“Slymak,” Oleg whispered as if he were
clutched between heavy boulders, “you are no kind of beast like
Sardan or Isfahan. They were brutal fanatics. I can guess why you
did not interfere… I know you are genius, Slymak. But why don’t you
see it’s not the way it should be?”</p>

<p>“Wise, I can’t believe my ears! Weren’t that
you to found the Society of Magi in ancient times and put the
Counsel of the strongest Seven at the head of it? To guide all the
nations in the world, to direct, to correct, to lead the way to
good and suppress evil? You were at lead for several thousand
years! Then you supposedly have found another way, so you demanded
to prohibit magic, to destroy it. It is written in records you came
out alone against the whole Counsel…”</p>

<p>Stunned, Thomas shifted his gaze between the
evil magician and own best friend.</p>

<p>“But you won,” Slymak continued. “The new
Counsel took your way. We accepted your knowing, and the magic was
extinguished and banned. The mankind started on the path of
extending knowledge…”</p>

<p>“I did not want fires made to burn witches!”
Oleg interrupted painfully. “The extreme was not only those fires
all over Europe but about the knowing itself too. Of all the
knowery, which means ‘to know,’ ‘to realize,’ ‘to understand,’ you
only took the precise analysis to build all the work of Seven
Secret on it. I know that to make a thing straight you need to bend
it into other side and there had been a wild outburst of magic in
the past… but it’s the way a common man may think! And <emphasis>we</emphasis>
must understand that science is not the only thing people need! You
rubbed magic out of their life – well, though it was done with too
much haste. But you almost deprived them of culture too! That’s
inexcusable.”</p>

<p>The voice of supreme magician grew stern, his
eyes flashed angrily from under overhanging brows. “The culture has
remnants of old beliefs, magic, superstition, and simply ignorance!
That’s not the load to conquer a peak with.”</p>

<p>“Do other Secret Ones hear us talking?” Oleg
asked suddenly.</p>

<p>Slymak’s eyes narrowed, he replied coldly,
“Even grandmasters and plain masters hear us. In all the parts of
the world. But there’s no help for you. Those on your side have
only a silent sympathy, and your opponents came here to stop you.
Culture is a sluggish, hesitating thing, while civilization means
energy, confidence, firm grip!”</p>

<p>“The sunset is far yet,” Oleg said.</p>

<p>“What?” Slymak asked. His lips stretched in a
jeering smile. “Will culture have time to develop the same firm
grip?”</p>

<p>Oleg shivered, as if he got caught in a cold
rain. “Gods forbid culture in power! As well as culture with fists…
Let’s leave it, no agreement we can reach on this point. I see it’s
not about me. Is it a plot against Kiev?”</p>

<p>Slymak laughed with pleasure. “Our men
already have assumed power. Soon they come out openly. Kievins are
already slaves, though they don’t know it. But soon they’ll
know.”</p>

<p>Oleg clenched his teeth: pain was pulsing in
head. He saw the city crackling in crimson flames, men running with
raised axes dripping with blood, arrows and darts flying, mad
horses galloping with empty saddles… “In thirteen years,” he
whispered in depression.</p>

<p>Slymak jumped up in his armchair, took a
firmer grip of armrests. His eyes widened. “Have you calculated?..
No, thus, you rely on intuition, or prognostication as you call it.
Yes, thirteen is our secret number. We resolved to take power in
Kiev and all the Rus’ in thirteen years. To take it openly. To
bring down not only Pagan shrines that survived in some villages
but the stupid Christian ones too. Wherever we win we’ll put our
symbol – the five-pointed star! We’ll put it, Wise… About all the
Kiev, our fangs and claws are hidden, waiting for an order, and
here, in a safe place, the vigilant brain!”</p>

<p>Oleg drooped, his crackled lips moved, he
spoke with entreaty. “Blood again?.. But Kievins shall take axes!
When Ruses are at bay, they always clutch at this last argument!..
Fierce killing again, streams bursting their banks with blood…”</p>

<p>“You see?” Slymak asked with keen interest.
“It’s a pity our calculations, however precise, give no
visualization!”</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head. “Half of Kiev burnt,
many people dead… But don’t be glad, Slymak. That day shall see the
death of all your men. Of every single one.”</p>

<p>Slymak recoiled, as though punched in face.
“When it happens, you say?”</p>

<p>“In 9882 by Russian calendar, 6621 by Jewish,
451 by Saracen, and if we count years since the birth of Christian
god, then it’s 1113… Why so much love for baker’s dozen? After that
butchery, you’ll never dare to act openly, Slymak. Secretly – yes,
but openly – never.”<sup>28</sup></p>

<p>Slymak narrowed his eyes, as though about to
jump. “Won’t <emphasis>you</emphasis> lead to that butchery?”</p>

<p>“You know I’m against killing. And what’s the
use of fangs and claws… without head?”</p>

<p>“Without head?” Slymak hissed very
softly.</p>

<p>A glaring flash of blue fire dazzled Thomas.
Oleg was flung to the wall, enveloped in quivering, strangely
rustling, like butterfly wings, flames. Thomas rushed with raised
sword on the evil wizard but hit against some invisible wall. With
fright, he felt separated from the battle, as though by most
transparent glass.</p>

<p>The wonderer pushed off the wall, a dazzling
white light came on Slymak. The magician stood up (he turned out to
be taller than Oleg), jerked his long lean hands overhead. He was
unaffected by fire, and Oleg the same, flames clung to him like
clothes, but Oleg clenched his teeth, thick blue veins bulged on
his forehead, sinews strained in his neck, as though he shouldered
a mountain ridge.</p>

<p>The blue fire around Oleg flared up. Slymak
stepped to his foe, as though squeezing himself through the mass of
invisible glue. The blue and white flames met. Slymak’s face
stiffened, as well as the wonderer’s, both were breathing
heavily.</p>

<p>Thomas kept clenching his fingers painfully
on the sword hilt. Twice he tried to break through invisible wall,
slashed it, but the heavy two-handed sword rebounded, almost
wrenching his hands. Slymak made one more step. There was a
terrible hiss, a downfall of white sparks. Both enemies, the
magician and the sorcerer, clenched their teeth and fists, trickles
of turbid sweat ran down their scary faces.</p>

<p>Slymak took in a deep breath, alerted. Thomas
felt in fear that was a decisive moment in the fight. The blue fire
blazed up, started to absorb the pure white light. Oleg bared his
teeth in agony, his head tossed back, as he slipped down the wall
helplessly.</p>

<p>Thomas, beside himself with fury, bellowed a
war cry of Angles, brought the big two-handed sword down with all
his might. The gleaming blade, which could break the rider in
halves down to his saddle, met an obstacle, all but stopped, then
broke through the invisible wall and the sword point reached the
enemy magician between shoulder blades!</p>

<p>With a crash, the blue flames vanished at
once. It went dark, as the white fire around Oleg was all but a
smolder. Slymak turned slowly to Thomas, the sword fell out of the
terrible wound, clanged down on the floor. Blood gushed out of the
broad cut. Slymak pulled a face of pain mixed with
astonishment.</p>

<p>Oleg struggled up his feet, leaning on the
wall. His chest heaved fast, his breath wheezed. The wonderer’s
eyes were clouded with pain. Slymak lurched in the middle of the
room, fell to his knees. His dry lips uttered a faint moan, “How
could you?..”</p>

<p>“With no remorse,” Thomas snapped
fiercely.</p>

<p>“Noble knight… on back…”</p>

<p>“I don’t mind what a boar thinks of me!” He
supported staggering Oleg. “Sir wonderer, are you safe?”</p>

<p>Blood trickled out of Oleg’s lips, set at
once. He glanced askew at the dying magician who was still
balancing on his knees in the puddle of own blood, said with
reproach, “You could do it earlier… You are my only chance!”</p>

<p>Slymak was going as yellow as a dead man, the
puddle of blood spreading.</p>

<p>“May I,” Oleg asked, “tell your will to
someone? Your last words?”</p>

<p>The lips of supreme magician stirred, he
whispered faintly. “Come back… To the head of the Counsel of Secret
Magi… your own brainchild…”</p>

<p>Thomas sprang aside from Oleg in fear, felt
the sword hilt.</p>

<p>Oleg shook his head. “Until there is power
over power… I am the eternal opposition.”</p>

<p>Slymak collapsed face first, splashing the
blood over the floor.</p>

<p>Thomas felt sick of the awful wound: cleaved
bones, gurgling blood, the body still trying to live… “It is fatal
even to a magician,” Oleg told him softly. “Let’s get away from
here.”</p>

<p>The opposite wall cracked and slid apart, as
though obeying his gesture – or it did obey. In a small room filled
up with thick books, rolls of maps and drawings, a small woman sat
at the table, her head rested on her hands. She started with
fright, and Thomas recognized at once those raised surprised
eyebrows, innocent eyes, tender features of her face. <emphasis>The woman
who took the Holy Grail!</emphasis> He pressed the cup instinctively to
his chest.</p>

<p>“Sir Thomas,” the wonderer said gloomily,
“let me introduce to you… my most dangerous enemy! Gulchachak or
Gulcha… Not a true name, but that’s how they call her.”</p>

<p>The woman rose slowly. Her wide open eyes
were searching his still face with disbelief. “You… you killed them
all?”</p>

<p>“Defending,” Oleg replied briefly.</p>

<p>She cast a momentary glance at Thomas. He
braced himself up, dusted his elbows off, stood upright proudly.
“Killed everyone?” she asked Oleg, her disbelieving eyes still
fixed on his gaunt face.</p>

<p>“Defending,” Oleg said again.</p>

<p>She clutched her small fists against her
bosom, screamed in a thin voice. “But how you… He <emphasis>was</emphasis>
stronger! We calculated hundreds of times! No mistake could
occur!”</p>

<p>Oleg made a slow move of shoulders. “Who says
it did? But I had a tiny chance. And I used it.” He put his arm
round her shoulders, led her to the entrance that opened suddenly:
a glare of distant sunlight at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>Thomas felt magicians, Holy Virgin, beastly
god, falling walls, and the beautiful woman who turned out to be
the most dangerous person in the world – all mixing up in his mind.
He trailed along behind them irresolutely, pressing the cup on his
breast, his sword hilt catching at the low ceiling.</p>

<p>The sunlight struck his eyes with pain.
Thomas screwed up, breathing in the cool air greedily. The cold
waters of great river were flowing by near at hand. Behind him,
there were towers of cliffs gaping with black holes: from small
bumblebee or swallow to giant ones. <emphasis>In one of those caves, our
serpent now lies drowsy, counting sacks of juicy meat in his
sleep.</emphasis></p>

<p>The woman turned round slowly to the
wonderer, her face was meek. Oleg looked in her eyes. She lifted
her arms, which were bare and tender, but he caught them, brought
away from his neck, examined her palms closely. With an
imperceptible move, he tore a nail off. It fell down on the ground:
bloody, glittering with razor-sharp edge. The strange woman did not
even wince, looking in the wonderer’s green eyes. All of her nails,
as Thomas spotted with terror, were in place. <emphasis>It appears weapons
are not limited to swords only. A false nail can hide enough poison
to send a legion of heroes to Heaven! Or either to Hell.</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg put her palms on his neck slowly. Their
eyes kept grappling. “Any other tricks?” he asked softly.</p>

<p>“None,” she breathed. “You won again, damn
you…”</p>

<p>“Why so angry?”</p>

<p>“You know, rascal, I wish no one’s death as
much as yours. Let it be terrible. It shall make me free from this
stupid love that follows me through ages!”</p>

<p>Oleg’s eyes showed deep sympathy. He clasped
her to himself, patted the back of his head with his huge palm
gently, as if she were an offended child. “Will they try to stop me
again?”</p>

<p>“You crushed them all,” she replied quietly.
“The rest of the Counsel do not interfere.”</p>

<p>“No more tricks?” he asked.</p>

<p>“No, you bloody winner…”</p>

<p>As he kept patting her, the fingertips of his
left hand ran along her elegant girdle. Their eyes met for a
moment. The sorcerer smirked wider. He took out a hairpin, as thin
as a needle, his fingers cracked it. The broken halves tinkled
against the floor, turned into a poisonous smoke that melted
away</p>

<p>A golden comb flashed in Oleg’s right hand.
Her gleaming hair, as black as raven wings, came down on her
straight back in a released fall of black gold. Oleg dropped the
comb uncaringly. Thomas gasped. The comb turned into a lizard,
orange as melted gold, with a reared comb from the back of its head
to the tip of its tail. Its red eyes blazed with malice like coals.
Baring its teeth, the lizard darted to the sorcerer’s boot, but he
stepped on it quickly with another foot. There was a faint
<emphasis>pop</emphasis>, as though a fish bladder were burst. Small spiders
scattered out from under his double sole, dashed to hide beneath
the stones.</p>

<p>Oleg laughed, took precious earrings out of
the woman’s pink ears made for kisses, tossed them down on the
ground before Thomas, then a brooch, bracelets, hairpins, rings. At
last Oleg took a necklace off her neck tenderly. The knight,
bathing in vile sweat of terror, jumped like a hare, his iron soles
knocked the hellish creatures into the rocky ground, trampled down,
squashed, destroyed.</p>

<p>When he also smashed the necklace, which
turned out to be a tiny basilisk spitting out fire and poisonous
arrows, the woman asked innocently, “Sir knight, did this hypocrite
tell you that your beautiful Constantinople shall fall under the
blows of his sons?.. It shall be ruined forever, along with all the
Eastern Roman Empire.”</p>

<p>Oleg was convulsed. “Do you mean to hurt
him?.. Alas, she speaks truth, Sir Thomas. She bore a hero who will
give rise to a new nation… I recall giving him the name of
Seljuk.”</p>

<p>The woman laughed triumphantly, as she made
herself comfortable in the ring of strong arms, settled on his
broad chest.</p>

<p>Oleg, with his eyes grievous, nodded at the
setting sun. “Sir Thomas, we set off in the morning! Come what may,
here goes! I’ll see you to Britain. I just want a look at the
glorious ancestors of the future nation that will have the blood of
Ruses, the battle fever of berserks, the soft sensitivity and
reason of Germans, the cheerfulness of Franks, the courage of
Irish… I want to see the people who will have the brightest light
of the Holy Grail!”</p>

<p>Still embracing the small woman, he led her
to the dark cave entrance. At some moment the woman seemed to make
a move away but the strong arm kept holding her narrow shoulders
and she went limp, clung to him like a supple vine to a mighty
oak.</p>

<p>Thomas twisted, guessing how he could express
his apprehension delicately. <emphasis>That’s no woman but a full
armory.</emphasis> Oleg and Gulcha were already at the cave threshold when
Thomas yelled at the top of his voice, as if he were storming the
Tower of David again. “Sir wonderer! Oleg! If last time… Seljuk,
what now? Think about the future! Or your victory will become a
defeat…”</p>

<p>Oleg looked back. The knight was clasping the
Holy Grail with both hands at his iron chest. He had the eyes of a
scared deer. The petite woman stopped. For a while the wonderer
stood thoughtful: maybe he was thinking about the future. The woman
felt his hesitation, cuddled up to him with her whole body.
“Future?” Oleg asked vacantly. “Off chance it will come right.”</p>

<p>The last thing Thomas could see – while the
wonderer could not – was that her hand, the one remained free,
darted to the luxurious mane of her hair, tore out a pitch-dark
single hair, and threw aside. Then the couple vanished in the black
gape of the cave.</p>

<p>Thomas stopped breathing. The single hair
transformed imperceptibly into a snake, as black as sin. It
stirred, went crawling to the cave entrance. Thomas jumped after
it. A champ under his boots, a splatter of dark stinky blood.
Thomas trampled down for a while to make it sure, spreading the
black flesh, bones, and even skin on the stones, then wiped his
soles clean with disgust. His heart pounded as if he were a hare
caught by a wolf.</p>

<p>He sat down near the entrance, set the bare
sword up menacingly at his feet. <emphasis>The wonderer won’t beat off a
gnat now. I must guard.</emphasis> His thoughts floundered fussily around
the tribe that would ruin Constantinople in centuries to come. Then
a burning question flashed: what would the people who come of him,
highborn Angle Thomas Malton of Gisland, be like? Where, in which
unknown land would they create their unprecedented state? Would his
descendants bear some resemblance to him, a modest knight
errant?</p>

<p><emphasis>Well, I’m not likely to find it out until
morning comes. The creation of new tribes and nations must be
time-consuming.</emphasis></p>

a Russian word for pilgrim and wanderer. Since late Middle Ages, it
was mostly used to mean a vagrant beggar singer of religious songs,
especially the one physically impaired (Russian word <emphasis>kaleka</emphasis>
[kale’ka], meaning a cripple, derived from it). Also, <emphasis>kalika</emphasis>
is a character of Russian mythology. In some legends, they have
great physical strength and perform heroic deeds and wonders. In
non-fictional contexts, <emphasis>kalika</emphasis> is commonly translated into
English as simply <emphasis>pilgrim</emphasis>, but that does not encompass the
full scope of meanings conveyed in this fiction book and explained
above, so the word <emphasis>wonderer</emphasis> was adopted instead to convey
the original message as close as possible. (The references here and

<empty-line /><p>Bonus: The Secret of Stonehenge, Sample
Chapter</p>

<p>If you enjoyed <emphasis>The Grail of Sir Thomas</emphasis>, look
out for <emphasis>The Secret of Stonehenge</emphasis>,</p>

<p>the next book in the series, also by Yury Nikitin.
Soon at <emphasis>Smashwords</emphasis>!</p>

<p>With the first peal, all the four gates of
Kiev began to creak. Bearded guards, sleepy and angry, dug the
heels of their metal-tipped boots into the ground with strain and
groaned, applying themselves to strong wooden folds. The Great City
was opening to the world.</p>

<p>The powerful sound of bells, as thick as
frozen oatmeal kissel, flowed unhurriedly along the paved streets
of the city, squeezed into the closed shutters, woke people up.</p>

<p>From the city center to the western gate,
with a ringing clatter of hooves on the paving, two riders came on
tall warhorses. They looked like two mounted towers. The first one
was clad in steel armor from top to toe, in the way of noble
Franks. The second one could be taken for his squire or servant if
he was dressed better. No knight would tolerate a servant in a
wolfskin jack, with a simple bow on his back and a rough club,
looking out of his saddle bag, instead of a proper weapon!</p>

<p>The guards greeted the knight, their voices
hoarse after a sleepless night they spent drinking with him at a
local inn. The foreign guest had been paying, they’d called wantons
and had fun with them, roared songs, played for money, arms and
boots (by morning no one could recall what he owed others, so
everyone just took his own things). And what a party without a good
scuffle? They scuffled much and willingly, enjoyed themselves, so
now one has his eye swollen, another his lips thick as flapjacks,
and the third one is unable to get out of the sentry box. But that
was good fun!</p>

<p>Oleg gave a slack nod, though no one bellowed
greetings to him. He was avoided and a bit afraid of. A silent one,
unhurried and reserved. Never carousing, never drinking, he still
looked able to stand for himself. His exorbitant strength could
only be missed by a child or a blind man, and the guards of the
gate were neither.</p>

<p>Thomas held his horse, alerted. The way
through the gate is blocked by three stocky, beastly-looking common
men. All watch him closely, with searching eyes. They look no
warriors, but their moves show big strength, they resemble mighty
bulls who grew in the open. One said something and went straight on
Thomas.</p>

<p>“Don’t strike at once!” the wonderer
whispered. “First we’ll find out what they want.”</p>

<p>The man stopped in front of Thomas, and the
knight felt uneasy. The common man has broad shoulders and looks as
hard as a rock, his arms strong enough to crush the knight’s armor
like the bark of a rotten stump. His sharp eyes under the
overhanging superciliary arches, heavy like mountain ridges, look
in some aiming, demanding way.</p>

<p>Two other men came slowly to flank Thomas.
They smelled strongly of beer and home brew. All the three looked
like woodcutters or stonemasons: the kind who break both tree
trunks and blocks of stone with bare hands.</p>

<p>Thomas cast anxious glances around. The
wonderer kept his gloomy looks: a mysterious glitter in his green
eyes, the iron hoop keeping his red hair on the forehead. <emphasis>He
also looks like a wild woodcutter or stonemason, but he’s beside
me. Not blocking my way</emphasis>.</p>

<p>The common man asked in a deep strong voice
that sounded like a roar of an old bear woken up, “Are you… from
overseas?”</p>

<p>“You guessed right,” Thomas answered in a
constrained voice.</p>

<p>“If from overseas,” the common man roared,
keeping his eyes in Thomas, “you’ve seen more than those who stay
at home…”</p>

<p>“Who would argue?” Thomas said in a guarded
way. “As one wise traveler put it, he who made a walk around his
house is wiser than he who never stepped outside.”</p>

<p>The common man made a nervous swallow, his
stentorian voice broke, a begging note appeared in it, “Yes, that’s
just what I’m talking about. Please tell us, dear guest, give your
advice… How to make Rus’ better?”</p>

<p>Thomas wanted to spit down to the other man’s
feet, his own legs still trembling so that they made his horse
sway, his heart pounding like a hare’s, but there were such grief
and anguish in the common man’s voice that Thomas only grunted,
“Sir wonderer, let’s get out of this mad land. Don’t they see
<emphasis>they</emphasis> are living here, not I? I’d give them a pretty good
advice!”</p>

<p>“Rude you,” Oleg complained. “Though a
noble!”</p>

<p>They left the gate behind, their horses
walked briskly on the morning dew. The sky was clean as a shelled
egg and blue as baby’s eyes, the air fresh as it usually is in the
mornings. The day is going to be warm, though the trees along the
road have already put on their autumn gold and purple.</p>

<p>The knight, Sir Thomas Malton of Gisland,
listened to the church bells piously, crossed himself slowly, with
diligence. Oleg frowned, green eyes went dark. <emphasis>A strange faith,
made for the slaves of Rome, is growing stronger and stronger in my
free nation. Though with fire and blood, hundreds of villages
burnt, sorcerers being killed and crucified, along with those who
refused to name themselves slaves of a foreign lord, even the one
of Heaven.</emphasis></p>

<p><emphasis>Rus’ seems to have had no slaves before, no
habit for slavery, but, just imagine, only few ones dare to protest
openly now. The bravest men stay put in the villages where the Old
Faith remains, and sorcerers only make their heathen temples in the
thick of woods. Looks like our souls have much of timidity if a man
makes no attempt to knife the one who insults him to his face: You
are a slave of the Heavenly Lord…</emphasis></p>

<p>Oleg’s horse, after having a good sleep and
food in Kiev, was eager to break into gallop. The rider had to hold
him, looking back at Thomas. The knightly stallion is no fit for
gallop: too heavy, and his rider is like a tower of steel. <emphasis>He’d
only gallop fifty sazhens, then a full stop: just stand and slash.
That’s enough to cleave any lines like an axe. And the breach is
penetrated by foots: those always follow a knight in crowds, as if
chasing a furious bear.</emphasis></p>

<p>The strong fresh wind hit in their faces. The
sorcerer’s red hair went flickering, as though a blazing torch he
carried in gallop. Behind Thomas, a white cloak, the color of
swan’s wing, was blown up and stretched quivering. The huge red
cross on the white heralded proudly that the knight was not just a
knight but the one of the Christ’s host that had freed the Holy
Sepulcher valiantly from the impious Saracens.</p>

<p>“On the way again,” Thomas said in a fine
manly voice. “What is a man born for if not for traveling?”</p>

<p>Oleg looked askew at the knight’s proud face.
In his long life, he’d heard this question many times before.
<emphasis>And many answers to it. All convincing, but all different.</emphasis>
“Haven’t you swapped the cup for drink?”</p>

<p>Thomas felt his bag hastily. The cup’s
roundish side escaped his fingers for a while, his heart missed a
beat. “Sir wonderer,” he said with displeasure, “I not only haven’t
swapped it for drink but haven’t lost at dice either! Though I’ve
seen noble knights… yes, the ones of the highest birth, lose at
dice not just money, horse and weapons but their wives and castles!
They even lost more than castles: their own <emphasis>names</emphasis>! That’s
the power of Satan, his skill to entrap weak souls…”</p>

<p>“But you played,” Oleg teased. “And all the
games, according to the doctrine of yours, were invented by Satan.
They say it was why your god threw him down: Satan used to win
every game…”</p>

<p>Thomas said with dignity, “Sir wonderer, I
don’t think Sir God would have won no game if he really sat down to
play with the vile devil. But I think He’d not even sit down near
him in the latrine. Sir Satan might have been cheating. Though no,
that’s too… As it was when Sir Satan used to sit on Our Lord’s
right and was not yet the sort he became on earth.”</p>

<p>He crossed himself piously. Oleg laughed. “Oh
yes. He’s lived on earth among people for a while, and he who lies
down with dogs, gets up with fleas.”</p>

<p>Thomas looked puzzled. “Do you want to say
Satan became that vile after he mixed with people? Though… why not?
Man is no angel but he’s craving for light, and devil in his spite
was getting lower and lower until he became worse than man. Then he
also began to provoke man into becoming worse.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. And games remained his domain.”</p>

<p>“So I clashed him! As befits a valiant
knight: in my opponent’s field, and I also left the choice of
weapons to him. I played that impious game, won, swapped my prize
for drink, as it’s dishonorable to buy any good thing for such
money, played again and won again! So I treated those men to
drinks… That was how I put the devil to shame.”</p>

<p>Oleg twisted his head with delight. “Great!
This doctrine… or faith will go far if it allows such an
interpretation of knightly revels that outstrip even sailors on
their loose. Have you bought horse for the money you won?”</p>

<p>“A horse is allowed,” the knight replied
severely.</p>

<p>“Why?”</p>

<p>“From the height of his saddle, I’m
strengthening the true faith. Such a horse can be no instrument of
devil. Just look how handsome he is!.. Sir wonderer, are you sure
we’ll have to ride through forest?”</p>

<p>“All Europe is covered with dark forest. And
your Britain too. There are no Saracen deserts you’ve got used to.
Wherever you ride here, you’ll have to ride in wild woods. But it’s
autumn now, the roads already trodden. In spring there’s no way to
walk, nor to ride…”</p>

<p>“Trodden by whom?”</p>

<p>“First by tramps like us: all sorts of
beggars, knight-errants, outcasts and madmen, then by plain
tradespeople.”</p>

<p>Thomas crossed himself. “Let it be forest
then. I simply don’t like those shaggy men with knives, just like
you, jumping out of shrubs. I give a start then, which is unworthy
of a knight. Unworthy of <emphasis>me</emphasis>, as I have stormed the Tower of
David, fought on the walls of Jerusalem…”</p>

<p>The forest was growing ahead: thick, wild,
impassable. The path ducked under the low branches and vanished at
once, as though in a badger’s barrow. Coolness was felt within
hundred sazhens from the wall of trees. Their mighty trunks were
dark, squat, gloomy. Even their dense crowns looked darker than
usual.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>They rode all the day long, only at noon
allowed their horses a brief rest and had a snack themselves
without making a fire.</p>

<p>“What’s the name of this country?” Thomas
wondered.</p>

<p>Oleg was surprised. “What’s wrong with your
memory? I’ve told you: Rus’.”</p>

<p>“I see that,” Thomas dismissed, “but it was
Rus’ yesterday and even the day before… And whose land are we
crossing today?”</p>

<p>Oleg hemmed. “You’ll get your tongue tired of
asking that. You may ride a horse, crawl a snail, or fly a bird –
anyway it will be Rus’ tomorrow, the day after tomorrow, and the
day after that. And princedoms… All of them belong to Rurikids. One
brother has this one, another has that, the third one has the
third… All taken together, they make Rus’. The Rus’ of
Rurikids.”</p>

<p>Thomas was silent, looked disbelieving. At
last he spoke with doubt, “Marvelous are the works of God… In our
host, there was a unit of valiant Sir Rodoslav, a brave warrior and
merry knight. His men were known for strength, discipline, martial
skill. Everyone marveled that they stood any hardships without a
grumble. Now I recall: they had the same arms and armor I see here.
Does it mean they came from this land?”</p>

<p>“Probably even from this very city. Vyatichi,
for instance, also had a part in those campaigns, but they use
other kinds of equipment.”</p>

<p>Thomas was astonished. “Do Vyatichi come from
here too? I’d have never thought so. I thought they were Vikings.
They stood to the Duke of Tuleb’s left, covering the flank of King
Henry Bluetooth. Brave and fierce warriors as well! Your works
<emphasis>are</emphasis> marvelous indeed, O Lord!”</p>

<p>While saddling the horses, Thomas imagined
the far way they had to make, all those woods, marshes, cities and
villages ahead, sighed and said vexedly, “That’s what I can’t
fathom: you are a wizard of considerable power and you don’t use
it! Except when pushed to the wall. And even then you’d often
rather die than use magic. For me, it looks like having two fast
horses and walking on foot in their dust! You <emphasis>are</emphasis> already
doomed to Hell’s fire! What’s more to fear?”</p>

<p>He expected no reply from the wonderer who
used to avoid such talks, but now the sorcerer was in good spirits.
He laughed. “I could say that’s a vow. It would explain everything
to you, wouldn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Er…”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s really a kind of vow. Though
not to demons: forget that. It’s a vow I made to myself.”</p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“How shall I put it… Just imagine: I also
want to reach the kingdom of heaven. And I’m going the right way.
But each use of magic is throwing me back into the darkness. Magic
is impious… not quite in the way you see it, but you grasp the
general meaning right. Magic is based on implicit faith, and I hate
implicit faith. Magic is not less slavish than Christianity. Every
time I save my bacon with magic, I feel disgraced. You are right:
sometimes it’s better to die than be rescued by those you struggle
against…”</p>

<p>Thomas looked with wide open eyes. “Then you
have more knighthood than any paladin of the Round Table!”</p>

<p>“Thomas, actually I would endure any shame or
disgrace, as I’ve endured many things before, but the use of magic
tramples on more than life. It tramples with dirty hooves on the
very purport of my being! On what I live for.”</p>

<p>It was like the sky opening over Thomas. The
wonderer appeared to bear his own cross, which he, a knight and
Christ’s warrior, could hardly imagine! <emphasis>I only saw and felt the
very edge of it and I was dumbfounded. A dangerous man’s riding
with me. Really dangerous…</emphasis></p>

<p>By evening the breeze dropped, the fragrances
of late herbs and fallen leaves hung in the still air. The huge
crimson ball was subsiding slowly to the edge of the earth.
Coal-black shadows moved on the dark-red ground ahead of the
riders, grew longer, merged with the shadows of rocks, stones, and
trees. The world was wild and unknown: only the two of them and
their horses seemed alive in it.</p>

<p>The sky darkened gradually. At first there
came a barely visible crescent, then a star flashed on, and another
one. Now Thomas and Oleg rode under the deep-blue cup, its lip
rested on the brinks of earth.</p>

<p>By night, in a sparse birch forest, they
bumped into some merchants. Those had put their loaded carts in a
circle, kindled a fire, fetched the brushwood: a thorough
preparation for night, to avoid any surprise…</p>

<p>There was a big caldron gurgling and ringing
its lid on a tripod, and some dark broad slices roasted on the
barked twigs over the hot coals. The smell of roast meat with
exotic spices burnt their nostrils. Thomas gulped saliva down
noisily, and his stallion mended a pace at once, as if he wanted to
eat the meat before his master did. “Greetings to you, noble
sires,” Thomas proclaimed into the space: he obviously did not know
how to address merchants. “Pax vobis. God bless you!”</p>

<p>The merchants watched them with interest. One
stood up. “The same to you, if you mean it. I’ve never seen a
priest in steel before! It’s night, so you may stay with us. We’ll
protect you.”</p>

<p>Thomas went crimson and began to puff up, but
Oleg said meekly, “Thank you, good people. We’ll spent the night
with you.”</p>

<p>“Have you made a long way?”</p>

<p>“Very long.”</p>

<p>The merchants asked no more questions. <emphasis>If
a man can’t or doesn’t want to speak, he should not be forced. One
must not count money in the pockets of others, as many like to do.
Neither one should pump others for what he wants to know. They’ll
tell you if they like.</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas took some lard and a head of cheese
out of his bags: it doesn’t befit to eat only the food of others
and hide what you have. The merchants found a skin of brew, and it
went from hand to hand around the fire. After the meal, they
started a cautious conversation about who the travelers were and
where they were heading for.</p>

<p>Questions were asked in a way that allowed to
evade easily. <emphasis>You never know whom you may meet in woods, so
you’d better hurt no one. It’s the time of trouble: princes lay
hands on everything, foreign missionaries scour around, some trying
to win people over to another faith, others persuading princes into
close unions with either Kazimir or the Polovtsians, or whatever
other dark and far-going aims they have. We merchants can’t always
see our benefit at once, so we’d better offend no one but watch,
listen, and sniff for whatever we can gain from all that
stuff.</emphasis></p>

<p>When the skin got half empty, they began a
sedate and wise talk about how to make Rus’ better, how to live
right, how to bring peace and order at last to the lands that had
always been in disorder, where the order was only promised, to
where long ago they’d even called Germans, in hope they would make
order, but even Germans failed: it was Rus’, no Deutschland of
theirs.</p>

<p>The wonderer squirmed, then asked, “Germans?
Was Rurik a German?”</p>

<p>“A Kraut,” the merchant confirmed, then
thought for a while, scratched his head. “Or a Yid. No way to know
for sure.”</p>

<p>At the height of the revelry, when Thomas was
going to try his luck in game, as play and way is where people show
their true colors, in play and bath everyone is equal, playing is
not stealing – there was a sudden rustle in the tree tops. The air
went trembling, some blue sparks flashed and died out at once.
Branches broke with a crunch, as a bough… not, a whole log was
falling onto the ground.</p>

<p>The log tumbled down and appeared to be
hollow inside. Before anyone could say knife, a lean and tiny old
woman got out of there, like a giant bark beetle. Her face was
wrinkled like a baked apple, she had no teeth but her eyes were
sharp. She dusted off hastily: wooden crumbs were stuck in her
shaggy grey hair, as if she were really gnawing at the wood. “Hail
to everyone,” she said quickly. “Don’t be afraid, I shan’t hurt
you. For some reason, I feel really sated today. I’ll only warm by
the fire if you don’t mind.”</p>

<p>The eldest merchant made a hiccup, forced
out, “We don’t… We don’t mind it at all. Not at all!”</p>

<p>The old woman came closer. She was clad in
rags hanging from her body like the wings of an old bat used to
sleeping among cobwebs. Her pin-sharp eyes measured at once the
motionless figures of Thomas and Oleg. Thomas kept his palm alerted
on the hilt of two-handed knightly sword. There was a nail from
Christ’s cross in it, hammered deeply. <emphasis>The nail sprinkled with
the noblest blood has the power to protect against all the crafty
designs by devil and his servants. Surely, it would only protect
those who’s devoted in their faith. My chaplain promised that. Oh
shit, it’s another sword I have now!</emphasis></p>

<p>“The news of the two of you have spread over
all the earth.”</p>

<p>Oleg, finishing the stale slice of cheese,
objected with his mouth full, “Hardly all of it!”</p>

<p>“All of ours,” the old woman specified.</p>

<p>“Sit down, warm your bones. A knowing
woman?”</p>

<p>“Now they call me witch. People know nothing
about the old knowledge and us who keep it. And they don’t want to
know.”</p>

<p>Oleg clenched his jaws. <emphasis>Again, like many
times before, ignorance comes into the world with triumph. In past,
literacy could be promoted by force, but this new faith of the weak
and poor in spirit proclaims those weak, dirty, and ignorant the
most pleasing to the new god. And literacy is from devil. Beat and
burn the literate!</emphasis></p>

<p>Thomas looked with disgust. He didn’t cross
himself (it did not befit a man to be afraid of a woman, even a
witch) but set aside, lest he touch her by accident with his iron
elbow and get his armor rusty.</p>

<p>The witch lifted her hands. A rustle in the
tree tops again, crunch and fall of boughs. The merchants darted
sideways. A patterned tablecloth spread on the green grass, some
narrow-necked jugs, the likes of which Oleg had only seen in
Hellas, tumbled on the ground. Two colossal winebowls, one of home
brew, another of heady mead, emerged silently, small scoops plopped
down, and in the middle of the tablecloth, moving other things
aside, a roast boar appeared with an apple in mouth.</p>

<p>“Paganism!” Thomas said with disgust.
“Devil’s work!”</p>

<p>“Don’t eat,” Oleg suggested.</p>

<p>“What next,” Thomas was insulted. “Devil
might think I’m afraid of his servants!” He was the first to take
out a dagger (narrow and very sharp, the only fit thing to finish
off a knocked-down knight by thrusting the blade into his visor
slit), stabbed the boar with joy, as though taking a Saracen’s
life. There came a smell of fragrant meat. The boar was young and
juicy. It seemed to be no forest animal but the one fattened in the
warm and care, with milk and fresh bread.</p>

<p>Oleg, laughing up his sleeve, snatched the
slices of roast meat from the fire. The merchants exchanged glances
and reached for scoops. The eldest one pushed his cross deeper into
his collar, scooped the brew at once and took a slice of meat from
Oleg, tasted the brew, listened to himself. A contented smile
appeared on his face.</p>

<p>The merchants ate and drank the witch’s treat
with caution at first, but when the brew got into heads, there were
born Pagans drinking and bellowing songs by the fire. One even
raised the hag to dance, and when some yellow eyes, definitely not
wolfish, started to gleam from behind the trees in the night, no
one caught at his cross. The eldest one even made an inviting
gesture: the tablecloth would feed everyone if the hag spoke truth.
In the night woods we are all brothers.</p>

<p>When the embracing merchants bellowed obscene
songs, the witch turned to Oleg and Thomas. Her voice fell to a
whisper. “What have you done?”</p>

<p>“And what have you heard?” Oleg asked
back.</p>

<p>The witch paid no heed to him. Her small
sharp eyes were piercing Thomas.“What do thou bear… with thee or in
thee, that thou are spoken about even in the High mountains?”</p>

<p>Thomas hesitated, glanced at sir wonderer.
Oleg said in a louder voice, “What does it matter to you?
Eavesdropping is bad.”</p>

<p>The witch looked him over with disdain. “Tell
me… Are thou with him?”</p>

<p>“I am. What did you hear?”</p>

<p>The witch turned her piercing eyes on the
knight again. “They are rather afraid of something. Bad sound, but
I grasped they were sending to stop you…”</p>

<p>“They came to stop me,” Thomas grunted.</p>

<p>“And what?”</p>

<p>“They’ll come to no other place. Unless
dragged by devils.”</p>

<p>The witch examined him with growing interest.
She ignored the knight’s irritation, Oleg understood why. <emphasis>An
ignorant angel. Just a child, however big and strong he looks. A
capricious, quick-tempered child of the new world. Not the best
one: still a long time before we can see what this world is truly
worth, so now it’s simply new. How can one be angry with a
child?</emphasis> “Very proud words… And thou are not the one who cringes.
That’s laudable.”</p>

<p>“He cringes,” Oleg said venomously. “Before
no dragon but before the cross, bones, splinters, a footprint in
stone… He also spits over shoulder, crosses himself often,
whispers, crooks his fingers behind, scared of something like a
hare.”</p>

<p>“So superstitious?” the witch wondered.</p>

<p>“He also believes in dreams and sneeze, in a
black cat, a woman with empty buckets, a priest on the way, and
Friday, the thirteenth…”</p>

<p>Thomas sniffed angrily. He feared no visible
enemy: God was his witness, as well as the Saracens he’d defeated.
<emphasis>But the faith tells us to be afraid of the invisible enemy, the
Archfiend!</emphasis></p>

<p>The witch snapped her fingers, raised her
hands. Two big broad cups fell from above, the witch caught them
deftly, lest they touch the ground. The brims of those cups were a
dim shimmer in the firelight. Thomas detected that both were bound
with old silver.</p>

<p>Oleg took a cup from her, smirked, glanced at
Thomas. Then looked at the cup again, shook his head when his eyes
met the witch’s. She waved aside with negligence: drink, don’t make
difficulties! Look at your friend who doesn’t mind anything…</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Thomas drained his cup and poured
some rough wine from the jug: the boar was sprinkled with eastern
spices, so the knight’s mouth was burning. He tossed off, then
tasted some mead (he’d got to know its taste and charm in Kiev),
gulped it down with some more wine and filled the cup again at
once.</p>

<p>Oleg had no wish to speak in front of
merchants. <emphasis>They are listening, glancing at each other.</emphasis> In
their trade one may drink, even get drunk, but for the one who
loses head his first trip as a merchant will be his last. And those
were tough, experienced trade wolves. <emphasis>Even too tough for such a
simple market trip from one princedom into another.</emphasis></p>

<p>Anticipating the witch’s new question, Oleg
asked them respectfully, “Oh, you have made a really long way!
You’ve seen countries far away and people overseas! You’ve beheld
with your own eyes what we only know from songs, which the new
faith orders to name byliny. Please tell us about the wonderful
things you’ve seen in your last voyage!”</p>

<p><emphasis>Flattery makes even the wisest one stupid.
For some reason Rod left this to be a human’s vulnerable place, one
of many.</emphasis> The merchant’s sharp eyes went oily and dull at once.
Stroking his luxurious beard, the eldest one said grandly, “We’ve
seen tall towers of Bagdad and the sea as blue as sky. We’ve seen
sands and strange animals. We’ve beheld the world where winter
brings no snow, where people are black like tar or coal! We’ve seen
mighty tribes in which even chieftains walk around naked and eat
humans…”</p>

<p>The witch shook her head. “How awful! Thou
must be lying! Where can such beasts live?”</p>

<p>“Faraway… But the greatest wonder happened on
our way back, across the scorching sands. Our party was few, as
we’d sold everything save three horses, not to mention two carts
with gifts for our kin… The road was said to be safe and empty, so
we let our guards go. There were just a couple of versts to the
city, and we rode, happy with our close return to Rus’…”</p>

<p>He sighed, wiped his forehead. A ghost of
fear flickered in his eyes, as he went through something hard
again. “And when we already could see the city walls, some robbers
attacked us out of the blue. Two dozens of them against the three
of us. Each of us can stand up to two, or even three if he gets
angry, and that’s not a boast, but the third of us was ill then. We
carried him in a cart, and in two we could not…”</p>

<p>“Come on!”</p>

<p>The merchant said with delight, “That would
have been our end if not the marvelous warrior who came at the very
last moment! He was like a menacing lightning in God’s hand. His
stallion was black, with mane and tail flying in the wind, the
sword in his hand shone like the brightest star in the sky of
Bagdad. When he dashed on the villains, the ground moaned and a
flock of black crows soared behind…”</p>

<p>“Which crows?” Thomas didn’t get it.</p>

<p>“The clods of earth thrown up by his
stallion’s hooves! The warrior uttered a scary shout. Many villains
collapsed, and the rest had their legs turned water. And when the
warrior came on them with his sword raised, only five dared to
attack him.”</p>

<p>“Come on,” Thomas asked impatiently.</p>

<p>The merchant took a breath. His chest
straightened proudly, as if it were him fighting those villains.
“He threw all five down with three strikes! I don’t know how he
managed it, but I saw three terrible blows, after which the grass
in ten sazhens around was splashed with blood and the villains lay
like slashed ram carcasses. The hero did not bother to dismount.
Just smiled, wiped his sword, and turned his horse. In vain we
cried after him, wanted to pay homage, offered money and rich gifts
for our miraculous rescue! He didn’t even say his name.
Fortunately, one of us had seen him before and recognized him!”</p>

<p>Thomas asked with respect, “So who was that
marvelous warrior, as much modest as he is valiant? The world has
few knights endowed with such wonderful virtues. I thought all of
them used to sit at the Round Table.”</p>

<p>The merchant said solemnly, “It was Michael
Uryupinets himself!”</p>

<p>The wonderer gave an understanding nod. He
seemed to have heard of this valiant hero. The merchant crossed
himself piously, Thomas did the same. Both looked at each other
with patronizing negligence: what can be expected from a fool?</p>

<p>Actually, each of them looked a boor from the
point of view of another: one made a cross from the right shoulder,
while another from the left. They did not know that the first one
would later be called an Orthodox and the second one a
Catholic.</p>

<p>* * *</p>

<p>With drunken surprise, the merchants peeped
into the winebowls that never grew lighter. Finally, the youngest
man turned one over: a scanty splash of brew came out and vanished
before it could reach the ground. At once the winebowl got empty,
even dry, as if it were held over the fire. The ill-starred
merchant failed to shake even a single drop out. He got it in the
neck, and the second winebowl was now handled with care: they all
but bowed to it.</p>

<p>The boar managed to sate everyone, so quickly
it gained new meat on: juicy and odorous, already roast and larded
with garlic and onions. The eldest one appeared to be the most
enduring: he ate and drank for twelve, loosened his belt, then took
it off. His friends leaned back one by one, fell drunkenly asleep,
one began to snore with a bone in hand. The witch took the bone out
carefully, put into the bag on her belt. Oleg saw it and nodded.
<emphasis>She slipped up. Did not consider the merchants have not the same
toothless gums as hers. Her yellow stubs of teeth would only take
off small fibers of meat, but men’s strong teeth, in search of
marrow, have grinded what the boar can’t be resurrected without.
She’ll have to look for a stronger spell, as getting a new pig is
more difficult. And she may fail in it: the ancient skill of
sorcery is going, and it will never return.</emphasis></p>

<p>When the eldest merchant gave up, fell on his
back and began to snore, only Thomas and Oleg remained by the magic
tablecloth. The witch ate almost nothing, while the knight and the
wonderer satiated themselves in a manly way, unhurried and sedate,
with a skill to get their fill in advance, like old wolves do.</p>

<p>The witch looked sideways: no strange ears,
just merchants sleeping heavily. “So who’s watching you?”</p>

<p>“They were,” Thomas corrected proudly. “Now
devils watch <emphasis>them</emphasis>. And put firewood under their pots.”</p>

<p>“Put where?” the witch didn’t get it.</p>

<p>Oleg explained condescendingly, “It’s from
their doctrine of afterlife. Never mind.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” the witch drawled. “Some new faith?
Well, there were plenty of those… Off chance this one won’t last
too. You’ve crushed some foes, but what about others?”</p>

<p>“No others,” Thomas replied angrily, wounded
by what the witch had said about Christ’s holiest faith. “We’ve
crushed those godless villains.”</p>

<p>“In fact they were Christians,” Oleg did not
fail to sting.</p>

<p>“Crushed <emphasis>all</emphasis>?” the witch
disbelieved.</p>

<p>“Killed the chiefs. And the flock, if they
had any, will disperse. Who’s to come out against us if we defeated
the strongest?”</p>

<p>The witch watched the young knight with
regret: proud and happy he was, in raptures over his victory. He
kept his chest was thrown out and his shoulders squared, as if the
king were already favoring him, presenting with bounties. <emphasis>He
doesn’t know yet that nature abhors a vacuum.</emphasis></p>
