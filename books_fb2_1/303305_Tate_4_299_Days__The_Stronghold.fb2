   <annotation>
    <p><emphasis>299 Days: The Stronghold</emphasis>, the fourth book in the <emphasis>299 Days</emphasis> series, Grant Matson begins teaming up with others who will help the community of Pierce Point become a Patriot stronghold, ready to stand against government Loyalists, the Undecideds and the Oblivious. Using the United States Constitution as their guide, they develop a sense of order and begin planning for a future that shows no sign of improving.</p>
    <p>Outside of Pierce Point, the country continues its downward spiral. The Feds are rationing food and gas and playing favorites while some states are choosing to “opt out” of the Federal Government. Scrappy street gangs have made way for sophisticated white collar gangs who, along with government officials, participate in bartering and bribery of every kind. Vigilantes are loose everywhere, and those working for what is left of the government don’t know if they’re with the good guys or bad guys.</p>
    <p>The Pierce Point Patriots prepare to defend their land, their families, and their beliefs, even if that means going up against those in their community who are loyal to the government and all things that led to the Collapse of America.</p>
    <p>From Chapter One to Chapter 299, this ten-book series follows Grant Matson and others as they navigate through a partial collapse of society. Set in Washington State, this series depicts the conflicting worlds of preppers, those who don’t understand them, and those who fear and resent them.</p>

    <p>About the Author:</p>
   </title>
   <p>Glen Tate has a front row seat to the corruption in government and writes the <emphasis>299 Days</emphasis> series from his first-hand observations of why a collapse is coming and predictions on how it will unfold. Much like the main character in the series, Grant Matson, the author grew up in a rural and remote part of Washington State. He is now a forty-something resident of Olympia, Washington, and is a very active prepper. “Glen” keeps his real identity a secret so he won’t lose his job because, in his line of work, being a prepper and questioning the motives of the government is not appreciated.</p>

    <p>Chapter 108</p>
    <p><emphasis>A Patriot Stronghold</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 10, Year of the Collapse)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The 7:00 p.m. meeting at the Pierce Point Grange did not last long this time. They had gone over everything important the night before. The only new topic tonight was the beach patrol. The gate was the main way for people to come and go into Pierce Point, but the beach was a pretty big area, too. It was still possible for someone to take a boat across the water and land on the beach, go into Pierce Point, steal or kill or whatever they wanted to do, and get back to their boat and escape. It was not out of the question that bad guys could do this, though it was less likely than them trying to drive or walk in at the main gate. Therefore, there still needed to be a security plan.</p>
   <p>A retired Coast Guardsman who lived out at Pierce Point, Shane Eaton, was the natural choice to head up the beach patrol. He was a Master Chief Boatswain’s Mate, a guy who spent thirty years running small craft and working on maritime security and rescue. His last station was Seattle and he retired in Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Master Chief Eaton, who everyone called “Chief,” was glad to be needed again. The past four years of retirement had been hard on him. He spent the years fishing and running his boats around the inlet, but he missed the action. He loved saving lives. The military part of the Coast Guard—boarding ships, maritime law enforcement, and the “gun side” of the Coast Guard—never appealed to him much. He was a boat guy, but he could see that with all that was happening that there was a need for the “gun side.”</p>
   <p>Several men and one woman volunteered for the beach patrol. They were experienced boaters and lived in houses and cabins on the beach, which gave them a personal stake in the security.</p>
   <p>Paul also raised his hand when the call for volunteers went out for the beach patrol. He had been boating the waters around Pierce Point since he was a boy. He knew the tides well and loved being on a boat. He figured he could finish up his work fabricating the gate and then work with Chief on the beach patrol.</p>
   <p>There weren’t many new people showing up at the meetings. Some people who didn’t show were likely sitting at their homes in denial about all that was happening around them. For others, it could have been about the gas. Gas was scarce, and the Grange was at least a mile from most people; it was up to three miles from some. It appeared that a few regulars would attend the meetings and then report back to their neighbors.</p>
   <p>It was 7:45 p.m. and the Grange ladies were making dinner for the guards and the Team. Grant had this overwhelming feeling that he needed to talk to Rich about politics, and about turning Pierce Point into a Patriot stronghold. He thought it was still far too early to start talking to the residents of Pierce Point about this, but Rich would be ready. After all, his plan was to first get people on a solid footing to survive and then work on them slowly so they turned into Patriots without even knowing it. Talking to Rich so early in this was contrary to Grant’s plan of slow and silent politics, but Grant knew he needed to do it soon. He was learning to trust these instincts, even when they seemed crazy.</p>
   <p>As they were eating a great home cooked dinner—which seemed to taste even better given how hungry they were after a long day of physical activity—Grant came up to Rich.</p>
   <p>“Hey, man, I need to talk to you,” Grant said. He looked around to see if anyone was listening. “Us alone,” Grant said. “It’s not bad news. In fact, I think it’s good news. You drink?”</p>
   <p>“Alcohol?” Rich asked. “Yeah, sure.”</p>
   <p>“OK, I’ll stick around after everyone leaves and we can have a drink,” Grant said with a smile.</p>
   <p>Grant had kept a bottle of his favorite whiskey, Pendleton, out at his cabin. It was a cowboy whiskey they drank in eastern Washington. He first had Pendleton about two years before, when he was visiting with an outspoken state legislator and Patriot leader, John Trappford, at his ranch where they hunted coyotes. Grant and Senator Trappford sat outside for hours on a beautiful night and, over most of a bottle of Pendleton, both came to the conclusion that the state was collapsing.</p>
   <p>Grant remembered that conversation because Trappford had said, “This state will collapse. Soon. It’ll be ugly.” This was coming from a legislator, a guy with inside information and someone who had a stake in things not collapsing. And even he knew a collapse was imminent. That conversation just cemented Grant’s own feelings that it was coming. Grant wondered if Trappford had been put in jail yet, but he couldn’t think about that now. He had things to do in Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>That morning, in anticipation of this conversation with Rich, Grant had put his bottle of Pendleton in his day pack and kept it in Mark’s truck. He went and got it, and then came back to the Grange and just sat quietly for the first time in days. It felt a little weird to be relaxing. There was no crisis to fight right that minute. Grant almost felt guilty for relaxing. But, with a full stomach after a long day and a bottle of Pendleton ready to go, he got over the guilty feeling pretty quickly and prepared for a good night. He looked forward to this conversation with Rich because it was important business.</p>
   <p>Once Rich was done talking to people and arranging for the guard shifts, the Grange had cleared out and he and Grant were alone. It was strangely quiet there. Rich looked tired. He looked frazzled, like people had been talking to him non-stop for days, which they actually had.</p>
   <p>Rich sat down by Grant and said, “So what is it we need to talk about?” He was a little apprehensive that Grant wanted to have a private conversation.</p>
   <p>Grant pulled out the bottle of Pendleton and smiled, which made Rich even more apprehensive. What kind of a conversation required whiskey?</p>
   <p>Grant had a glass for each of them. He poured a shot in each glass. Grant said, “Rich, I feel like I don’t even know you. We’re going to be working together until this whole shit storm is over so I wanted to have a drink with you. It’s the best way to get to know someone.”</p>
   <p>“Yep, I was thinking the same thing,” Rich said. He, too, would be trusting his life to this Grant guy; he might as well find out about him over a few drinks.</p>
   <p>Over the next hour or so, and several more shots each, they talked about their families, their former careers, their hopes for the future that had been ruined by the Collapse, and then finally, their hopes for Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>“My basic goal out here,” a very buzzed Grant said, “is to survive and for my entire family to make it. Everything after that is just icing on the cake.”</p>
   <p>“Me, too,” said Rich, also buzzed. “I’m not any kind of hero. I’m just a guy who has some experience keeping people safe, and I know people out here. Running the security here just came naturally.”</p>
   <p>“Rich, I want to propose that we have a plan for doing more than just surviving out here,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>This is what the conversation is all about, Rich thought.</p>
   <p>“What do you have in mind?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“You’re an Oath Keeper, right?” Grant asked, even though he already knew the answer.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I have been for over four years. From what I’ve gathered you’re some kind of Patriot lawyer or something,” Rich said. “Patriot” and “lawyer” sounded strange in the same sentence.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said. “I’m POI. Guess that’s something to be proud of,” Grant said with a smile. It was a warm smile from a guy with several shots of whiskey in him.</p>
   <p>“Let me get right to it, Rich,” he said. “I want to guide Pierce Point into becoming a Patriot stronghold.” He let that sink in a while. He was watching for Rich’s reaction.</p>
   <p>Rich sat and thought about it. “How do we do that?” he asked.</p>
   <p>So far, so good, Grant thought. Rich hadn’t dismissed the idea and had asked how “we” can do it.</p>
   <p>“Slowly,” Grant said, “and fairly and practically. Here’s what I mean,” Grant said. “Survival is my number one goal and yours. So, survival comes first.”</p>
   <p>Rich nodded.</p>
   <p>“But politics—God, I hate that word—is a way to help us survive,” Grant said. “By ‘politics,’ I don’t mean the old politics of…”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I know. You don’t mean the government,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, exactly,” Grant said. “By politics, I mean we take care of people who are like us, who want freedom, who don’t want to get through this only to go back to the shit that got us here in the first place. You know?”</p>
   <p>Rich nodded again.</p>
   <p>“We don’t march around with a Don’t Tread on Me flag, or give long speeches about the Constitution,” Grant said. “We take care of people. We help them eat. We fix their boats. We give them medical care. We give them hope. We’re practical. But the practical way to solve our problems is that we live in freedom. Freedom works. We have limited government out here, a voluntary government that is made up of ourselves.”</p>
   <p>Grant let that sink in and continued. “I guess I’m saying that we have a little republic out here. It’s the best and most practical way to take care of things and allow us to survive. People need to buy into the program. Know what I’m sayin’?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah,” Rich agreed, “I see what you’re sayin’.” He thought some more. “I never really thought about a mini republic out here, but I never had a reason to think about it. There had always been a government, so there was never an opportunity to have our own system. You know, we’ve already been doing what you’re talking about. I mean, look at the guards. No one deputized them. No one charged taxes to pay them. No one wrote up tons of laws—no offense to a lawyer—and made us go through hoops to protect ourselves. We did it on our own because it made sense.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly!” Grant replied. “That’s exactly what I’m talking about. I think we keep doing things like that on our own. We don’t call it a republic, but we think of it that way. Citizens need to contribute to the republic, whether it’s guard duty or helping their neighbors or picking apples in the fall. It’s hunting and sharing the meat. It’s making food at the Grange for guards. No one is telling anyone what to do, they’re just doing it. And then—presto—we’re a Patriot stronghold. Know why? We’re a Patriot stronghold because we don’t need the government. That’s why.” Grant poured another shot into both of their glasses.</p>
   <p>Rich looked at the whiskey and asked, “But if we’re a Patriot stronghold, won’t that be a threat to the government? Won’t they want to come here and put us down? That ain’t a good survival move, to pick a fight with the United States government.”</p>
   <p>“True,” Grant said, pointing his finger in the air to show he acknowledged that. “But there isn’t a United States government, anymore. Maybe on paper. Maybe in Olympia,” Grant waved his arms around, “But not out here. You see any government? We’re it.”</p>
   <p>Rich thought for a while. Grant was right. They were the closest thing to government out there. “Besides,” Rich finally said, “I don’t think we have a choice. It’s not like we can pledge our loyalty to the government and they’ll take care of us. They can’t even take care of themselves. We’re on our own.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “So, OK, we’re Patriots out here. I get that. But what do we do with Loyalists? Kill them? I ain’t shootin’ my neighbors, especially over politics.” Rich had a good point.</p>
   <p>“No,” Grant said, “we don’t shoot them for being Loyalists. We are practical. If they don’t work for the community, they don’t get the help of the community. I know that sounds socialist, but our republic out here is voluntary, so it’s not socialist, because socialists rule by force. It’s voluntary here. If you choose to be a Loyalist and look to the old government and not Pierce Point for police protection and food, be our guest. See how far that gets you. If you love the old government, then you can’t receive our help and we won’t expect anything from you. Loyalists are on their own,” Grant said and then smiled, “See how long you last.”</p>
   <p>He paused and said, “That’s how we do it. Loyalists—true Loyalists—will leave here. Soft Loyalists will get hungry and get with the program. Whether or not they really share our view of the Constitution, they will either get with the program or they won’t be a problem for us. They can hate us and still be a part of the mini republic. There’s no need to shoot them.”</p>
   <p>That was what Rich needed to know. Was this Grant guy—who was some sort of Patriot activist before the Collapse—trying to turn Pierce Point into a politically pure dictatorship that did not tolerate dissent? With Grant as the dictator? Rich knew that if anyone, even a guy like Grant whom he liked, tried to do that then Rich would have to fight them. And that he had the firepower to win. He suspected Grant would feel the same way if Rich tried to create a dictatorship. Rich’s guards and Grant’s Team were a natural check and balance on each other, and all the well-armed residents were a check on both. It was a perfect little republic.</p>
   <p>Rich was feeling warm and good right now. So was Grant. Perhaps it was the whiskey, or perhaps it was because they just realized what a great system they could help create at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to reassure Rich that people wouldn’t be targeted merely because of their politics. “Rich, if a Loyalist does anything criminal, like steal from someone or hurt someone, then we deal with them like we would anyone else. Jail for stealing and for threatening people. If they hurt someone, especially murder or rape, well…” Grant made the motion for slitting a throat.</p>
   <p>“Agreed,” Rich said. “But Loyalists get treated like anyone else, alright?” Rich said with a slight edge to his voice. This was an important thing for him. As well it should be, Grant thought.</p>
   <p>“Agreed,” said Grant. They shook hands.</p>

    <p>Chapter 109</p>
    <p><emphasis>Crime and Punishment</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 10)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said to Grant, picking up their Pendleton whiskey-influenced discussion, “you talked about jail and the death penalty for crimes. How would we do that?” Rich had been meaning to get a plan together for a jail and—this sounded so weird—a court system out there. Was he being premature? Or would this be necessary before they knew it?</p>
   <p>Grant thought. “Well, first we have simple laws. Stealing is jail time that goes up with how serious the theft is. Same for assault. Rape is the death penalty and, of course, so is murder. That way, people know the general price they will pay. When it comes to the specifics, like how much jail time, we let a jury of our neighbors decide the exact amount of jail time. And restitution: if you steal, you have to pay back the person three times as much. I think that’s in the Bible or something. Not that I want to turn this into a religious theocracy, but that three-times thing makes a lot of sense. Practical sense. It means crime won’t pay.”</p>
   <p>Rich was glad to hear that Grant wasn’t one of the religious people who wanted to do everything by the Bible. Rich was a Christian and thought the Bible was a great guide for life, but not an instruction book dictating everything for every detail of running a society.</p>
   <p>Rich asked, “I know how to run a jail, but where do we put it?” They talked for a few minutes and decided that having it at the Grange wouldn’t work because that was already shaping up to be a central location for the community. In addition, Rich planned on keeping extra guns there in a makeshift armory, which made having prisoners right next to the armory a bad idea. Rich suggested an abandoned house a few hundred yards from the Grange. They could get a couple of the less fit guard volunteers to be the jail guards and use the older and overweight volunteers for jail guard duty.</p>
   <p>“How do we feed them?” Grant asked. “I mean, I know we need to feed them, but I don’t want scarce food to go to prisoners. Explain that one to hungry residents. People will decide to steal and then get free meals.”</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s a problem,” Rich said. “We have to feed them something. Maybe we’ll have them work for their meals. If they’re too dangerous or it becomes too hard to guard them, they just stay in the jail. Maybe we feed them the food no one else wants. Hey, maybe we have them test food that’s beyond expiration dates. Sounds cruel to use prisoners for human experiments, but hey…”</p>
   <p>“Sounds good to me,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“OK, we have a plan for the jail,” Rich said. “What about the death penalty?”</p>
   <p>“I hope we don’t have to find out,” Grant said, “but odds are that we will.” Grant had actually thought about this quite a bit, but didn’t want to appear morbid to Rich. “I read a great survival novel called <emphasis>One Second After</emphasis>. In it, they had a court system kinda like we’re talking about. They had a judge, but he didn’t execute people. The idea was that the guy imposing the sentence shouldn’t be affected by the fact that he has to do the deed—whether he likes it too much or hates it. So, they drew lots from volunteers and the volunteer shot the convicted person. Although, I think hanging would be a better way. It’s more civilized.”</p>
   <p>“OK, we hang them,” Rich said. “We have a judge. I guess that’s you, since you’re the only lawyer we have out here.”</p>
   <p>Grant knew that he would be the judge. He didn’t want to do it—he didn’t want to mistakenly punish an innocent person—but he had special skills and training and could perform a job no one else out there could. “Yep, I’m the judge unless anyone else wants to do it,” Grant said. “I’ll be elected, I guess.”</p>
   <p>Grant thought a little more and said, “The guiding principle, besides fairness, is the Constitution. We honor the Fourth Amendment prohibition on unreasonable searches. We respect people’s property. We even honor the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, as much of a pain in the ass as that is. People have the right to confront their accuser.”</p>
   <p>Grant started going through the Bill of Rights by memory. “OK,” he continued, “no cruel and unusual punishment, either, which is, I seem to recall, the Eighth Amendment. Jail time and hanging is not cruel and unusual punishment for a serious crime. Having hungry people test expiration dates on food isn’t cruel in my book—they should be glad to get any food at all if they’ve stolen or hurt someone. Let’s see. Oh, people have a Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial. That’s a big one.”</p>
   <p>“A jury shouldn’t be too hard to come by,” Rich said. “We call on adults who are not directly connected with the defendant. We give them lunch. That’ll draw them in.”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said. “As the judge, I would make sure the jury is a fair one. No one can be on the jury who is related to the defendant or has a beef with them. I’ll need local people who know everyone to help me with that since I don’t know all the connections people have out here.”</p>
   <p>Grant thought for a moment and then said, “Hey, I know how we can draw random people for jury duty. The lot numbers. Draw them from a hat so people can see this is fair.”</p>
   <p>Rich liked that. “Yeah, fair is the key to this. People have to see everything we’re doing. The process has to be open for public view. People are so disgusted by the way the old government did things with favors for people and groups that we need to be extra transparent and fair.”</p>
   <p>Exactly, Grant thought. Man, he and Rich were like two peas in a pod.</p>
   <p>“We’ll have simple rules of evidence,” Grant said. “No hearsay testimony, but other than that, we have simple, common-sense trials so we find out what happened and people can understand what we’re doing and why.” This is how Grant thought the justice system should be. It was how it used to be before a billion lawyers and bureaucrats created a zillion laws that no one could possibly understand.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “We have a chance to start over with a new justice system. A tiny little justice system here at Pierce Point. It will be opposite of all the corrupt shit I saw in the old government’s system. We will build the new system our way, the fair way, guided directly by the Constitution. People will see that Patriots have a better system and will gravitate toward it.”</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” Rich said, feeling the Pendleton in him. “We’re decent to people, we solve problems, we’re Patriots—pretty soon, everyone will want to be a Patriot,” he said with a big grin. He and Grant were on the same page. Thank God.</p>
   <p>Grant was thinking about the other parts of governing other than the justice system. They had the medical down: Lisa, the nurses, and EMT would provide free services. Donations were encouraged, but they wouldn’t turn anyone away.</p>
   <p>“What about taxes?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Taxes?” Rich asked. “Are you crazy?”</p>
   <p>“No, not taxes like the government has been doing,” Grant said. “‘Taxes’ was a poor choice of words. I mean, how do people contribute for what they’re getting, like the security? How do we keep the things we are doing for people going?” He made a mental note to never use the word “taxes” again.</p>
   <p>“I dunno,” said Rich. “No one has any money; we couldn’t spend it on anything, anyway, and I ain’t asking anyone for their money.”</p>
   <p>“No,” Grant said, “I mean people should give things to the effort. Whatever they can spare. Nothing formal, but I’d like a way to prevent slackers from just leaching off of the rest of us. You know—all the leaching that got us in the situation we’re in.” Grant decided against it, but wanted to say, “Don’t kid yourself. We’re in a rural semi-self-reliant area, but there are plenty of welfare shitbags out here, too. Like everywhere in America.”</p>
   <p>Both Rich and Grant were quiet for a minute, thinking. Nothing was coming to mind.</p>
   <p>Rich spoke. “Maybe we keep it pretty informal. We just mentally keep track of who is contributing. Maybe we worry about it if we don’t have enough to feed the guards.”</p>
   <p>Mentally keeping track of things wasn’t good enough. Grant said, “We could keep a formal record of what people are contributing and give them public acknowledgment for it. Encourage good behavior. My father-in-law, Drew, is a former accountant. He’s inventorying things for us on Over Road. He could keep track of things people donate.”</p>
   <p>Rich said, “Hey, my wife is a bookkeeper. She and Drew could keep track of who’s contributing and what they’re providing. I like the idea of rewarding good behavior.”</p>
   <p>“If supplies get tight,” Grant said, knowing that they would, “we can look at who’s not carrying their weight and decide what to do. Of course, we will take care of the old, disabled, and those who can’t take care of themselves. But able-bodied freeloaders will be a problem. Those contributing will be pissed at them, but I’m not sure how we can cut people off of security services or medical care. That’s a community-wide thing. Maybe there will be other things we can offer to people and withhold from non-contributors.” It sounded cruel, but this was a survival situation.</p>
   <p>Rich thought some more. “You know, I bet a lot of this works itself out. I know most of the people out here. They will share with neighbors and work to help each other, for the most part. They’ve had to do this over the past few years with the economy.”</p>
   <p>Rich paused and looked at Grant. “You know, most people are still pretty decent. A few aren’t. We let the majority work together on their own, and we deal with the minority. Be a decent human being and you won’t have any trouble from us.”</p>
   <p>Grant laughed, “That could be our motto.”</p>
   <p>Rich laughed. He realized they had polished off about half that bottle of whiskey. He was feeling it.</p>
   <p>“I think I should head home,” he said, jingling his keys. “We need to have a law against drunk driving. We’ll put it into effect <emphasis>tomorrow</emphasis>.” They laughed.</p>
   <p>“Nah, I’m kidding,” Rich said. “I have a cot here. I’m fine. A couple hours of napping and I’ll be fine. My wife is used to me being here all night sometimes. How are you getting home? Mark left a couple of hours ago. I can call my wife.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t waste the gas,” Grant said. “I’ll walk. It’s only about two miles. I need to stay in shape. And it’s a beautiful night, the stars are out, I have my walking companion,” Grant said pointing to his AR leaning against the wall nearby, “and I have a buzz. Perfect walking conditions.”</p>
   <p>Grant and Rich shook hands. This was a great partnership. They were exactly the right people to be leading this community. They had a plan.</p>
   <p>Grant left and started walking…home. “Home.” That’s right. Not to the “cabin,” but to “home.” Wow. He let that sink in.</p>
   <p>The walk home was one of the best of Grant’s life. He thought about how all the “coincidences” were coming together and how they might actually make it out there at Pierce Point. He thought about how he just knew that he needed to talk to Rich that night, how he brought the whiskey that seemed to lubricate this important conversation, and how they were on the same page. He kept thinking about the mini republic at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>A mini republic. It wouldn’t be easy to pull off. He remembered that famous line from Ben Franklin. When he was leaving the 1787 Constitutional Convention, a woman asked him what they had created. “A republic. If you can keep it,” he said. Human beings seemed to love tyranny for some reason. No, it would be more accurate to say that they feared freedom and settled for tyranny, especially soft tyranny where they were taken care of. It would be hard to make a republic work, even a small one.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about this Pierce Point mini republic and his life. He had spent his adult years seeing the corruption and injustice and learning how <emphasis>not</emphasis> to run a society. Now they had a chance to start all over again and do it the right way. A mini republic.</p>
   <p><emphasis>This is just a dress rehearsal out here. For something bigger.</emphasis></p>

    <p><emphasis>Funeral Planning</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant was in such a good mood walking back from the Grange. Maybe this Collapse thing wasn’t so bad after all. They would get to rebuild things better—way better—than they were before. Grant’s family had supplies and they were in a good place. This new world was kind of fun.</p>
   <p>It was a little after midnight when he came up on the guard shack on Over Road. He didn’t want to get shot by mistake, so he made loud walking sounds as he rounded the corner and headed down Over Road. He said loudly, “Grant here” and put up his hands. He heard John say, “Got you.” John could see Grant’s outline in the big light at the end of the road. He didn’t point his 30-30 at Grant, but had a round in the chamber and kept it at the ready.</p>
   <p>As Grant got a few feet from him, John said, “Bad news, Grant. Mrs. Roth died a few hours ago. Mary Anne has been crying nonstop.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, that’s terrible,” Grant said. “Lisa said this would be coming soon, but it’s always a shock when it does.” He looked and the light was on in John and Mary Anne’s house.</p>
   <p>“John, you go be with her. I’ve got guard duty,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Thanks.” John turned and left. As he was going to his house, Chip was coming from it and toward the guard shack.</p>
   <p>Chip came up to Grant and said, “Have you heard about Mrs. Roth?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah. Bummer,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“I thought I’d do some guard duty,” Chip said. “To be honest, I don’t like being in a house with a crying woman. Reminds me of my first marriage.”</p>
   <p>That was interesting. Grant didn’t know that Chip had been married before, or even a couple of times.</p>
   <p>He realized that he and Chip hadn’t really had time to talk much in the past few days. They’d been so busy.</p>
   <p>Grant was hungry. He’d been up all night and had been walking. He didn’t want to wake anyone up, though.</p>
   <p>“Dude, I’m starving. It’ll be a long time before breakfast,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>Chip fished around the guard shack and pulled out two brown plastic packages.</p>
   <p>“Beef ravioli or chicken with salsa?” he asked with a grin. MREs. Chip must have stashed some of his out here.</p>
   <p>“Hmmm…beef ravioli,” Grant said. “Not sure a midnight snack is the best use of food that can store for fifteen years, but I’m pretty damned hungry.”</p>
   <p>Chip said, “Chicken with salsa for me, then.”</p>
   <p>They opened their MREs. Grant’s had beef jerky, fruit, crackers, jalapeno cheese spread, and, the prize of prizes, a fudge brownie. Chip had Mexican rice, which was pretty good, crackers, jalapeño cheese spread, short bread, and prize of prizes, Skittles.</p>
   <p>“Dang, an MRE kicks ass, especially when you’re hungry,” Chip said. He was right. That meal was fantastic. Grant’s stomach was growling as he ate.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“So, Chip, you have a family out here now, don’t you?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Chip said with a smile. “Yep, I do.”</p>
   <p>“Hey, remember when I first came into Capitol City Guns? Did you ever think we’d be doing this?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Not at all. Not at all,” Chip said and then changed the subject. “Hey, what are we going to do with those goodies in the basement?”</p>
   <p>Grant had almost forgotten about the ARs and ammo that Chip brought from the gun store before the looting started back in Olympia.</p>
   <p>“I dunno,” Grant said, “but I have a sneaking suspicion that we’ll find a use for them.” He had more than a sneaking suspicion. He knew exactly how they’d use them but the time wasn’t right to spring that on Chip. The guns were, after all, Chip’s, and they were worth their weight in gold right now.</p>
   <p>“Who knows,” Chip said casually, “Perhaps a friend will show up and have a use for them.” Chip was looking off in the distance, down Over Road.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Grant knew what Chip meant and who the friend was, but he didn’t want to blurt it out. Subtlety was required in situations like these. One doesn’t openly talk about these things, even with people they trust. Blabbers get people killed. Besides, Grant didn’t want to be wrong and have Chip laugh at him. Or be offended that Grant had a plan for Chip’s valuable goods that Chip didn’t agree with.</p>
   <p>Grant and Chip spent the rest of the night talking about everything and nothing. It was great to be talking to an old friend, especially with a good buzz going. All the problems were far away. Grant was where he wanted to be with the people he wanted to be with. He couldn’t ask for much more than that.</p>
   <p>The sun started coming up, along with the sound of birds chirping. There was a very distinctive early morning bird chirp in western Washington. Every time Grant heard it, he was reminded of good times. He recalled searches he went on while in CAP, camping trips, late night drinking in college. All good memories.</p>
   <p>“Well, we have a funeral to plan,” Grant said. He knew that this was an important community event, not just a way to honor Mrs. Roth and saw it as a chance to show the community that he and the other leaders were providing important services to the community. He could show them that the Patriot way was the best way.</p>
   <p>John walked up to the guard shack with a cup of coffee. He probably didn’t get much sleep the previous night, either, with Mary Anne being so upset.</p>
   <p>After exchanging “good mornings” and inquiries about Mary Anne’s emotional state, Grant said, “I’ll get the funeral going. Right after I sleep.”</p>
   <p>Grant went as quietly as possible into the cabin and slept on the couch; he didn’t want to wake Lisa.</p>
   <p>He opened his eyes about two hours later when Manda was up and starting the pancakes. He talked to her for a bit and then got the CB that they kept in the cabin. He got Rich on the line, which required a walk up to the top of the hill to get decent reception. He was tired and starting to have a very mild hangover. He hadn’t drank much in the past few years and it didn’t take much anymore to give him a fuzzy head the morning after.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Rich,” Grant said when he slowly got to the top of the hill overlooking the water near his cabin, “sorry to wake you but we have a funeral to plan. Mrs. Roth down here died. Hey, can we use the Grange for this?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, sure,” Rich replied. “The one thing we don’t have is a mortician here. Could we get away with using a wood box that’s covered up? A quick burial before…things break down without embalming fluids?” Rich was grossed out by what he was saying.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Grant said. “Do we have any clergy out here?”</p>
   <p>“Not really.” Rich said. “There’s Pastor Pete. What’s his name…Peter Edmonds, I think. He tried to start a church out here but there wasn’t enough interest. Most people who go to church—and that’s not too many—go to ones in Frederickson. He was a mechanic supervisor at the Ford dealership in town before it closed, but studies theology. Nice guy. Not a Bible thumper. He lives by me. I’ll go by his place after breakfast and call you back.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Grant said. “Who can make the box?” Before Rich could answer, Grant said, “How about John Morrell? He’s a carpenter and his wife, Mary Anne, was taking care of Mrs. Roth.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds good,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“See you up at the Grange in a couple hours,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Roger that,” Rich said and then said, “Out.” Talking on a radio was different than talking on a phone, but it was helpful to make sure the messages were clear.</p>
   <p>Grant went to find John. Grant didn’t know how John would react to his request, but there was only one way to find out.</p>
   <p>“John,” Grant said, “we probably will have more of these…events. I don’t think we’ll necessarily have enough wood for all the coffins. We might need to ‘recycle’ them. Could you make one that’s big enough for most people? We can use the coffin for the funeral and bury people straight into the ground without the coffin. Sorry, but…”</p>
   <p>“No need to be sorry,” John said. “It’s practical. Besides, I never understood $5,000 coffins back when we had $5,000 to waste on such things.”</p>
   <p>“Any thoughts on a place for a cemetery?” Grant asked, realizing how serious this whole thing was. With so many people cut off from their medications, like Mrs. Roth, Grant was afraid several people would be dying. Planning a cemetery would force the community to confront that reality.</p>
   <p>John thought. “There’s a vacant lot on top of the hill overlooking the water. It’s right off the road leading here, so people could stop and visit graves. I don’t know who owns it, but it’s been vacant for years.”</p>
   <p>Grant suggested they could figure that out by using the map with the lot numbers.</p>
   <p>“If it’s owned by someone who hasn’t made it out here yet, they just donated the land,” Grant said. Of course, to be the good Patriot role models they were striving to be, Grant would make sure that an owner of the land who could actually be located would be compensated for the land by the community. They could make sure some of the deceased’s property went to the people who owned the cemetery property. Something like that: simple, but fair.</p>
   <p>As Grant walked back down to the cabin, he realized that he needed to get to the Grange, but he didn’t want to use all the gas that Mark’s truck would burn. He had walked home from the Grange a few hours ago, been up most of the night, and was coming off a buzz. It wasn’t exactly prime strolling conditions.</p>
   <p>When Grant got back to the guard shack, he asked John, “Hey, anyone around here have a bike or something?”</p>
   <p>John thought. “Oh, yeah, the Sharpes up on Covington have a couple of mopeds. Their teenage kids ride them around in the summer. Would you like me to introduce you to them?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said. “I might need to borrow them.”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” John said as he motioned for Grant to follow him. Grant, who was wearing his tactical vest and carrying his AR, would not force the Sharpes to give up their mopeds, but he sure hoped they would. A moped was a perfect way for one person to get somewhere using very little gas. Grant thought that he should have got one for his preps. With gas prices going up like they had, moped prices went up, too, since so many people were riding them to save money. Oh well, you can’t prepare for everything. Someone in Pierce Point would hopefully loan the security guys the mopeds they needed. It wasn’t exactly badass to patrol on a moped, but it beat walking.</p>
   <p>The sun was fully up by now. It was beautiful. During the walk, Grant noticed deer paths and fruit trees that he usually missed when he drove past them.</p>
   <p>They got to the Sharpes’ house, which was up on the hill overlooking near where he had made the CB transmission. A dog barked and a man came out and waved to John. He introduced Grant to Mr. Sharpe (John had forgotten his first name) and Grant explained why he needed the moped.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” said Mr. Sharpe. “We have two. My kids like riding them, but I’m not sure where we will get the gas for them now. They go a week or so on a gallon of gas, but even that gallon is hard to come by now. Besides, you guys are protecting us,” Mr. Sharpe said to Grant. “My neighbors said you guys were a SEAL team. Is that true?”</p>
   <p>Grant laughed. “No, sir. The only seals I’ve been around were in a zoo, eating fish that a trainer threw at them.” But Grant didn’t want Mr. Sharpe to think they had no security, so he added, “But we know how to use these things,” he said, pointing to his AR slung across his chest.</p>
   <p>“Great,” Mr. Sharpe said. He was glad to have well-armed guys around who seemed to be nice. A friend of John’s must be an OK guy.</p>
   <p>“Happy to help,” Mr. Sharpe said. “My oldest boy is eighteen. He’s driving me crazy just sitting around like he is. Can you guys put his lazy ass to work?”</p>
   <p>“You bet,” Grant said. “Have him come up to the Grange today and we’ll get him a job.” They talked about the skills his son had, which weren’t too many, but he knew guns, so it looked they had found a new guard for the gate. John assured Grant that the eighteen year-old Sharpe boy was a good kid.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sharpe went into the house and brought back two helmets and two keys. “There’s probably a half tank in each. You know how to use one of these?” Grant had ridden one in college.</p>
   <p>After showing Grant all the controls, which weren’t many, Mr. Sharpe said, “Hey, John, you can ride the second one to wherever you need to go. They’re yours. When things get back to normal, I’d like them back, and please repair them if you break them.”</p>
   <p>“No problem,” Grant said. This would be the first donation for Drew to record in his records. “A guy named Drew will be coming by sometime, not sure when, to record your donations here. We’re keeping track of who’s contributing to the community. Thanks again.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Recording contributions seemed like a good idea to Mr. Sharpe. It made sense to give people credit for what they’re doing, like he was by donating the mopeds.</p>
   <p>Mr. Sharpe waved and went back in the house. John and Grant put the helmets on and got on the mopeds to head back home.</p>
   <p>As they came down Over Road toward the guard shack, Chip gave them the thumbs up and smiled at the mopeds. The noise of the little engines brought the Team out of the yellow cabin. They were smiling, too. Their transportation problem had just been solved.</p>
   <p>Most people were already eating breakfast by the time Grant and John got back to the cabin. Breakfast was oatmeal or pancakes. Grant chose oatmeal and added hot cocoa mix to it, a combination Grant learned in Civil Air Patrol that they called “chocolatey-oat goodness.” Grant liked pancakes better but, by choosing oatmeal, he was stretching their limited amount of pancake mix some more. Eileen had been thinking the same thing about the pancake mix and asked Grant if she should start using the biscuit mix in the morning to make biscuits.</p>
   <p>“One of Mary Anne’s friends is a bee keeper and offered us honey,” Eileen said. “That would be great on biscuits.” Grant’s mouth literally started watering at the thought of real honey on biscuits.</p>
   <p>Tammy was at Grant’s cabin for breakfast and updated everyone on what was happening at the power company. She had to leave soon to get to work, but said, “The director said some federal people came by and told him that we might need to consider cutting off utilities to various places. It almost sounded like the shut offs were political because the feds said the FCorps would be telling us specifically who to shut off.” Everyone was shocked. They hadn’t prepared themselves for the loss of electricity. In fact, they’d got pretty used to having it as the one stable luxury during this entire catastrophe.</p>
   <p>“My boss,” Tammy continued, “said that he wouldn’t shut off anyone, not now, and not with everything that people are dealing with. The Feds left. My boss told us not to shut off anyone, not even if they hadn’t paid their bills. Which is funny because no one is paying their bills.”</p>
   <p>Tammy, who had heard about the mopeds during breakfast, turned to Grant and said, “Guess who has a full tank of gas, courtesy of the power company? If you have a hose, I have the gas for the mopeds.” Tammy could also get diesel by driving to work in Mark’s truck, which ran on diesel, and filling it up every week, or so.</p>
   <p>John said, “I can siphon off some. I have some gas cans to put it in. Just so everyone knows, these cans are reserved for moped gas, OK?” Everyone was fine with that.</p>
   <p>It was time for the Team to go up to the Grange for the day. They went to the yellow cabin to get into their gear and kit up, which included their tactical vests with ammunition magazines, a Camelbak water bladder on their backs, a small trauma first aid kit, a flashlight, extra batteries, and miscellaneous things, like gloves, sunscreen, and a shemagh, which was a Middle Eastern scarf that had multiple uses.</p>
   <p>Chip, who had also been up most of the night, would stay behind and take a nap. So would Grant, who was feeling his age after staying up all night and walking a few miles with guns, ammo and a good buzz. A nap would freshen him up.</p>
   <p>Manda was overseeing Cole and Missy in the after-breakfast cleanup. After that, they were going to the “Pirate Cave,” which was a little cove in the bank along the beach. Then it was sweeping the decks of the houses and cabin and seeing if Drew needed any errands run. At Pierce Point, “errands” meant walking a piece of paper to a neighbor’s house or going over to someone’s house and telling them something. The kids would also pick up pinecones and put them in garbage bags for winter fuel. It took them about twice as long to do things as it took adults, but that was fine. They were occupying themselves and getting some things done, which made them feel helpful.</p>
   <p>Although the kids were useful to the adults in their new roles, they also couldn’t let education go by the wayside. Mary Anne, the retired teacher, had been thinking about this and had planned to attend the Grange meeting to ask if the community wanted to start up a school in the fall, but Mrs. Roth’s death had interrupted that.</p>
   <p>After Lisa was ready to go to “work,” Pow came over with his kit on. They were ready to go, so they piled into Mark’s truck. They waited a minute or two and then Lisa got into the cab. Grant felt that there was something so civilizing about letting a lady ride up front.</p>
   <p>As they were pulling out, Pow looked at the guys in the back of the truck and said, “Beats the shit out of selling insurance.”</p>
   <p>They went up to the Grange where Lisa met up with her medical team and they started going over how to turn two rooms of the Grange into a medical clinic. They kept saying, “What we really need is some…” The list of things they needed was long.</p>
   <p>Cindy, the former renal nurse who knew all the nurses and others at the Frederickson Hospital, decided that they needed to go on a run into town to get medical supplies. She talked to Rich about how to do that safely.</p>
   <p>The day’s plan for the Team was for them to patrol the areas around the Grange first. This would get the Team out to meet people. Ryan would come with them; he was a local guy who the residents would probably know.</p>
   <p>Ryan was starting to fit into the Team. He was a combat vet and his skills could be used on the SWAT part of the community’s security force. More than his experience, though, was the fact that he was a quiet and calm professional. He wasn’t a gung-ho brute; he was a sheepdog, like all the other guys on the Team.</p>
   <p>Rich realized that he would need Drew, who was back at his cabin, to go out with the Team to take down information on each lot number. Grant wasn’t at the Grange, either. They would need both of them. And Chip wasn’t there, either.</p>
   <p>“Grant and Chip are taking a nap,” Scotty told Rich. “They did guard duty last night.”</p>
   <p>“At the gate?” Rich asked. He knew who was on guard duty at the gate and it wasn’t them.</p>
   <p>“Nope,” Scotty said. “At our guard shack on Over Road.”</p>
   <p>Rich took that as a sign that things weren’t totally secure in Pierce Point. He wondered how many others had internal guard stations. That would be Rich’s goal: make things so safe that people didn’t need their own guards. Everyone, or mostly everyone, was armed in their homes, so that would stop lots of crime.</p>
   <p>Rich could see that Ryan and the Team were fusing. He pulled Ryan aside and asked if Ryan wanted to work with the Team.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Ryan said. “They’re good guys. They don’t have my level of skills, but I don’t think they’ll get me killed.” Plus, Ryan really wanted to do the “door bustin’” work and it looked like the Team would be doing that, so he wanted to be with them. Guarding the gate bored him.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have an AR, do you?” Rich asked. “I haven’t seen you with one and I would imagine now is the time to carry one if you had one.”</p>
   <p>“Nope, no AR,” Ryan answered. He pointed to his pistol belt. “Got my Beretta, just like the one I had in the Corps.” Ryan had a 92F in 9mm.</p>
   <p>Rich motioned for Pow to come over. “Hey, Pow, what if Ryan worked with the Team?”</p>
   <p>“Sure.” Pow said. “Great idea.” Pow liked having a combat-experienced Marine along. Ryan would bring up their skill level and offer some great training. And he seemed like a good guy.</p>
   <p>“Sounds good to me,” said Ryan.</p>
   <p>“Ryan needs an AR. You got any extras?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep. Each of us has an extra AR or AK,” Pow said with a smile. “Which you like; AR or AK?”</p>
   <p>“AR,” Ryan said. “AKs are for the people who used to be trying to kill me. Kinda puts a bad taste in your mouth.”</p>
   <p>“OK, I have an AR for you,” Pow said. “I probably have some odds and ends to set you up with kit. I’ll hook you up when we get back to the yellow cabin at the end of the day.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks, man,” Ryan said.</p>
   <p>Rich pulled the Team, which now included Ryan, together and described how they would go down the road in front of the Grange and start meeting people in each house. Just to introduce themselves and let people know that they could call on them. Grant and Drew, once they got there, would come with them and take down information on each house. They’d find out how many people lived there, their names, any special needs, like medical conditions, whether they had a CB or other radio, and whether they had any equipment that might be useful to the community, like the mopeds. The Team would also ask if the homeowner had enough food, but wouldn’t pry and ask how much food they had.</p>
   <p>“Don’t push the equipment or especially food topics,” Rich said. “I don’t want to spook people into thinking that we’re getting a shopping list together for us to loot.” He was glad Grant would be along, because Grant seemed to be a master at this kind of person-to-person level of politics. And he was the brains behind the idea of using the lot numbers as a census and inventory.</p>
   <p>Rich noticed that “his” people like Dan were blending together easily with the Team into one working group. Rich was giving instructions to the Team, the Team had blended Ryan in, and Grant would be carrying out Rich’s plan, which was based on Grant’s idea about the lot numbers. They were working together seamlessly, after only a few days. Rich was so glad Grant and his friends had come to Pierce Point. They, in turn, were glad Rich was out here, too.</p>
   <p>Ryan went off with the Team and showed them some infantry moves. The Team had been introduced to these basic movements by Special Forces Ted, but had gotten rusty on them.</p>
   <p>The Team’s tactical training was more geared at SWAT things. In their training, which had been on a short-distance civilian gun range, bad guys were at short ranges; typically a room away or one house away. While most of the Team was oriented toward short-range SWAT purposes, Pow was an amazing sniper, and could provide long-range fire with his .308 bolt gun. Grant had no idea how he trained himself. Maybe he got some one-on-one training at a long-distance range from Special Forces Ted.</p>
   <p>Ryan’s military training was different than the Team’s. His was trained for bad guys being hundreds of yards out. He was also trained to have tools like grenades, machine guns, and even artillery and air support. They didn’t have any of that in Pierce Point, but between Ryan’s military training and the Team’s tactical law enforcement skills, they were a hell of a force. At least, against meth addicts and untrained gangs. Ryan knew what would happen if they went up against a real military unit.</p>
   <p>After about two hours of leisurely paced training, they heard the whine of mopeds. It was Grant and Drew. Chip hadn’t come; he had the day off after a night of guard duty and was sleeping.</p>
   <p>Rich used the CB to tell Grant to bring Drew and what they would be doing. Drew had never ridden a moped. Life during the Collapse was full of new experiences for everyone. Drew picked up quickly on moped riding but was a little scared, though he tried not to show it. He was the old accountant guy; he would be patrolling around with the Team today. He didn’t want to emphasize to the young guys that he was old and not exactly a gun fighter. He was honored to be asked out into the field with these guys. He “forgot” to tell Eileen that he would be patrolling with well-armed men. She would deal with it when she found out. Welcome to life after the Collapse. That meant your mild mannered accountant husband might be patrolling with an amateur SWAT team. This was the “new normal.”</p>
   <p>Rich was carrying out Grant’s idea for the lot number project and realized they needed a name for it. It would be a “census.” That sounded harmless and it reinforced the idea that Rich and the volunteers out there were…well, governing. “Governing” in the sense of solving community-wide problems with people who voluntarily wanted them to solve them; not the old kind of “government” which stole just about everything and bossed people around.</p>
   <p>A man on a bike rode up to the Grange. He was in his fifties with graying and thinning hair. He didn’t have a pistol, which looked a little weird.</p>
   <p>“Oh, hey, it’s Pete.” Rich yelled, “Over here, Pete,” and the man came over to them. Rich introduced everyone. “This is Pastor Pete,” Rich said. “He has agreed to do Mrs. Roth’s funeral.” They all shook hands.</p>
   <p>Rich and Pastor Pete talked about the funeral service at the Grange. Pastor Pete seemed a little apprehensive, not about using the Grange, but about doing the service. “I’m not really an ordained minister, or anything,” he told Rich. Pete had studied theology on his own. He knew a lot about it, but had no formal training.</p>
   <p>“That’s OK,” Rich said. “You’re our clergy out here.” This was another part of the “new normal” after the Collapse: people with no formal training were doing lots of jobs they technically weren’t qualified to do according to the pre-Collapse laws. But, most were doing a great job, despite the lack of credentials, which made everyone realize that pre-Collapse America required too many formal qualifications to do simple things. It made sense to have qualifications to do heart surgery—but to cut hair? The Collapse was the “do it yourself” era again in America. Like it had been up until the past fifty or sixty years.</p>
   <p>“Hey, you want to start church services here on Sundays?” Rich asked Pete. Rich hadn’t been to church in years, but with all that was going on, wanted to get back to it, as long as it wasn’t preachy church. He knew Pete wouldn’t be like that.</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete’s eyes lit up at the suggestion about him starting regular church services out there. “That would be great. Really great.” He paused. “This is what I’ve been waiting for; a chance to have a church.” He caught himself, “Not like I wanted all this to happen, of course.”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” said Rich.</p>
   <p>Grant and Drew arrived at the Grange on their borrowed mopeds.</p>
   <p>“A motorcycle gang of lawyers and accountants on mopeds,” Bobby said, pointing at Grant and Drew. “We can fight off bad asses like this.” Everyone laughed.</p>
   <p>Rich introduced Grant to Pete. Grant starting thinking about how nice it would be to have a church at Pierce Point. It would bring the community together even more. And, because Rich told Grant that Pastor Pete was not a “Bible thumper,” it was unlikely that the church services would divide people.</p>
   <p>Grant hated to admit what his next thought was: politics. Having church services would be good for the governance out there. People would meet—voluntarily—over something other than shifts for guard duty or taking turns cooking in the Grange kitchen. It would bring back a sense of normalcy out there. Actually, since most people in Pierce Point didn’t regularly attend church, it could be a new thing for many people; a community thing. Plus, Pastor Pete could perform functions that all societies needed: funerals, weddings, deathbed counseling, giving hope to those grieving after the loss of a loved one. This was important. Surviving wasn’t just about food and water. People needed a society to thrive.</p>
   <p>A truck drove up from the direction of the gate, which was a few miles down the main road. Dan got out of the cab and came over.</p>
   <p>He met Pastor Pete, who he recognized but didn’t really know. Dan said, “Oh, great. We have a chaplain. My guys and gals out at the gate—and soon to be on the beach patrol—could use a chaplain. They can’t get to church and…well, with what’s going on, they could use it. We all could. I know I can.”</p>
   <p>Dan added quickly, “Of course, it’s totally voluntary.”</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete said, “Oh, of course. It doesn’t work when you force things on people. I have some counseling training so I won’t approach everything from the religious standpoint if that’s not what people want. I’m just a guy people can talk to.”</p>
   <p>Perfect. Grant was determined not to let things needlessly start dividing people. There would be enough of that coming. Fights over food, work, everything. They didn’t need religion to be added to that. Or race, or anything else. They needed to get through this together.</p>
   <p>The Grange ladies started serving lunch. It was early for that, but Rich explained that they would be going out in the field to do the census so they had to eat now. They sat down to eat more good stuff; this time made by a different crew than the day before, but one that could cook just as well.</p>
   <p>While they were eating, Grant asked if anyone out there had a copy machine and paper. One of the ladies, Barbara, said her husband was a realtor and had a home office where he made fliers. He had a good sized copy machine and boxes of paper. Grant asked if he could talk to her husband sometime because he had a special use in mind for the copier.</p>
   <p>“I’ll have him come by tonight for the meeting,” Barbara said. “His name is Ken. Ken Dolphson.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Grant said. He had to find out Ken’s politics. If Ken was a Loyalist, he probably wouldn’t want to do what Grant had in mind for that copy machine.</p>
   <p>Lunch was over, and the Team headed out on foot to the houses nearest to the Grange. Drew rode along on a moped in case one of them needed to get back to the Grange in a hurry if the Team were called out to go do some SWAT work. He’d be the escort. Rich and Dan headed to the gate while Pastor Pete stayed behind and worked with the ladies on the funeral plans.</p>
   <p>Bobby asked Ryan if they should just walk down the road or be a little more “tactical” by thinking about cover. Grant was glad that Bobby asked Ryan, instead of him or Pow. It showed that the Team was looking to Ryan for leadership on questions like this. The Team was, after all, a group of civilians with no combat experience. Walking up on houses was more of an infantry exercise and something Ryan knew well.</p>
   <p>“Nah,” Ryan said, “just walk down the road. We have no reason to think people are trying to shoot us.” He added, “But I’m glad you’re thinking of these things.” Grant was glad Ryan answered this way because he didn’t want the residents to think the Team was sneaking up on them. They were a resource, not a threat.</p>
   <p>Houses seemed to be about a quarter mile apart. The Team wished they could just drive to all the houses, but gas was tight right now. Some of the residences had fairly long roads leading to a house or occasionally a mobile home and some were hidden in the woods.</p>
   <p>Ryan approached each house slowly, yet loudly. Many houses had barking dogs. Some dogs were loose, which was a problem for the Team.</p>
   <p>Ryan would do the knocking. Pierce Point residents might recognize him, but they certainly wouldn’t recognize the Team. Also, Ryan didn’t have an AR yet, which made him seem like less of a threat. The last thing they wanted was a friendly fire incident from a panicked homeowner.</p>
   <p>Once someone answered the door, Ryan would introduce himself and then the Team. They would chat with the homeowners. Pow, Bobby, and Scotty would casually look around for anything interesting. Grant told them to pay attention to any bumper stickers on cars because they could give clues about politics. Wes, the former equipment rental mechanic, was looking for equipment that might be useful. Drew and Grant would fill out information on clipboards.</p>
   <p>Most people were very glad to see them, especially the ones who hadn’t been to the meetings at the Grange as they hadn’t seen too many people in several days. They had been cooped up in their homes watching TV and worrying. The nice, well-armed young men knocking at the door represented law and order. Grant and Drew weren’t exactly young, but they added a sense of supervision to the Team. The Team regretted having eaten an early lunch because most people were asking them to come in and eat.</p>
   <p>Grant was doing his best to figure out people’s politics, but he wasn’t pushing it. The most he did was ask what people did for a living. If they were government employees, he would stop the political probing. There was a good chance they were Loyalists. It wasn’t a certainty that government employees were Loyalists, just a better chance. Grant felt weird obsessing about politics like he was—what kind of snoop comes onto a person’s property to look at their bumper stickers? But he knew that politics was important. Pierce Point would either be a divided group of people just getting by, or a Patriot stronghold. He was working hard to steer it in a definite direction.</p>
   <p>About half of the people volunteered to do anything they could to help. The other half just greeted them and gave out basic information. They weren’t very talkative, which was understandable considering that well-armed strangers were asking questions in a time when there were no police.</p>
   <p>A few people seemed like they might be problems in the future. One older lady was wildly incoherent, likely off of her medications. Finally, they had to leave her house because they couldn’t understand what she was saying. Something about her cats.</p>
   <p>One place was a definite red flag. It was a very rundown place, which wasn’t the problem because about a quarter of the places were rundown, and the people in them were usually perfectly fine. But this house had the lights on and it seemed like people were home. However, no one answered the door, even after repeated knocks from Ryan. Whoever was inside did not want to talk to them.</p>
   <p>“This is one to watch,” Grant said to Ryan, who nodded. Grant made a note of it in his records.</p>
   <p>Time flew by. It was 5:30 pm. They had to walk back about a mile and a half to the Grange. The meeting would be at 7:00 p.m. and Grant was hoping to meet the realtor with the copy machine.</p>
   <p>“Let’s head back,” he said. The guys were getting hungry despite all the snacks they were given by residents.</p>
   <p>Grant was holding up better than he thought for an old guy who had only a few hours of sleep. Once again, he thought about how important it was to be in shape. It was one of the most important preparations he made.</p>
   <p>The Grange and the tasty dinner inside seemed like heaven as the building came into view.</p>
   <p>Grant saw Lisa in the parking lot taking a break. She waved at him. It reminded Grant of when he would visit her at work when she worked in a real hospital.</p>
   <p>“What a day,” he said to the Team as they got to the parking lot. He felt great. This was what he was supposed to be doing. He loved these guys and his wife was out there now. They were the perfect people in exactly the right place.</p>

    <p><emphasis>No Government Needed</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant was tired, but his job wasn’t done. He wolfed down another fantastic home cooked farm dinner that consisted of steaks of some kind, probably deer, baked potatoes, and applesauce. Dang, these ladies could cook. What a lifesaver. Grant’s stored food at the cabin, as good as it was, wouldn’t last too long with all the guests he had. He realized, despite his best efforts, that mutual community support and growing food is the only way. Food storage is a vital necessity, but isn’t enough for a long-term situation.</p>
   <p>As he waited for the meeting to start, Grant could feel that the intensity was building up at each meeting. Each day, there were more and more political issues, like persuading the community to accept ideas such as the jail and judge. Grant could sense that each day, his opponents, guys like Snelling, were caucusing among themselves and coming up with reasons to oppose him and Rich and everyone else.</p>
   <p>Grant, who was normally a polite and diplomatic guy, knew that he needed to have an edge in these meetings. The residents were looking for a leader; a passionate and even forceful person to follow. However, “forceful” could be taken too far; the residents were rightly afraid of a dictator or a hothead taking over. Therefore, passion needed to be tempered with reason and logic, and even humor when possible. Sharp words, calmly spoken, were how to win this fight.</p>
   <p>And it was a fight. Pierce Point could easily become a jumbled homeowners’ association of weak and indecisive committees that couldn’t agree on having guards, and therefore, inadvertently, letting criminals walk right in. Grant imagined that was exactly what was occurring at his old neighborhood in Olympia, the Cedars.</p>
   <p>The Grange meetings were serious business. Politics—persuading people to do the right thing—could very easily be a matter of life and death. Politics can get whole communities killed just as easy as bullets. In fact, often the bullets kill a community because politics broke down. That was certainly true of the former United States, or “FUSA,” as everyone was starting to call it. People quit doing the right thing, and things broke down. The bullets flew. Pierce Point was a mini version of America. They would either do the right thing out there, which was following the Constitution and being decent to each other, or they would break down and the looters would walk in and slaughter everyone. Politics was serious business.</p>
   <p>People were filing into the meeting; mostly familiar faces, but some new ones. It seemed like more and more people were venturing out of their homes and finding rides to the Grange to see what was going on.</p>
   <p>This was good and a challenge at the same time. It was good that people were viewing the Grange meetings as the place where community decisions were made. It was a challenge because it meant more people with different viewpoints who needed to be persuaded. Not bossed around—that didn’t work—but persuaded. In a larger crowd, there would be more Loyalists. Oh well. That’s the job Grant had been given and he would do his best.</p>
   <p>The first order of business was Mrs. Roth’s funeral. Rich introduced Pastor Pete. They discussed the funeral and picked a date for it, which would be the next day at 10:00 a.m. Without embalming fluid, sooner was better than later. The group agreed to Pastor Pete’s idea for a cemetery. It would be the vacant lot overlooking the water. Grant silently wondered if it would be big enough. He imagined that there would be plenty more people dying soon, but he didn’t want to say that out loud. He suspected others were thinking the same thing, however.</p>
   <p>It was good that the community was working together on a governance issue like a cemetery. This was one of the first tests for the group, and it was going well. The next test that night would be the church services. Would that divide people?</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete asked if the community wanted regular church services. They did. Some asked what kind of church. Pastor Pete described it as non-denominational. “I know that we have people of many, many different denominations out there. There are plenty of things we all agree on. That’s what the services will be about. Anyone can talk to me at any time about this and I will make sure to listen. I want people at church, not to drive them away.”</p>
   <p>Dan described how Pastor Pete would also be the chaplain of the guards and beach patrol. Pastor Pete added that he would be happy to counsel people and would officiate at funerals and—he said with a smile—“hopefully weddings, too.” Many people in the crowd said they weren’t exactly “church people,” but were looking forward to attending on Sunday.</p>
   <p>Rich then motioned for Grant to come up. Rich whispered, “Should we tell them our idea for the jail and judge?”</p>
   <p>Grant whispered back, “Might as well.”</p>
   <p>Rich said to the audience, “OK, we have a proposal for you on a vital community matter. A jail and a judge. We have been very fortunate over the past few days to not have any crime, at least, that has been reported to us. That will change. While people protecting their homes and property is the main defense against crime, the guards and Team will likely be catching people, and the question is what to do with them.”</p>
   <p>“Shoot ‘em!” someone yelled out. Some people laughed.</p>
   <p>Rich didn’t laugh. “That’s not going to work for some things, like small thefts,” Rich said. “I don’t want to live in a place where a kid stealing a can of gas gets executed for it.” The crowd was quiet. The “shoot ‘em!” guy probably felt a little embarrassed.</p>
   <p>Rich continued, “But, on the other side of the spectrum, I don’t think we want all the bells and whistles of the current…I mean former legal system. It was pretty good at letting criminals go over and over again.” Rich let that sink in. He wanted there to be a little “shoot ‘em!” sentiment in the crowd, just not too much.</p>
   <p>“So,” Rich said, “we have a proposal to have a simple—simple—set of laws out here. Stealing small amounts, and we’ll define those and open it up for debate, would result in jail time. Probably a shorter jail time. Everyone in the community would know who the thief was, which is fine if it means a safer community. Stealing larger amounts would result in more jail time. People in jail would work, of course. We don’t want to give them an incentive to sit in jail and get free food. The community would need to feed them, so they’ll need to work for their meals.”</p>
   <p>“Feed them?” someone yelled out.</p>
   <p>Rich snapped back, “Yes. Feed them. We’re not animals. We need to come out of this with our humanity intact. If we start shooting each other over little things, we might as well be living in Frederickson or Olympia or, God forbid, Seattle. Anyone who wants that is free to go.”</p>
   <p>It was silent. Grant thought that only a respected former law enforcement officer like Rich could have the credibility with the crowd to say this. Grant thanked God that Rich was there.</p>
   <p>“Now, for serious crimes, like rape and murder,” Rich said, “well, we will shoot ‘em.” That got some applause from the crowd. “Maybe hang them. We can decide that. I’m leaning toward hanging. It makes much more of a statement than shooting.” More applause. Everyone in that meeting was afraid of rampant crime. They were afraid that the old way of preventing crime—formal police and courts—was over with. They craved a new solution to this problem.</p>
   <p>Rich motioned for Grant to come up to the front of the room. “Grant here, who was a lawyer,” it was funny to hear that in the past tense but it was true, “has some ideas on how to do all this. Don’t hate him because he was a lawyer,” Rich said with a smile. Rich wasn’t just cracking a joke; he was communicating something important: you may hate lawyers, but you need one now and this one isn’t a piece of crap like most are.</p>
   <p>Grant knew this was an important presentation. There was a lot at stake. He got up to the podium and started off, surprised by the wave of calm he felt in himself. He was strangely confident. He was going to nail this.</p>
   <p>“My basic plan,” Grant said, “is, one, simplicity, two, the Constitution—the real Constitution, not all the made up stuff they’ve come up with lately—and, three, transparency. Here’s what I mean,” he said pointing one finger up to show the number one.</p>
   <p>“Simple. The laws will be simple,” Grant said. “As in, theft of up to $100 in pre-Collapse value is second degree theft. Theft of more than $100 is first degree theft. Second degree theft is a week in jail. First degree theft is between a week and a year. I think we should have a jury decide the sentence. You all live here and it’s your system. You should decide. I’m just throwing out the week and year thing to give you a sense of what I mean by ‘simple’ laws. Every single person out here needs to know what price will be paid for a crime.”</p>
   <p>“Second,” Grant said, “the Constitution is how we run this. No unreasonable searches. In an emergency, of course, the constables…”</p>
   <p>Right then and there, Grant just picked the term “constables” out of thin air. He needed a term for “cops,” but one that didn’t have any negative connotations to it like “cops” had developed prior to the Collapse. “Constable” had an old English or New England feel to it. A civilized feel. The term implied a part-time, citizen police force. He’d run with it and see how people reacted.</p>
   <p>Grant continued, “The constables can run into a house if they’re trying to save a life or chasing someone. They can’t just barge into a house because they feel like it. If they do that, they’re not being constables, they’re being burglars and they should be shot like any other burglar.” That got some gasps from the crowd. Pow nodded. Grant wanted to emphasize that no one was above the law, not even him or the Team.</p>
   <p>“Other parts of the Constitution,” Grant said, “that should apply are a jury of your peers. That’s very important. We’re not going to be like the former government that would fine you $10,000 for cutting a tree on your property and then not let a jury of your peers—who probably thought that shouldn’t be a crime at all—determine if you should pay it. Like I said, I would like the jury to decide the sentences. I think it’s reassuring to know that if you are accused of something that a bunch of your neighbors will have the power to acquit you or lower your sentence.”</p>
   <p>“Also,” Grant said, “people are innocent until proven guilty. It makes prosecutions a little harder, but you know what? I don’t want to live in a place where I’m guilty until I prove myself innocent. That’s how the old system was, as a practical matter, and I didn’t like it much and I suspect you didn’t, either.” He was using this as a way to remind people how bad the old system was and implying that the Patriot system would be better. Because it would be.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Grant continued, “a person can only be convicted in a trial. A fair trial. No indefinite detentions. No military tribunals. None of that stuff. Trials will be open to the public, with a jury. Always.”</p>
   <p>“Also, a defendant gets to confront his or her accuser,” Grant said. “That’s in the Constitution, too.” Grant paused to let all this sink in. It meant that if someone wanted to accuse you of something that could result in you going to jail or getting hanged, he or she had to have the courage to look you in the eye. No anonymous “tips” that led to someone who didn’t like you getting you in jail or killed. Here, in Pierce Point, operating under the Constitution, the jury got to look at the body language of the accuser and see if he or she looked like they were falsely accusing someone.</p>
   <p>“A defendant will know the charges against him or her and will have time to prepare a defense,” Grant said. “He or she can have an attorney—although there are no other trained attorneys out here—or any other person to represent them. They can have time to prepare a defense, but they’ll probably be in jail the whole time awaiting trial so they have an incentive to hurry up. But, they can have all the time they need.”</p>
   <p>“They’ll have the right to speedy trials, too,” Grant said. “They can have a trial within a few days if they want. A truly innocent person would want that. We won’t let someone rot in jail for a year and then have trial. That’s just like a one-year jail sentence without a trial. You will remember that with all the budget cuts in the past, defendants weren’t getting speedy trials. That’s wrong and we won’t have it out here.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Besides, it won’t take us months to prepare for a trial,” Grant said. “We won’t have motions and technicalities. We’ll have simple. Memories of witnesses will be fresh soon after the crime. We’ll get on with it. No twenty-year death row appeals, either. If you’re guilty, and the jury says death, you’re gone.” That got some applause, although that was not Grant’s intention.</p>
   <p>“Evidence,” Grant said, introducing a new topic. “We’ll have simple evidence rules; the simple ones that worked just fine in this country for about 150 years until the lawyers,” some people laughed at Grant putting down lawyers, “started complicating everything. No hearsay unless one of the limited exceptions to hearsay applies. I don’t want third-hand stories, with no opportunity for cross examination to test the story, to be sending people to jail or getting them hung.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, that’s another thing,” Grant said. “Cross examination. That means the other side questioning a witness to see if there are holes in his or her story. A defendant or his or her representative can cross examine a witness. We’re not convicting people with just one side of the story coming out.”</p>
   <p>There was a pause. Rich asked Grant, “What do we do about the mentally ill?”</p>
   <p>Grant was glad Rich remembered that topic. “Well, there are some people who, in peacetime, had medications to keep them under control. They don’t have them now. Odds are that several people in Pierce Point are in that category. We can’t have people being a danger to themselves or others. I’m not sure we can treat them, not without all the medicines we took for granted in the past. So we’ll have to keep them confined if they’re a danger. We have a house picked out around here that should do the trick if it comes to that. We would lock it and guard it. If people got better, they would be released. We’d have medical people evaluating them. It would take a hearing and a jury to commit someone. They would need to be a serious danger to be confined. We take liberty very seriously, but we also take community safety seriously.”</p>
   <p>That about covered it. “Any questions?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Someone asked, “Do jurors get paid?” An odd question, but oh well.</p>
   <p>Grant thought. He remembered the old system where jurors got $10, lunch, and a parking pass. It was very hard to get people to serve on juries. Some of them lost hundreds of dollars a day by not being able to go to their jobs. Grant said, “Jurors can eat all day at the Grange.” That might not be a big deal now, he thought, but wait until winter when food is scarce. People will be clamoring to be on jury duty.</p>
   <p>Mark raised his hand with a smile, “Who will the judge be?” The crowd laughed.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Grant said modestly, “me if you’ll have me. I think I’m the only lawyer out here. The lack of lawyers here explains why things are running so smoothly.” More laughs. “Seriously, I will do it but I would need to be elected. And if I start to suck, you need to vote me out.”</p>
   <p>“Judge Matson!” someone yelled out. Grant couldn’t help smiling. He flashed back to college when he told Lisa’s parents that he was considering being a judge. Now it was coming true, just in a setting no one could have imagined then.</p>
   <p>“Where will the jail be?” someone asked.</p>
   <p>“Rich and I were thinking about the abandoned place near here,” Grant said. “Rich, what’s the name of it?”</p>
   <p>“The Schenk place,” Rich said. “She died a few years ago and it’s just going to pot. We’d have some guards there. The jail guards can be people who are not as able to do the gate guard duty, which involves more physical activity and probably more shooting.”</p>
   <p>“How many would the Schenk place hold?” the same guy asked.</p>
   <p>“Dunno,” said Rich. “If we fill it up, and I hope we don’t, then we’ll get another jail.”</p>
   <p>“What about a mental ward,” a woman asked. Grant remembered that incoherent older woman they saw that afternoon during the census. Grant and Rich hadn’t picked out a specific place for that.</p>
   <p>“We’re open to suggestions on a place for the mental ward,” Rich said. “It should be close to here,” he said, referring to the Grange, “so we don’t have to transport people far. An abandoned place is OK, as long as it is livable.”</p>
   <p>“Transparency is the next thing,” Grant said. “Everyone gets to see how everything is decided. Period. Pretty simple.”</p>
   <p>There was a pause. “Well,” Grant said, “no one wants to hear a lawyer talk all night so, if there aren’t any more questions, I’m done. How we do our justice system out here is for you to decide, as long as it follows the Constitution and is simple and transparent. I guess you could decide to have a system that didn’t follow that, but it wouldn’t involve me or my men.” That was the first time Grant had thrown down the term “my men” and the concept that the community would have to fight the Team if they went astray. It was the right time to hint at it. Grant wasn’t going to participate in a dictatorship or vigilante gang. The residents needed to know that. The short speech he gave about the Constitution and decency was the time to make that point.</p>
   <p>It was quiet for a while. Rich introduced the next topic.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said, “we have the Chief here to bring us up to speed on the beach patrol. Chief, take it away.”</p>
   <p>Chief Boswain’s Mate (retired) Shane Eaton came up to the front. He had on work clothes, not hunting clothes.</p>
   <p>The Chief went up to the podium and addressed the audience like he was giving a briefing to the captain of a ship. “We have twelve volunteers so far. All good men and women.” He introduced those of them who were at the meeting, which included Paul. It was good to see Paul had a solid role. Two, actually, because he was the metal fabricator for the gate and probably other projects, as well. It looked like Paul had lost some weight and was beaming with confidence. He looked happier than he had since Grant met him.</p>
   <p>“We’ll have one boat on the water at all times,” the Chief said, “including at night when it’s a little trickier. We have plenty of boats made available to us. I’ve been told to get with Drew and make sure those donations are recorded,” the Chief said as he was scanning the crowd for Drew. He saw Drew, they waved to each other, and the Chief kept going.</p>
   <p>“We will always have two in the boat for safety. We’ll cruise the water and into the open waters of the Puget Sound a little. We’ll try to conserve gas by drifting whenever possible. We’re there to detect any unauthorized craft, to board them if necessary, and to act as a deterrent. As far as authorized craft go, we are asking residents to stay off the water unless they absolutely have to be out on it. Try to get in touch with the Grange here and they can radio us that someone from here is on the water. I understand that there will be fishing and crabbing going on. We’ll work on a system of identifying friendlies. Speaking of fishing, we think that one of the reasons outsiders might encroach on our waters is to fish and get crab, clams, and oysters. We’ll tell them to leave and make an impression on them to not come back,” he said with a smile.</p>
   <p>“In addition to the two on a boat,” the Chief said, “we’ll have at least one man with a radio walking the beach roughly parallel to the boat. The beach walkers will be looking for any unauthorized people who have come ashore. They will also be a deterrent. The beach walkers will be well armed and they will need to know how to walk up on someone undetected. So far, my beach walkers have regular hunting rifles. I’d like to upgrade if possible, but I understand that AR-15s are in short supply right now. I can use people for this who don’t know boats. So if you’re a hunter or, better yet, ex-military, I’d love to have you as a beach walker.” Grant noticed that this was the first request for better armament he’d heard. He thought about that basement full of ARs and how much they’d be appreciated. But they were Chip’s, so it was up to him on how, or if, to use them.</p>
   <p>“I can’t pay you, of course,” the Chief said, “but my wife is arranging to have meals for the beach patrol. My neighbors down on the point are pooling their resources to do that.” The Chief waved at Drew again so Drew would know to get that recorded. “Our neighbors have plenty of deer meat and we’ll be fishing while we’re patrolling on the water. Get used to lots of fish, crab, clams, and oysters if you’re on the beach patrol. If you’d like to volunteer, see me after the meeting. Remember, no boating experience is necessary for the beach walkers.”</p>
   <p>Rich asked the Chief, “How you doin’ on gas?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, pretty good for now,” the Chief said. “We’re taking the gas out of our cars and trucks. We have nowhere to drive now. That will last us for quite a while. We’ll keep an eye on it and let you know.” More for Drew’s record keeping. Grant thought that Drew would need a helper or two and that gave him a political idea.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “You saw the Chief motioning to Drew about keeping a list of who’s contributing what. There will be a flood of that. I bet Drew could use some help. I also think it’s important for there to be transparency on this. I want everyone to know the records are being kept fairly. So anyone and everyone can help Drew keep records or inspect them at any time. We don’t have any secrets out here.”</p>
   <p>Drew gave the thumbs up. Grant asked, “Drew, could you use some help?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yes,” he said.</p>
   <p>“If you’d like to help with recordkeeping, go see Drew after the meeting,” Grant said. Some people nodded and smiled at this. It was important that people didn’t think Grant and his relatives were running everything. Grant tried to always think about how the former government did things—secrecy, favoritism, stealing, thuggery—and do the exact opposite.</p>
   <p>Rich could tell that the people, especially those standing, were getting a little tired. They’d been at this a long time.</p>
   <p>“How about we take a little break and start up in ten minutes,” he suggested. Everyone seemed to appreciate that. Besides, the socializing that people were doing at these meetings was as important as the “business” at hand. People were meeting up and sharing resources voluntarily. No government needed. The more people did on their own, the less Rich and Grant had to worry about.</p>

    <p><emphasis>The Ayes Have It</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>During the break, people were talking about having their neighbors over for dinner, having beach parties, which were excuses to share food, and talking about siphoning gas from their own cars for someone else to use. They were volunteering for the beach patrol and to help Drew with the recordkeeping. They didn’t need government telling them what to do; they were just doing what made sense.</p>
   <p>Not everyone was sharing, though. Some of the residents stood off by themselves and didn’t want to talk to people. They looked like they were taking everything in, but not willing to share any information. They were probably figuring out who had what and weren’t going to tell anyone about their stuff. Grant was trying to memorize the faces of all the people who were abstaining from the sharing. He had a hunch they’d be trouble in the future. Political trouble and, possibly, security trouble. He needed help keeping track of them. He motioned for Pow to come over and told him what was going on. Pow agreed to help memorize the “selfish” as he called them.</p>
   <p>Since this wasn’t socialism out there, people were free to be “selfish”—but only if they kept that selfishness to themselves. That is, if people wanted to be self-sufficient and not share, but didn’t ask for anything from others, that was fine. But Grant just knew they wouldn’t be that way. The people not sharing now would run out of whatever they had and then would demand that the community take care of them. That was the danger: the selfish demanding that someone else take care of them.</p>
   <p>The problems from the selfish would get even worse as supplies got thin. Grant had to manage this now by setting up a good framework, like the Constitution as the guide, and giving public praise to those who shared, like with Drew’s records. He would also manage it by showing the residents that the leaders, he and Rich and any others that emerged, were fair and decent—and had the practical solutions to their problems. He and Rich would need all the credibility possible to weather the storms and challenges threatening stability and order that would surely be coming. Now was the time to build up credibility and set the tone for the expectation that the community will voluntarily help each other.</p>
   <p>Rich called the meeting back to order. The first speaker was Dan.</p>
   <p>He started by introducing himself. “Many of you know me, but for those who don’t, I’m Dan Morgan. I’m retired Air Force Security Forces. I spent twenty-plus years guarding installations and providing base defenses. I’m a dog handler. I’m running the gate. Here’s what’s going on there.”</p>
   <p>“We have thirty-five guards,” Dan continued. “I’d say we have plenty, but we could use more. We can cover the gate 24/7 with enough men and women, but this is the minimum number I feel comfortable with. We can deter typical criminals, but my guys couldn’t repel an organized, let alone, professional, group of raiders. So I’m taking volunteers. We’ll feed you. I want to thank the Tuckers, Zimbalists, Mendozas, and…did I forget anyone? Thanks to all the people who are getting meals to my people at the gate. Protecting people is a lot easier with a full stomach.”</p>
   <p>“We have two categories of assets in addition to our guys at the gate,” Dan said. “We have some snipers who cover the gate. Not gonna say how many or where they are, but they can take out individuals who might get past the guards. They can neutralize a handful of bad guys.” Some of the crowd, most notably Snelling and his group of yuppies, winced at the word “neutralize.”</p>
   <p>“Another asset is my dogs,” Dan said. “I’m a K9 handler and have three attack dogs at the gate. They detect people trying to come across the creek and, for bad people scoping out the gate, scare the piss out of them. I patrol with my dogs up and down the creek.” Dan called it a “creek”; others called it a “river.” It was somewhere in between in size.</p>
   <p>“I’m the only one,” Dan said, “who knows the dogs, so I’m limited to the hours that I can stay awake. I’m trying to get a couple of guys who the dogs get to know and can handle them.” Dan had an AK slung across his shoulder. He was a bad ass, in great shape, and looked like he’d been in a few fights—and loved every minute of them.</p>
   <p>“Well, that’s the update,” Dan continued. “Here’s my question for the group. What do we do about guests? We’ve been getting a fair number of people coming to the gate who claim they are coming to stay with residents here. We take down the information they have about who the resident is that they want to stay with, and then we try to get a hold of that person and see if the guests are wanted. So far, all of them have been. Relatives and friends from the Seattle area, mostly. Number one, if you are expecting approved guests, let my guys know. We’ll put your guests on a list. This will save us tons of time. Also, it’s not the most secure thing to have carloads of people waiting around for an hour or more while we have to guard them.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“But,” Dan said looking at Rich, “here’s the bigger question.” Those two had talked about this topic. Grant wished Dan had talked to him, too, but this was Rich’s show.</p>
   <p>“What do we do about guests?” Dan asked. “I mean, if your relatives are coming out here and need a safe place and you have one for them, who am I to tell them no? But, then again, if we start taking in everyone, how do we feed them? So, Rich and I are thinking that we have a rule that you can have guests as long as you are responsible for feeding them.”</p>
   <p>The crowd was nodding at that. Letting people in was the easy half of the equation, Grant thought. Keeping friends and relatives out would be the hard part.</p>
   <p>“We don’t know your guests,” Dan continued. “Sorry to say this, but what if your cousin is a gang banger? A meth head? A sex offender? I don’t want that shit in my base—I mean neighborhood. I know the odds are that any of your guests are not bad guys, but we need to know. We propose a simple ‘immigration’ process. We get to interview your guests. Again, 99% of the time, we can tell people are fine pretty much instantly. But if your cousin from Seattle comes here and has neck tattoos, that means a little extra scrutiny. In a case like that, we would have the right to turn them away.”</p>
   <p>The crowd murmured. They didn’t like that.</p>
   <p>“If we’re responsible for them, why do you care if they have a tattoo?” someone asked.</p>
   <p>“Not all tattoos,” Dan said and showed his forearm, which had plenty of them like lots of military guys had. “But a neck tattoo tells me something. Bad.”</p>
   <p>“So, you get to approve who comes in?” someone else asked.</p>
   <p>“No, not me personally,” Dan was getting a little upset. He was trying to keep them safe and they were being difficult.</p>
   <p>“I’m just the guy,” Dan said, “patrolling your gate eighteen hours a day with my dog team.” Point well made. “No, an ‘immigration committee’ would make the call after the guards flag someone—in some extreme situation like a neck tattoo with gang symbols—and then we’d bring the matter to the full group.”</p>
   <p>“So, my neighbors get to decide if my family can come out here?” the first person asked.</p>
   <p>“Well, if they have a neck tattoo with gang symbols, yes.” Dan said calmly.</p>
   <p>“I’m opposed to that,” the first person said. She must have family coming that looked a little questionable.</p>
   <p>Grant, the politician, stepped in. “Let’s see if this neck tattoo thing is even a problem,” he said. “If we have no one we need to question, then there’s no problem. But I think we should have an ‘immigration’ person to interview people and coordinate the list of approved guests. I want to take some of the administrative tasks off the guards’ plate so they can guard with their full attention to the threats that are out there.”</p>
   <p>That seemed pretty reasonable, so the protests stopped. A man raised his hand, “I can be the immigrations guy. I was a Border Patrol agent thirty years ago. I forgot lots of things, but I’m a pretty good judge of people.”</p>
   <p>Dan said, “Great. What’s your name?”</p>
   <p>“Albert VanDorn,” the man said. “Call me Al.”</p>
   <p>“Great, Al,” Dan said. “Get with me after the meeting and we’ll get you started. We could use a second immigrations guy for the night shift, too.” Two more people raised their hands. “Of course, the immigrations people will also be guards and will need to be armed. Are you OK with that?” Dan asked Al and the two volunteers, who all nodded in agreement.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t want to raise the point now, because it would terrify people, but they would need medical people on the immigrations team for when diseases were spreading. A few weeks after a collapse, communicable diseases that weren’t a problem in peacetime, like the flu, would spread like wildfire without medical treatment and in bodies weakened by malnutrition and stress. That was too dark a thing to bring up now, but it underscored the fact that an immigrations process of some kind was necessary.</p>
   <p>Grant was glad he had read survival novels like <emphasis>Lights Out</emphasis>, <emphasis>One Second After</emphasis>, and <emphasis>Patriots</emphasis>. There was a lot to learn in them, even if they were “fiction.” One of the things the surviving groups in all three books did was allow people with valuable skills to come into their communities. They had a way of screening people to find the ones that could add to the community. Grant realized that this would be a mission for the immigration committee. He thought this was the time to bring it up.</p>
   <p>“Another thing the immigrations people can do is screen people wanting to join us,” Grant said. “Let’s say someone is a doctor, an expert at treating water, or a communications expert with lots of valuable gear.” Grant didn’t say the real group he was thinking about, which was intact military units that wanted to fight for the Patriots. He didn’t want to scare people. Not this early. “Whatever the skills or gear, let’s say we really need him or her and they want to stay with us. The immigrations people can screen them and flag them for an interview by us. What do you think?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, but where would the strangers stay?” someone asked.</p>
   <p>“Abandoned houses and cabins,” Grant said. “There are quite a few here. The real owners would have dibs if they came back. The occupants would improve the places while they’re there and would pay rent to any returning owner.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>The Constitution. Just like the Constitution.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Grant realized this was an opportunity about how they should follow the Constitution even on things that didn’t seem like “legal” matters.</p>
   <p>“It’s like the Third Amendment,” Grant explained, “that forgotten clause of the Constitution. You know the one about not being forced to quarter troops.” It made an exception for a time of war, and this was definitely as close to a war as they could have. But the principle was the same: people would not be forced to house government employees. The crowd was nodding. This was Grant’s segue to a speech he’d been wondering when to give. Now was a good time.</p>
   <p>“This brings up a good point,” he said. “I think we should follow the Constitution out here for everything, not just our law enforcement and homemade court system. But let’s go further. Let’s have it for everything else.” Do the opposite of what the former government did, Grant thought. Here goes.</p>
   <p>“Let’s start with the First Amendment,” Grant said. “Out here, I suggest, no one can be punished for saying anything. Call me a ‘teabagger’ if you want. Whatever. I’ll still run into your house if a looter is trying to kill you. The other parts of the First Amendment would also apply here. Freedom of religion, which includes the freedom to be free from religion. Petition government for redress of grievance, too. You can always talk freely to us, publicly or in private. We would be transparent. This should be like a New England town hall.”</p>
   <p>“The Second Amendment,” Grant said, pointing to the AR slung across his chest. “’Nuff said. I don’t think anyone—with all the threats out here and especially outside the gate—wants to be disarmed.” Todd Snelling glared at Grant, but he could care less.</p>
   <p>“The Third Amendment we covered,” Grant said. “The Fourth too, when we talked about no random or intrusive searches without a warrant. The Fifth is a big deal. Not only the part about not having to testify against yourself, but the due process and property clauses. Due process means we won’t take your life, liberty, or property without some legal process of some kind. It could be review by a judge and a jury. You may not agree with the decision, but it won’t be a band of thugs doing whatever they please.” Grant couldn’t resist, “That was the former government and we’re doing things better out here now that we have the chance.”</p>
   <p>That got a few people clapping. Just a few, though.</p>
   <p>“The property clause would apply to what we do at the Grange,” Grant said. “That says that we can’t take your property except for a public purpose and we must pay you fair market value for it. This will prevent the community from stealing people’s food or other property. This is critical and I, and my Team, will not live in a place where this isn’t the case.” Grant had no idea if the Team agreed with him on a legal point like this. Once again, by describing the Team as “his,” Grant was not-so-subtly reminding people that he was in control of them. That wasn’t really true; the Team wasn’t “controlled” by anyone except themselves.</p>
   <p>“The Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Amendments are a criminal law thing and were already discussed,” Grant said, realizing that people weren’t sitting in this meeting to get a long lecture on the Constitution. They wanted to see how this Grant guy and that Constitution thingy related to their daily lives during this scary time. “The Ninth and Tenth Amendments related to the states versus the federal government, which we no longer need to worry about.”</p>
   <p>That was a controversial thing to say, Grant knew, because some people in the audience still believed the United States existed. It did, on paper and maybe in practice in some places like the East Coast or California. But Grant was mentally preparing the people listening to him to conclude that they were on their own out there and the only government they had—or needed—was right there in the Grange that night.</p>
   <p>“Finally, I think we need to vote on things,” Grant said. “We will need to vote to give authority to people to do things, like the immigrations people need the authority to screen people. We can’t all meet down at the gate to individually interview a dozen people a day. That kind of thing. We wouldn’t give people powers without electing them, starting with me. Like I said, if I suck, remove me. We need to elect a Sheriff and I think that should be Rich.” Lots of nodding.</p>
   <p>“Oh, and I think we should have a civil justice system,” Grant said, realizing that he needed to wrap up this legal stuff. People were there to hear about guard duty, but he had their attention and this was an important topic. “By ‘civil justice system,’” Grant said, “all I mean is a way of peacefully resolving the inevitable disputes that will arise. Your dog ate my chicken, that kind of thing. But nothing complicated and,” Grant smiled, “other than the judge, no damned lawyers.” That got a couple of laughs.</p>
   <p>Grant paused, got very serious, and said in a very resolute voice, “We’re going to start over out here and do things right. This is our chance to set up simple rules that everyone can live with. Unlike the old system.”</p>
   <p>The crowd was silent, taking it all in.</p>
   <p>Then the clapping started. Lots of people yelled, “hell, yeah!” and “right on!” A sizable portion, about a quarter, of the crowd was not as enthused. Some sat there stone-faced, others just clapped politely. Grant was paying close attention to who they were. Not to retaliate, but to intensify the persuasion efforts on those people. They were undoubtedly afraid that Grant was too much of a leader and was promising too much. That was fair. The old government had taken way too much power and promised so much—and then failed miserably—that people were entitled to be skeptical of someone with a rifle saying they’d follow the Constitution.</p>
   <p>When the cheering died down, John yelled out, “Let’s take a vote on following the Constitution!”</p>
   <p>More cheering.</p>
   <p>John asked, “All in favor?” and almost all hands went up. John spoke in an exaggerated and comical formal voice, “The ayes have it. Pierce Point will follow the Constitution.”</p>
   <p>Now, Grant thought, we have to actually do it; that’s the hard part. Wait until someone acts like a jackass and the Constitution protects him. That’s when the real leadership kicks in. These people had no experience actually living under a constitutional system. Oh, they were told in high school about the Bill of Rights. Then the rest of their lives they were taught that the government had to put “reasonable” restraints on all these rights. Free speech? Sure, as long as it didn’t offend anyone. So these people had never experienced reacting to offensive speech by letting the speaker continue to be offensive. They had seen the authorities take care of the problem; they never had to deal with the problem themselves. Now they would.</p>
   <p>Grant remembered how hard it was for people in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to operate under freedom. Freedom is hard, although most think it is easy. It used to be natural to Americans, but that was over a hundred years ago. When people become used to looking to government instead of themselves for everything, freedom is scary. It is like when an inmate is released from prison after thirty years. He is used to dinner at exactly 5:30 p.m. When he’s out of prison and 5:30 p.m. rolls around, he gets nervous because dinner isn’t there. Sometimes the stress of freedom leads former inmates to want to go back to prison for the comfort it provides. The comfort of not having to make any decisions or rely on themselves. The comfort of the FUSA.</p>

    <p><emphasis>This is All Illegal</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>During the meeting that night at the Grange, Grant had been noticing Todd Snelling and his snarky facial expressions and little whispers to his group of apparent supporters. They included his wife, Dick Abbott, the retired LA cop, and three other “cabin people.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>Be bold.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Grant knew what the outside thought was talking about so he went with it.</p>
   <p>“So, Todd,” Grant said, pointing to the architect, “what do you think of all this?” Grant was putting his opponent on the spot. It was always best to be on the offense and then to de-escalate and look reasonable.</p>
   <p>“I think this place is a little militia dictatorship, with a bunch of testosterone fueling your hair triggers,” Snelling said with a sneer. That metrosexual sneer might have been a big hit in a Seattle conference room, but not out here in a Grange hall. Snelling’s supporters nodded slowly, like they were afraid of fully backing him. They were scared. Good, Grant thought. They ought to be.</p>
   <p>Snelling had a backpack slung over one shoulder. He took it off quickly and angrily—and started to open it. It looked like he was pulling out a gun.</p>
   <p>Everyone on the Team watched closely. They wouldn’t call “Threat!”—and draw their weapons—unless they saw an actual weapon. They didn’t want to overreact. Pulling guns on a guy in a crowded room full of innocents is to be avoided. Besides, politically, Grant didn’t want the “macho” Team to draw weapons and scare everyone if Snelling was just getting out a pen.</p>
   <p>Snelling got out a piece of paper. He started to look at it until Grant rudely interrupted his train of thought.</p>
   <p>“Did you just get shot, Mr. Snelling?” Grant calmly asked.</p>
   <p>“No,” Snelling said indignantly. “That’s preposterous.” He rolled his eyes. Another effective tactic in a Seattle conference room, but not so much in the Grange with armed men.</p>
   <p>“Yes, it would be preposterous,” Grant said. Everyone was wondering where Grant was going with this seemingly ridiculous question about whether Snelling had been shot.</p>
   <p>“No, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said, “you did not get shot. You were concerned that the Team was on a ‘hair trigger,’ a testosterone fueled one, if I recall correctly.”</p>
   <p>With his hands up in the air, and away from his pistol, Grant made a trigger motion with his finger as if he were instructing a class. “Mr. Snelling, a ‘hair trigger’ means shooting too fast. These men—‘macho’ men as you call them—are very well trained and only shoot when they see a weapon. They did not see one and you did not get shot. That, sir, is the opposite of a hair trigger.” Grant was in his element. He was going to destroy this little Snelling shit. With words and body language.</p>
   <p>Snelling couldn’t speak. He had frozen. No one had ever talked to him that way. He had always been in control of a conference room or cocktail party. This Grange thing was different.</p>
   <p>After a few moments of the crowd seeing Snelling’s weakness, Grant decided it was time to make a vivid point. He said, “Wes, come here, please.”</p>
   <p>Wes came over and Grant handed him his rifle, after checking to make sure the safety was on, which it was.</p>
   <p>“Bobby?” Grant motioned for him to come over. Grant drew his pistol and, keeping it pointed in a safe direction, handed it to Bobby.</p>
   <p>The crowd was spellbound. Was Grant going to shoot Snelling right here in front of everyone? The crowd had no idea what Grant was doing, but they knew it was dramatic.</p>
   <p>Grant stared right at Snelling and said, “I’m unarmed now. Nothing to fear from those evil guns, Mr. Snelling. Now, let’s talk man to man. No guns. No violence. Just logic. Are you willing to discuss logic, Mr. Snelling?”</p>
   <p>Snelling seemed to have no idea what to say. He muttered, “OK.”</p>
   <p>Grant needed to pre-empt Snelling on the POI topic. By now, everyone in Pierce Point probably had heard the rumor that he was on the POI list.</p>
   <p>“First of all, the POI thing,” Grant said very calmly, like he was talking to an old friend instead of an enemy. “Tens of thousands of people are on that list, sir. Maybe even some in this room, for all I know. It is not a ‘wanted’ list for any alleged crimes. As the name implies, Mr. Snelling, it is a list of ‘persons of interest.’ Surely you recognize that that is different than a wanted list. Do you have any evidence that I have committed a crime?”</p>
   <p>Snelling just stared. He had nothing to say. He had never been in a debate like this. Never.</p>
   <p>Grant paused. It was time to move in for the kill.</p>
   <p>“Todd,” Grant said like Snelling was his best friend, “you have been handed an amazing gift. A democracy where we follow the Constitution. Elections, transparency, the Bill of Rights. Well-trained constables and guards to protect you. There are men and women right now, as we speak, at that gate willing to get shot by hordes of looters just so you can have this debate with me. Do you know what it’s like to risk your life for others, Mr. Snelling? Do you know what it’s like to risk your life for people who hate you and don’t appreciate what you’re doing for them, Mr. Snelling?”</p>
   <p>Snelling was in shock. He couldn’t speak.</p>
   <p>Grant knew that he had de-escalated with words and now it was time to de-escalate with body language. He relaxed and let his posture slump a little. He sat down on the table at the front of the room and put his hands on it like he was taking a break. Grant smiled. He just sat there, as comfortable and happy as can be. He let that sink in a while.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Snelling, do you appreciate all you have been given out here?” Grant asked in his most sincere, but not patronizing, voice. “Do you, sir?”</p>
   <p>Snelling was still silent. He could feel that he was losing this showdown. Losing badly.</p>
   <p>Finally, Snelling said, “I appreciate not living where a small band of armed men run everything. That’s what I appreciate.”</p>
   <p>Grant smiled. More de-escalation. “Fair enough. Fair enough. But I question the premise of your point on two grounds.”</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for Bobby to bring Grant’s pistol back, and while he was doing that, Grant said, “First of all, we’re not running things. Everyone gets to vote. Not just every four years, but anytime. Would you like to vote on removing me as the judge right now? I would even second the motion to allow the vote to happen.”</p>
   <p>Grant safely took his pistol back from Bobby and walked toward Snelling. He walked right up to him. Snelling flinched because he expected Grant to shoot him. Grant loved the visceral sign of absolute weakness that Snelling was showing the crowd by flinching as he approached.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “The second reason I question the premise of your statement that ‘armed men are running everything’ is that you can be armed.” Keeping the pistol pointed in a safe direction, Grant tried to hand the gun to Snelling.</p>
   <p>“Go ahead, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said. “Take it. You’ll be armed and I won’t. You’ll be the armed man. You or anyone else in this room can—and should—be armed. That would make it pretty hard for my five or six guys to rule over hundreds of you.”</p>
   <p>Snelling was visibly terrified of holding the gun. Grant smiled.</p>
   <p>Grant made exaggerated motions of handing the gun again to Snelling, who refused. Finally, Grant shrugged and safely holstered his pistol.</p>
   <p>The crowd started laughing. They could tell that Grant was screwing with this guy. And winning.</p>
   <p>Snelling was done. He’d had enough. He expected to accuse Grant and Rich and the whole militaristic cabal of being macho Hitlers and have them react with aggression, which would have made his point for him. He did not expect what Grant had done. Grant had used logic instead of force, which was exactly the opposite of what Snelling expected.</p>
   <p>Snelling picked up his backpack and started to leave. His wife followed him, but his little cheering section stayed. They didn’t want to be seen with him. However, after several angry hand motions from Snelling, they followed. Except Dick Abbott who stayed behind, looking pissed.</p>
   <p>Grant asked, calmly and with a smile, “Any more questions?”</p>
   <p>Abbott said angrily, “Yeah. I got one. How is any of what you’re doing legal? There’s a real court system and regular police. This little Grange court and your homemade police force is illegal.”</p>
   <p>Time to take this clown, too, Grant thought. He looked right at Abbott and asked, “Illegal by what set of laws?”</p>
   <p>“The laws of the state of Washington and the United States,” Abbott answered in a “no duh” tone.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to talk about the “FUSA,” but that would be too much for the crowd, at least at this point. “Legality is very important, Mr. Abbott. Isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>Abbott nodded.</p>
   <p>“Like paying your taxes,” Grant said. “How many people in this room paid every penny of their taxes the past couple of years?” No one raised their hands.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Dan,” Grant said to Dan Morgan, “How are those retirement checks you should be getting from the Air Force? Those coming on time?”</p>
   <p>Dan shook his head and laughed.</p>
   <p>“Hey, everyone,” Grant said with a smile, “how is that free government health care? It’s against the ‘law’ to deny you all the health care you want. Do you have to bribe receptionists to see a doctor? Why, that’s ‘illegal,’ isn’t it? Is it legal for the government to order the grocery store to limit people to $200 of purchases?” Grant was on a roll.</p>
   <p>“The President’s ‘emergency powers’?” Grant said. “The Governor seizing gas stations? You want me to stop now, Mr. Abbott? I’ll bet you do.” Grant was grinning. He was in his element. Maybe too much. It was a rush to destroy these shit heads.</p>
   <p>“This is…treason,” Abbott said. “That’s what it is, setting up your own little fiefdom out here.” Abbott was getting desperate.</p>
   <p>The crowd was silent.</p>
   <p>“Treason?” Grant asked with a smile. “Did you say ‘treason’ Mr. Abbott?” The crowd expected Grant to draw a pistol on this guy. Instead, Grant held his hands out as if to say, “Please elaborate.”</p>
   <p>Abbott stormed out.</p>
   <p>Grant sat down. That was about all that needed to be done. Grant was done with Abbott and Snelling. But he knew they weren’t done with him.</p>

    <p><emphasis>The Pierce Point Patriot</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The meeting broke up. Many people wanted to talk to Grant and thank him for shutting down Snelling and Abbott. Not all were thanking him, though. Some looked at him like he was a threat, like they were trying to figure out how he was going to screw them. That was fair. Politicians had been doing that regularly for several decades. And now here was a guy talking about following the Constitution; a guy with a scary rifle and a pistol. A little scrutiny was warranted.</p>
   <p>There was one last guy who wanted to talk to Grant. He waited around for a while until everyone else was done and then came up and said, “Hi, Mr. Matson, I’m Ken Dolphson. My wife, Barbara, said you needed a copy machine.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Oh, great, Ken,” Grant said as they shook hands. “I think your copy machine can help perform an important service for the community out here.”</p>
   <p>“What would that be?” Ken asked.</p>
   <p>“A newspaper,” Grant said. “A one-page, double-sided piece with community news. Things like an obituary for Mrs. Roth. Updates on how people can help or be helped. Maybe letters to the editor. That kind of thing. Would you like to donate the use of your copier for that?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sure,” Ken said. “I had never thought of having a paper out here. Yeah, that would be great.”</p>

   <p>“How much paper do you have out here?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh,” Ken said, thinking about how much he had, “I got several reams for all the flyers I do for my listings. I got a whole pallet of paper delivered out here a few years ago and have almost all of it. Sales of real estate are down a bit right now,” Ken said with a smile. “Can you design the paper? You know, headlines and that kind of thing?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“I guess,” Ken said. He’d never put together a newspaper, but had done lots of fliers. Ken realized that, in the Collapse, people were doing lots of jobs they never expected to. “No problem,” he said. “Do I have to go get the stories?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Grant said, “but you can if you want to. Anyone can publish a story. I have plenty of story ideas, like that obituary I mentioned. Mary Anne Morrell can write it; she had been taking care of Mrs. Roth.”</p>
   <p>“What’s the paper going to be called?” Ken asked.</p>
   <p>“The <emphasis>Pierce Point Patriot</emphasis>,” Grant said. The name jumped right out at him. The <emphasis>Patriot</emphasis>. That’s right. It would be a source of local news and non-political information that people could use. And they could trust it—unlike the news on TV and the internet. There wouldn’t be much, if any, overt political opinion. There wouldn’t need to be. If the <emphasis>Patriot</emphasis> told people where to get AA batteries and who was having a canning party to put up the season’s apple crop into applesauce, it wouldn’t need to have an editorial about the Founding Fathers or why the former government was a failure. It would be pretty obvious: the former government was a failure because they couldn’t provide anyone with AA batteries or apple sauce. The Patriots were providing those things. The Patriots were solving the problems that the former government created. That’s the kind of politics that people would gravitate toward: solving their problems, fairly and without force. So, one of Grant’s most political ideas, the newspaper, would not show any signs of being political.</p>
   <p>“All I ask,” Grant said to Ken, “is that the name of the paper be the ‘<emphasis>Pierce Point Patriot</emphasis>’ and the logo be the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ flag. Would that be OK, Mr. Publisher?”</p>
   <p>Ken laughed at being called the publisher. “Sure,” he said. Ken had been sick of how things had been going for some time. The things the Feds did to the housing market were unbelievable. Ken hadn’t said anything; it was bad for business to be “political” especially if that meant pissing off the government people who held the approvals his business needed in their hands. He didn’t think there was anything he could do except try to eek out a living and pay his taxes. But, Ken had decided quite a while ago that the country needed a “restart.” So now he was the publisher of a Patriot newspaper. Fine with him.</p>
   <p>Ken paused. He couldn’t help it, “Can I put in a little ad about my services? I will do property sales—with our own property title records system I guess we’ll have out at the Grange here—in exchange for some barter. Would that be OK?” Another use for the lot numbers: records of property sales.</p>
   <p>“Of course, Ken,” Grant said. “Our side is all about free enterprise and small business. You are donating the copy machine and the paper. You’re entitled to a little advertising.” Then it hit Grant. This was the first sign of economic activity he’d seen out there. Donating deer meat to guys on guard duty didn’t count. But ads for realtors and buying and selling property did. For a brief moment, Grant thought that a recovery would be possible. This is how it would start: small and without government. People doing what they always have done: buying and selling things. The rebuilding is already showing signs of beginning, Grant thought.</p>
   <p>It was late and Grant was tired. Really tired. He would try to sleep in tomorrow. He said good night to Ken and Rich and found out the Team had already gone back in Mark’s truck. Grant got on the moped and rode home on another beautiful May evening.</p>
   <p>It was warm out, even after dark. The stars were out. In the middle of all this man-made mess and misery was beauty. Nature’s beauty.</p>
   <p>Grant couldn’t turn his mind off. Today he had gone on patrol and conducted a census, outlined a criminal justice system, a Constitutional governance system, and a civil courts system. He had been elected as judge, kind of; there hadn’t been a vote, really. He had thought on his feet, tried to hand his pistol to a hostile man, and verbally demolished an opponent. Oh, and started a newspaper. Not a bad day’s work.</p>

    <p>Chapter 115</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Four Categories</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 11)</p>
   </title>
   <p>With his mind racing during the moped ride home, Grant thought about Ken and the newspaper. He thought about how Ken had watched the government destroy his livelihood and how he had thought he couldn’t say anything—let alone do anything—about it. About how Ken wanted a “reset.” Ken was like a lot of Americans.</p>
   <p>The population, Grant realized, was divided into four groups: Patriots, Loyalists, the Undecideds, and the Oblivious.</p>
   <p>It varied by region. The more rural the area, the more Patriots; the more urban, the more Loyalists. The more Southern and Western (except the cities on the West Coast), the more Patriots. The more Northeast, the more Loyalist.</p>
   <p>As Grant had seen with his own eyes, the Patriots were furious at what was happening. They weren’t revolutionaries—at least not this early into the Collapse—but, instead saw withdrawing from the former government as self-defense. They were taking actions to protect themselves from a government that had gone from serving them to abusing them.</p>
   <p>Pierce Point was a perfect example. They were setting up their own little system to take care of themselves and having armed guards and a gate. They weren’t trying to take on the United States military. They were just doing what they had to do, which happened to mean not recognizing the authority of the federal government. This wasn’t some grand political philosophy; people didn’t sit around talking about revolution, Thomas Jefferson, or any of that. They didn’t sign a document saying they were declaring their independence from the United States. They didn’t care and didn’t have the time for luxuries like heavy political thoughts; they had to do guard duty and get their kids some food. They still called themselves “Americans” and would say the country they lived in was the United States. They just didn’t have any use for the United States government, or what little of it was left.</p>
   <p>From years of being one of the only people who thought like he did, Grant realized that the Patriots were the minority; only a few percentage points of the population. Grant estimated that the Patriots he knew in Olympia were only a few percent of the population. But, then again, in the Revolutionary War, only about five percent of the population were Patriots at first and look at how that turned out.</p>
   <p>The Loyalists, who made up ten to fifteen percent of the population, were the ones who depended on government and knew that if it fell, they would be out of a job—or worse. Being dependent on government didn’t guarantee that a person would be a Loyalist. The majority of the population was dependent on the government in one way or another, but some of the dependent ones were on the fence or didn’t care. Some of the dependent ones were even Patriots. There were no neat and clean lines.</p>
   <p>Most Loyalists did not spend their time thinking about politics. Indeed, as products of the public school system, most had no political knowledge; just feelings about how things should be.</p>
   <p>The essence of being a Loyalist was a belief that if the current government fell, then America would end. Loyalists were fighting to preserve what they had been taught that America was all about: fifty states and big federal government. A lot of what fueled Loyalists was fear of the Patriots. Patriots had become pegged as racist, Southern, gun-loving haters. A “Bubba.” The Loyalists were actually afraid that if the Patriots took over that slavery would return and women would be barefoot and pregnant. The cartoon image of the Patriots got more and more exaggerated—but, repeated often enough, as it had been in the schools and media for decades, it became more and more powerful.</p>
   <p>Grant was thinking of the reactions he’d seen from many people in the Grange that night. They were on the fence. They were the third group, the Undecideds. They were probably sixty percent of the population, just like during the first Revolutionary War.</p>
   <p>The Undecideds were generally angry at what had happened, but were too weak to do anything about it. Weakness wasn’t necessarily cowardice. Some were just not in a position to fight effectively. They might quietly resist, or they might not resist at all. They would complain about the government, but either thought they couldn’t do anything or were terrified to think about opposing the government. All their lives, they had seen what happened to people who opposed the status quo: ridicule, job loss, sometimes even jail. They didn’t want to rock the boat. They didn’t respond to things like passionate speeches about liberty or the Constitution. They had no idea about those things because they were never taught them in the public schools.</p>
   <p>More importantly, most of the Undecideds didn’t care for politics and thought it was basically a game played with the people’s money. They were right about that, but thought they were powerless. They were muddling through.</p>
   <p>Most of the Undecideds were just plain weak. Timid. Pathetic. Deserving of what they got, Grant hated to say. They didn’t really deserve to be treated like the government was treating them, but it was so completely understandable why the government was doing it—because the government could. This was because the Undecideds were so afraid of their own shadow that they would just take what the government gave them, mutter under their breaths, and hope they got through the day.</p>
   <p>The Undecideds were the ones the Patriots needed to win over. Grant knew that this was how the first Patriots—the ones in the Revolutionary War—won. And it was how they would win the second one.</p>
   <p>George Washington had it right: feed and protect the Undecideds, gain their confidence because you are taking care of them and showing them you are fair and just and, most importantly, effective at making their lives better. Eventually they will be on your side. Maybe even if they don’t really want to be—they will just acknowledge that the Patriot way works better than the old way.</p>
   <p>The last of the four categories was the Oblivious. They made up about twenty to twenty-five percent of the population. They were so ignorant and dependent that all they cared about was what was on TV or when they’d get their next bag of Doritos. The younger ones were completely preoccupied with technological distractions, like cell phones and video games. Constant sex also kept their minds elsewhere. The middle-aged Oblivious were usually just working too hard to pay their taxes or were dependent leaches on the system. The older Oblivious just wanted to live out their golden years and have the government pay for it, just like they’d been promised.</p>
   <p>The Oblivious weren’t at the Grange meetings. They were too lazy to show up. They just figured that someone would take care of them. People had been doing that for their whole lives, so what would be different now? The Oblivious were largely hidden, but still made up a sizable portion of the population. They were the most dangerous. They would get hungry and desperate and lash out. Almost all of the criminals were the Oblivious. They caused big problems.</p>
   <p>Grant actually didn’t want the Oblivious on his side. All they did was consume. They were a drain on resources. (The disabled and elderly weren’t worthless Oblivious; the Oblivious were able-bodied, but worthless.) In fact, Grant planned on using the Oblivious as a weapon: make them move to the Loyalist areas and eat up the Loyalists’ food. Of course, a humanitarian would take them in if they were in danger but make them work for their meals. If they didn’t work or were stealing, and that would be most of the Oblivious, then Grant would want to send them off to the Loyalist areas. Good riddance. They would have had their chance in Pierce Point and blown it.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t hate the Oblivious. He was furious at them for being a big reason why the country slid into what it had become. Grant resented the Oblivious for sitting around playing video games or using their FCards to get free stuff while guys like him had to sling an AR-15 and fight for the liberty and safety of everyone, including the Oblivious. He also didn’t relish the thought of having to feed them at Pierce Point. He viewed them as a problem he had to manage.</p>
   <p>But, they were human beings. Grant didn’t want them rounded up and killed. As worthless as they were, they were still Americans and therefore, they were people he was trying to protect. They just made it unnecessarily hard. And he wouldn’t endanger others just to save the Oblivious from the predictable hardship and danger they put themselves in.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about the events leading up to the Collapse and how they led people into the various four camps. Most people were furious at the government for being so inept like with the power outages and fuel shortages. They were furious at the government for being so greedy like all the spending that just went to cronies, but the debt went to them and their children. How could the government they had trusted let this happen?</p>
   <p>The furor only increased the determination and passion of the Patriots. It weakened the resolve of the Loyalists; they were loyal, but loyal to a crappy joke of a government. It was hard to root for a team that sucked so badly.</p>
   <p>The furor impacted the Undecideds the most. They muttered even more under their breaths at all the things that didn’t work. Every time food cost too much or wasn’t available, or when gas wasn’t available, or the power was out, another person in the middle started to think about being a Patriot. They wanted change. They wanted stuff to work. They weren’t quite angry enough to actually risk anything to get it, but they were angry. At some point, they would probably do something to change things. At some point.</p>
   <p>The Oblivious were furious, just not at the government. They weren’t furious at any particular group, they were just furious at the world. What do you mean the power is off? I want to watch TV. Right now. I want some Doritos! Why aren’t there any? I’m pissed. Once the TV came back on or the convenience store had some more Doritos, everything was fine again.</p>
   <p>Furor at the government manifested itself in various ways other than people being more receptive to the Patriots. People labeled by the government as bad—tax protestors, homeowners who had to shoot criminals but who themselves were prosecuted for owning an unregistered gun—became heroes. Even outlaws were viewed more favorably. Gangs, non-violent ones that were independently supplying much wanted items on the black market, like gasoline and luxury items were viewed with sympathy. They became “small businesses” sticking it to “The Man.”</p>
   <p>All this created a jumbled mess, but a mess with four rough categories. Recognizing these categories was critical to having a successful community versus just a group of people barely making it through the Collapse. The way to come out of the Collapse with a strong community was recognizing what motivated Patriots, what demoralized and defeated Loyalists, how to win over Undecideds, and how to pass off as many Oblivious as possible to the Loyalists to deal with. Most of all, having a strong community meant recognizing that the key was practical solutions to make people’s lives better, not political speeches.</p>
   <p>The “masses” weren’t really that important, Grant was realizing. People thought they needed to persuade the masses to get them to do big things. That might have been true when America was a functioning republic and the people’s opinions actually mattered. That was no longer true. Grant realized the Patriots didn’t need to persuade the masses in the beginning. In particular, Grant didn’t need to persuade the majority of the residents of Pierce Point. The support of the masses would be needed down the road to survive the shortages, fight any war that might develop, and, especially, to rebuild. But, at the beginning stages, a small group of leaders was all that was needed. Leaders to run things well and demonstrate to the masses that the Patriot way was the best way. The way to feed them, secure them, and to be fair. The masses would follow the way that works.</p>
   <p>Grant couldn’t shake the distinct feeling that he was one of those leaders. The path of his life, like the deer path that is hard to see but is definitely there, had been pointing toward this. He could see it for a long time. The events that shaped his life, his personality, his skills. The incredible people he met who were now helping him and helping the others. The experiences he had in his job as an attorney fighting corruption and navigating the old political system. His drive to physically prepare for this by, among other things, training to become a pretty decent gunfighter. Most of all, the outside thoughts. All these things made him into the leader who had exactly the right plan at exactly the right time in exactly the right place to show the masses what works and to then say, “Follow me.” People would follow a person like that and do incredible things they never thought they could do. A true leader brought this out in people.</p>

    <p>Chapter 116</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Beards Have All Grown Longer Overnight</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>The next morning, Grant heard people stirring for pancakes. Amazingly, he fell back asleep, despite all the noise, and woke up around noon. Famished, he devoured some left over biscuits, but it wasn’t enough. He needed some protein. Alone at the cabin today, there wasn’t any deer meat being served up by anyone, so he went into the storage shed and got a big can of canned turkey which he wolfed down like some starving guy in a movie. He was finally full.</p>
   <p>Grant remembered he had a crock pot out there; he had purchased it used at a garage sale for $1.00 and took it out to the cabin before the Collapse and practiced cooking refried beans in it. Then he perfected cooking rice in it. Finally, after some trial and error, he perfected cooking crock pot red beans and rice.</p>
   <p>After eight hours slow cooking away in the crock pot, the beans and/or rice came out perfectly. The beans were creamy just like the beans at the taco truck he frequented before the Collapse. They were way better than canned refried beans. When he had perfected the crock pot refried bean and rice recipe, he went back to Cash n’ Carry and got another 100 pounds of beans and 100 pounds of rice. And more spices.</p>
   <p>The spices really helped make the beans and rice go from bland to awesome. He got a few pounds of garlic salt and onion powder. The bulk seasonings at Cash n’ Carry were amazingly cheap. The 100 pounds of beans and spices cost less than $100. It was about the same for the rice. One pound of beans or rice made about a half-gallon, enough to feed his whole family, even when he was hungry from all his physical activity and ate a ton in one sitting. So, $1.00 fed the whole family a meal. Well, the foundation of a meal. They added other things to it. But, in a pinch, that pound of beans or rice and sprinkling of seasoning could be a meal.</p>
   <p>Grant pulled the crock pot out of the basement and got some of the vacuum sealed bags of beans and rice from the storage shed. He gave the recipe to Eileen and she started up a batch.</p>
   <p>After lunch, Grant hung out with the kids for a while. They seemed to be doing fine. Cole missed Grant tucking him in, but he was getting better about it.</p>
   <p>Lisa was at work and Drew had ridden one of the mopeds to the Grange. Eileen said he really like riding it but she thought it was “dangerous.” A moped is dangerous? Grant got a kick out of that.</p>
   <p>Eileen had stopped asking if she could go into town to get some clothes for her, Lisa, and the kids. She knew it wasn’t safe. Grant felt bad because she was making a perfectly reasonable request. In peacetime, at least. But this wasn’t peacetime.</p>
   <p>Grant realized he hadn’t had a shower in…he didn’t even know how long. He was stunned that Lisa let his stinky carcass sleep in the same bed with her. But she must have been as tired as he was and just passed out in bed.</p>
   <p>For the first time in many days, Grant looked in the mirror. Whoa. He had a week’s worth of beard. He couldn’t remember when he last shaved. “The beards have all grown longer overnight,” Grant sang. It was a line from the song “Won’t Get Fooled Again” by The Who. That song described how a socialist revolution fools the people and how things under the new government don’t change much. “Meet the new boss. Same as the old boss,” was one of the other lines. That song perfectly described the United States…or whatever the country was now.</p>
   <p>Grant thought about it: The beards <emphasis>had</emphasis> grown longer overnight. Guys weren’t shaving regularly. The Team was looking pretty shaggy, except for Pow. Asian guys don’t grow beards as quickly as white guys.</p>
   <p>The Team looked pretty badass with beards. They truly looked like military contractors now. The beards on the constables of Pierce Point said something like “We’re too busy shooting looters to shave.” Grant thought that was a good image for others to see.</p>
   <p>As badass as the beard was, Granted wanted to shave. It would make the shower complete. It would make the freshness complete. He started to shave. He hated shaving during peacetime, but suddenly found that now he loved it. Shaving, and showering for that matter, meant there was a lull in the work and he had shaving equipment and hot water. Those were luxuries now.</p>
   <p>After shaving, Grant took a shower. He felt like a new man; he felt… civilized... The shower washed away the stress and grime that had been his life for the past few days. He felt lighter, springy, floaty. Clean. Decent. Civilized. Normal.</p>
   <p>After taking the long and wonderful hot shower, Grant went into the master bedroom to get ready. He saw a pair of Lisa’s socks on her nightstand, which looked odd because she never left things lying around. He picked them up and, to his surprise, found the .38 underneath the socks. It had one of his trigger locks on it. Yep, sure enough the key was in the nightstand drawer. Not exactly Quick Draw McGraw material, but better than nothing. Lisa might be changing her mind about things.</p>
   <p>That reminded him that Lisa was at the Grange and going out on house calls without any guns. He needed to make sure the medical team had security. Some druggies or a crazy off their meds might want to storm the clinic. Or, maybe if a Patriot/Loyalist split got nasty, the Loyalists would want to bring down one of the most important services the Patriots were providing to win hearts and minds: the clinic. That was it–the medical team needed security.</p>
   <p>Just then, Chip came into Grant’s cabin. He was looking for his pocket knife. Grant realized that Chip would make a great security man for the medical team. He wouldn’t have to break down any doors, Grant trusted him with his life—and his wife’s—and he was great with close quarters gun fighting.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Chip,” Grant said, “would you be interested in providing security for the medical team? Hanging out at the Grange and going with them on house calls?” Grant knew the answer.</p>
   <p>Chip smiled. “That’d be great. But do you trust a handsome devil like me to be around Dr. Foxy all day?” He winked at Grant. It was impossible not to love this guy.</p>
   <p>They talked about the details. Grant wondered if Mark could take him and Chip to the Grange to talk to Rich about this, but Mark was out hunting with John, which was a better use of their time than driving people around and burning gas. They were going to have to come up with a better transportation system.</p>
   <p>Grant got on his pistol belt, put on his tactical vest, grabbed his AR, got on his moped, and headed to work. A tactical vest and moped. Two things not normally paired together.</p>
   <p>When he pulled into the Grange, Grant saw several other mopeds. Someone Grant had seen at the Grange meetings, but whose name he couldn’t recall, pointed to the mopeds and said to Grant, “Pretty cool, huh? Some people brought them by a few minutes ago. They’ve been donated for the constables.”</p>
   <p>“The what?” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“You know, the constables,” the guy said. “Your Team. You know, you said at the meeting that they were the constables.”</p>
   <p>Grant was embarrassed. He’d forgotten he said that. “Oh, right,” he said. “Of course. Cool.”</p>
   <p>Grant went in the Grange and looked for Rich and was told that he went to the gate because there was some big thing going on. Grant raced out. He saw Lisa and waved at her. She smiled but was busy, too; he wished he could have talked to her. Grant zoomed—to the extent a moped can “zoom”—to the gate, which took a few minutes. There was a commotion. A car was at the gate with several people standing around it.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on?” Grant asked a guard, a teenage kid with an SKS rifle.</p>
   <p>“Someone,” the kid said, “who lives over on Tamber Road,” which was in Pierce Point, “just came back from town and said things are pretty bad.”</p>
   <p>Grant went up to the crowd to hear the story. A man in his thirties and his wife were in one of the cars telling everyone what had happened.</p>
   <p>“The blue ribbon guys,” the man in the car said, “guarding the entrance to Frederickson now have some ‘FC’ guys. Some guys with military clothes and these yellow hard hats on. One of the blue ribbon guys said that the ‘FC’ was the ‘Freedom Corps’ sent in from Olympia. They’re a civilian auxiliary or something. The FC didn’t have guns but were telling the guards what to do.”</p>
   <p>“That’s good, right?” one of the Pierce Point guards said. “The authorities are here and helping.”</p>
   <p>Some guards shook their heads “no,” a few nodded “yes,” but most didn’t react. The idea of the authorities riding in to save the day seemed so unrealistic to them.</p>
   <p>“The Mexicans,” the guy said, “have blocked the west side,” which was the Mexican part of town. “The blue ribbon guys said not to go there. The gangs—I didn’t even know there were any major gangs in Frederickson, but I guess there are now—won’t let you in unless you’re Mexican. Except if you want to buy stuff. They have gas in gas cans they’re selling. For cash and those FCards that Martin’s is now taking,” he said, referring to the grocery store in town.</p>
   <p>The man perked up with some excitement. “Oh, speaking of that store, when I was in town there was a rumor that Martin’s was getting a load of food. People swarmed there. We went, too, and people started fighting for a spot by a truck that was docked in the back where they unload stuff. Some cops came along with some Mexican dudes. They beat back everyone and stood guard around the truck. It looked weird: the cops and the gang bangers were, like, on the same side or something. We left. It took us awhile to get back to the gate out of town. I shouldn’t be in town anyway, but my wife wanted to get some things,” the man said, looking at her. She shot back a cold glare.</p>
   <p>Then she yelled at him. “You wanted to get some cigarettes, you asshole. Don’t blame this on me, you son of a bitch.” It would be frosty at their house for a while.</p>
   <p>The man looked embarrassed. He continued, “Anyway, when we were at the gate going out of town, one of the blue ribbon guys said the cops—what’s left of them, which isn’t many—and the gangs took the food from Martin’s and now are selling it. The FC guy heard what the blue ribbon guy said and just shrugged.”</p>
   <p>Great. Gangs and rogue cops and the government were running a giant racket called the City of Frederickson. At least a truck of food got in. But, now the gangs had it. Nice.</p>
   <p>Grant wondered if the whole country was like this. He figured the bigger cities would be worse. Olympia would be bad, Seattle worse, and God forbid imagining what was going on in L.A. right now.</p>
   <p>Just then, Grant noticed some of the Pierce Point guards scurrying around. There was a black man with his hands up walking slowly toward the bridge.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at the man. He knew—he just knew—that this was important.</p>
   <p><emphasis>I am providing for you.</emphasis></p>

    <p><emphasis>Gideon Arrives</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant yelled to the guards, “Lower your weapons! Don’t shoot him.” Grant had no idea why he was yelling this. He just knew that they needed this guy walking toward them. It was like Grant knew the guy. But he didn’t.</p>
   <p>The black man got about twenty-five yards from the gate and, out of breath, yelled, “You need to come quick. Come quick. Before it’s too late.”</p>
   <p>Grant ran toward him. The other members of the Team followed Grant out of instinct. They didn’t know why, but they assumed Grant knew something they didn’t know. Which was true. Grant knew he needed to help this man, he just didn’t know why.</p>
   <p>The dogs were going wild and Dan yelled, “What the hell are you doing?” Grant and the Team kept running. Grant came up to the black man and said, “How can we help?”</p>
   <p>The man, a blue collar looking guy in his forties, was surprised these well-armed white militia-looking guys just ran over to him and asked how they could help. He expected militia types to not like people with his skin color much.</p>
   <p>“My truck,” the black man said. “My truck. Some guys are trying to steal it.” He started to put his hand in his pocket and realized that that was a bad idea. He pointed to his front pocket and said, “I have the keys in here. They’re coming after me!”</p>
   <p>“Who?” Wes asked.</p>
   <p>“Where?” Bobby asked.</p>
   <p>“How many?” Scotty asked.</p>
   <p>“Come on,” Grant yelled as he started running across the bridge and up the road where the man had just come down. “Let’s go!” Once again, the Team followed Grant, assuming he knew something they didn’t.</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for the man to take the lead and show them where the truck was, which he did. They came to the intersection of where Pierce Point Road connected to the road to Frederickson. The black man pointed to the right. Grant shouldered his AR and went around the corner. He paused and motioned for the others to come, too. They did, just like they’d practiced a million times at the range.</p>
   <p>Sure enough. A few hundred yards down the road was a semi-truck parked on the side of the road with its hazard lights on.</p>
   <p>The black man yelled, “There were two of them. They still might be around, but I don’t see their car. Be careful. They had weapons.” Grant noticed that he said “weapons” instead of “guns.” He must have some military or law enforcement experience to use a term like that.</p>
   <p>It was time for the Team to do its first SWAT work. Let’s see if we’re any good or whether we die right here and now, Grant thought. He was serious. They might die in the next few seconds.</p>
   <p>The Team fanned out and started looking for bad guys. There were no cars on the road, as traffic had been virtually non-existent. Grant stayed with the black man.</p>
   <p>“What’s your name?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Gideon. Gideon Armstrong,” he said.</p>
   <p>“OK, Gideon, what happened?” Grant said, a little winded. He was in decent shape, but this sprinting and mentally preparing to be in a gun fight tired him out.</p>
   <p>“I’m driving,” Gideon said, winded. “I have just one more load and then I’m done. I knew this was dangerous, but the money was great. So I see a police car blocking the road up there,” he said pointing up the road away from the gate. “I slow down. ‘Great, some cops are gonna jack my load’, I say to myself.”</p>
   <p>“Are the bad guys cops?” Grant asked quickly. He wanted to know who to be looking out for. He didn’t have time to chat.</p>
   <p>“Kinda,” Gideon said. “They were in a cop car, but they had on BDUs” Gideon said. Using the term “BDUs”, which stood for “battle dress uniforms,” told Grant that Gideon had been in the Army or other military service in the 80s or 90s when that term was used to describe woodland camouflage fatigues.</p>
   <p>“Did they have hard hats?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Gideon’s eyes lit up. “Yeah! Yellow ones. How did you know?”</p>
   <p>Grant yelled to the Team, “Be looking for a cop car with FCs in hard hats and fatigues.” He looked back to Gideon and said, “Where are they now?”</p>
   <p>Gideon looked up and down the road and said, “I don’t know, man. They were here a few minutes ago.” Then he put his hand on his pocket. “The keys. I took the keys.” He thought a while.</p>
   <p>“It happened so fast,” Gideon said. “Now I remember. One had a gun pointed at me and the other motioned for me to roll down the window. I did. The one without the gun said he was ‘commandeering’ the truck. I’m like, ‘hell no, you’re not’. So I took the keys out of the ignition, raised my hands, and got out of the cab.”</p>
   <p>Gideon went on, “I knew these white boys—no offense—would shoot my ass once they got what I’m hauling. It’s pretty valuable,” he said with a smile. “So I had nothing to lose. Besides, my home is back in Philly so I’m pretty much dead here now, anyway. So I tell them, ‘It’s yours’ and I walk away with my hands up. Those dumb asses didn’t even realize I took the keys out of the ignition. They were high fiving each other just staring at the truck, like they won. Well, shit, they can’t move that trailer far without the cab running. So I start running down the road and I see the entrance to your place. Then I see your guards and I think, ‘Oh shit. They’ll shoot me too.’ That’s what happened.”</p>
   <p>“Where is the cop car?” Grant yelled. He wanted to know right now.</p>
   <p>“Dunno,” Gideon said. “They might have left when they realized that I had the keys. Or they might be going back to get some bolt cutters for the locks on the back.”</p>
   <p>Grant realized they needed to get that truck moving and into Pierce Point. “Get it running and go across the bridge where the guards are. I’ll tell them to let you in. Move. I don’t want those FC coming back.”</p>
   <p>“FC?” Gideon asked.</p>
   <p>“Later,” Grant yelled as he ran toward the Team. “We’ll talk later. Move that thing now. We’ll cover you.”</p>
   <p>“Roger that,” Gideon said. He jumped up in the cab and started it up.</p>
   <p>Grant yelled to Pow, who was closest to the gate, “Tell them it’s OK for this guy to bring the truck in. And tell them to be ready to shoot up a cop car if one comes by.”</p>
   <p>Pow yelled, “Roger” and started running toward the bridge.</p>
   <p>Grant ran up to the rest of the Team, who had taken cover around the truck and were scanning the area, and told them what was going on. No sign of a cop car or any other car so far.</p>
   <p>The truck slowly lumbered down the shoulder and turned onto Pierce Point Road. Grant motioned for the Team to come back. They retreated with one man closest to the threat—the road to Frederickson—covering the road while the others ran back toward the bridge. As soon as the last man got to cover, he yelled, “Set!” That was the signal for the man closest to the threat to turn and run back toward the bridge. A leap frogging retreat. They’d done this on the range a bunch of times. Special Forces Ted had taught them. They weren’t perfect doing it today, but they didn’t practice this for a living. Even with the flaws, Ryan was impressed. He fit right in, executing his cover right when he heard “Set!”</p>
   <p>Grant was one of the first to the gate. The guards were looking at him like he was on drugs. Rich and Dan came running up and yelling, “What the hell?”</p>
   <p>“FC tried to steal this guy’s truck,” Grant said, winded.</p>
   <p>Rich and Dan weren’t sure that was a good answer. Why was Grant letting this stranger drive a truck—possibly filled with looters—through the gate?</p>
   <p>Dan yelled to the guards, “Cover that truck. If people come out the back, shoot ‘em!”</p>
   <p>This was the first action the guards had seen, and they were jumping around. Dan looked toward the hill where the snipers were and motioned with his arm.</p>
   <p>Gideon parked the truck and put his hands out the window. Grant ran up and said, “Move this over there,” pointing to the volunteer fire station. “I don’t want people seeing that we have your truck.”</p>
   <p>Gideon nodded. He started to drive. Some of the guards yelled, “Stop!”</p>
   <p>Grant ran around the truck yelling, “Let him drive it! Let him drive!” The guards, too, assumed that Grant knew something they didn’t.</p>
   <p>Finally, the truck was parked so it couldn’t be seen from the road. The Team was behind cover on and near the bridge, sweeping the entrance with their rifles. Any cop car driving down the road would be cut to pieces in seconds.</p>
   <p>Grant ran back toward the gate and yelled to the guards, “Be on the lookout for a cop car. Shoot it. Got it? Shoot the cop car.” The guards slowly nodded. They were in shock. No one had ever told them to shoot a cop car before.</p>
   <p>Grant yelled for the Team to retreat across the bridge while the guards covered them. The guards were clumsily covering the bridge as they started streaming back. The Team was definitely smoother than the guards, but there were way more guards.</p>
   <p>Grant was at the gate, trying to catch his breath when the Team started coming up to him.</p>
   <p>“What just happened?” Pow asked. “Who is this guy?”</p>
   <p>“I dunno,” Grant said.</p>

    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“What?” Ryan said. “You dunno?”</p>
   <p>“I dunno who he is,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“Why the hell did you let him in?” Rich asked as he came up.</p>
   <p>“I felt like I should,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“What?” Several people said in unison.</p>
   <p>Al, the immigration guy, the former Border Patrol agent from the meeting at the Grange, came up and angrily asked, “Who let this guy in?”</p>
   <p>Rich pointed at Grant.</p>
   <p>“Why did you let him in?” Al asked.</p>
   <p>“I dunno,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>Grant realized how stupid that sounded. He needed to give a better explanation. Except he didn’t have one. So he made something up.</p>
   <p>“You’ll see,” Grant said as he walked toward the truck. “You’ll see,” he repeated.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t know for sure what was in there, but he knew in his gut that they needed to rescue the driver and bring the trailer in. He knew they needed to do this fast before they got caught.</p>
   <p>Gideon was standing outside the cab with his hands up with about a dozen rifles pointed at him and the truck. He was starting to get nervous surrounded by all these rednecks with guns. Gideon was beginning to fear that he had walked into some white power compound. He had been told by his company and the news that these types of compounds were springing up everywhere and that the “Don’t Tread on Me” flag was a Nazi militia symbol. Other drivers said that was a lie, like just about everything else the company and the news were saying. Gideon hadn’t actually seen any signs of it out there as he drove across the country.</p>
   <p>Just as he was getting really nervous about all the white guys in hunting clothes pointing rifles at him, he saw an Asian guy who looked like a tactical badass. Gideon scanned the guards and also saw two Hispanic looking guys. That was a relief. This surely wasn’t some white power compound.</p>
   <p>Grant said to Gideon, “Open the trailer.”</p>
   <p>“The keys to the padlocks are in the cab. Can I get them?” Gideon asked.</p>
   <p>“I’ll get them,” Grant said. He got up in the cab and found a key ring. He came down and asked Gideon, “These them?”</p>
   <p>Gideon nodded.</p>
   <p>Grant ran to the rear of the trailer and started to open the locks. There were three of them.</p>
   <p>Grant opened up the trailer door and gasped. He could not believe his eyes.</p>
   <p>Gideon came running to the trailer door. “I was bringing a load to a grocery store called Martin’s. This is a semi load of food. Non-perishable. Want to see the paper work on it?”</p>
   <p>The guards exploded with whooping and hollering. They were jumping up and down.</p>
   <p>Grant’s knees gave way. He fell to the ground. He was overtaken with emotion. They’d eat for weeks! The constant worrying about having enough food was over. He was ecstatic.</p>
   <p>Everyone was screaming with joy. Rich yelled to Grant, “How did you know what was in there!”</p>
   <p>“I didn’t,” Grant said as he shrugged. “I just knew it was stuff we needed. I just knew.” He wasn’t about to explain the outside thoughts and how they had always been right. No one would believe him.</p>
   <p>Grant looked inside the semi-trailer. It was full of huge cases of beans, rice, biscuit and pancake mix, and stacked high with cases of canned meat , soups, and vegetables. Grant saw jams and cases of peanut butter, even cookies and crackers. He smiled and then he started laughing out loud.</p>
   <p>There was so much food in there. Pierce Point could serve meals from this truck for…Grant had no idea, but it would be a long time. They would be able to provide food when the government couldn’t.</p>
   <p>Grant realized that the FC would be coming back to get “their” truck. Let them. Let the first blood be those FC dickheads. Let the Undecideds realize who was feeding them and who was trying to take it away.</p>
   <p>“Get that damned truck up to the Grange and post a guard,” Dan said. He was smiling. “Nicely done, Mr. Matson. Nicely done.”</p>
   <p>Grant realized that the FC, or cops, or whomever would be looking for the black truck driver. “We’ll get Gideon to the Grange and have him hide out there,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>Dan nodded and then asked, “What if someone asks who the new guy is?”</p>
   <p>Grant smiled and said, “We’ll tell them he’s Chip’s cousin.” Chip, who was white, could actually convince someone of that. Dan laughed, and then turned serious. Grant knew what he was going to say next.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I know,” Grant said to Dan, “prepare for an attack.” Grant looked out toward the gate and said to Dan, “The FC will be coming to call. It’s not like we can have five hundred households here keep a secret like this. Well, Dan, we’ll see how good our defenses are pretty soon. What, you figure around night fall?”</p>
   <p>Dan nodded. He started yelling orders to the guards to double up, be alert, and shoot any cop cars. “Shoot to kill anyone coming across that bridge until further orders.” It sounded so weird to hear someone actually say that.</p>
   <p>Rich was on the radio, one of the ham radios instead of the CBs, calling in to Linda the dispatcher at the Grange. He wanted every able bodied and armed man to come to the gate. “Tell the Chief to be ready for an attack from the water, too,” Rich said into the radio.</p>
   <p>Rich’s very serious look when he was on the radio changed to a smile as he was looking at the semi-truck full of food.</p>
   <p>“You seriously had no idea what was in that truck?” Rich asked Grant.</p>
   <p>“Kinda,” Grant said. “It’s hard to explain. Maybe over some Pendleton. It’s…hard to explain.” Grant hoped he didn’t sound too weird.</p>
   <p>“I’ll bet,” Rich said. “Well, no meeting tonight. We’ve got an attack coming.”</p>
   <p>“Could I respectfully disagree?” Grant asked. “Not about the attack. Yeah, we’ll see some action tonight. But I disagree about not having a meeting. We need to get the message out right now that we have secured a load of food and that the community will be deciding what to do with it. I don’t want people’s expectations to be that they’ll get a bunch of food. I want to hold onto the food as a reserve and only use it when people have exhausted their own supplies. Like around winter. I have an idea on how to do that I’ll tell you later.”</p>
   <p>Man, this guy thinks of all the political angles, Rich thought. Not “political” as in “vote for me,” but as in getting people to work together as much as possible. Rich was very glad to have Grant around. He wasn’t a military genius, but those political and administrative ideas of his were solid.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said. “You go up to the Grange and give out the message you want to give out and then get back down here with all the guys as soon as you can. I’m staying here with Dan to coordinate our defenses.”</p>
   <p>“We need to get that semi up to the Grange for safekeeping,” Grant said. “I’ll have Gideon drive it up there.”</p>
   <p>“Who’s Gideon?” Rich said. Grant pointed toward him.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah, do that,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>Grant ran over to Gideon and told him to get in the cab and follow him. They went to the back of the trailer to lock it up. Some of the guards were concerned about why they were there to lock up the goodies. Were they jacking it from them?</p>
   <p>Grant explained, “We’re just taking it to the Grange for safekeeping. Grab two guards and get in the cab.” Two guys jumped into the cab.</p>
   <p>Grant told Gideon to follow him as he rode in front on his moped. He saw Pow and said, “Hey, we’ll probably be attacked tonight. You and one other guy need to go back to the yellow cabin and get all the ammo and magazines you can. Get all our spare rifles. AKs, shotguns, you name it. There will be some new guys on guard duty tonight. Bring all that shit. Get a truck to bring it down.”</p>
   <p>Grant got on his moped and continued on toward the Grange with Gideon and the cab full of guards following him. They had to get there quickly. The attack might be minutes away.</p>
   <p>On the five-minute ride there, Grant collected his thoughts. He would park the truck and have at least two guards on it. He’d have someone get Chip up there, who could manage the guards. Grant thanked God that Chip was out there. It was just one of the many things Grant thanked God for on that five-minute ride back to the Grange.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted “his” guys to be in charge of the food and be seen by the community as in charge of it. Not that he wanted to take all the food; quite the opposite, he had enough food for his family and he wanted to distribute the food as widely as possible. But, he wanted the residents to see that he and his guys were the problem solvers, the people to go to and the ones who get things done. Guarding a semi full of food when the stores were closed sends a powerful “can-do” message, and would make them very popular. And Grant knew they would need all the friends and supporters possible for what was coming.</p>
   <p>There was no way he could prevent a vote on how to distribute the food, although he wished he could. He was no dictator, but he was worried that people would want to divide it up among 500 or so households, which would be a pittance per person. However, there was no way to hide the food or convince people that Grant alone got to decide what to do with it. This was a difficult problem to solve. So he started thinking as hard as he could.</p>
   <p>He knew that the first message that went out in the rumor mill—and news of a semi full of food would spread like wildfire—would be what people would assume the plan was. It was important to be the first one to get the message out. Just like in politics. Wait, Grant laughed to himself, this <emphasis>was</emphasis> politics.</p>
   <p>Distributing the food made Grant momentarily wonder if he was becoming a socialist. Does the collective get to decide how to divide up other people’s property? Nope.</p>
   <p>First of all, they were at war. Most people at Pierce Point didn’t realize it, but they were. An undeclared, informal low-intensity war. That semi was the “spoils of war.” It went to supplying the troops and the civilians supporting the troops. That’s how spoils work. At least, when the capturing force is decent instead of looters, who just take it for themselves. Captured goods go to support the military forces that captured it. It’s like paying for a military, but with the other side’s stuff.</p>
   <p>Second, there was the practical problem of who owned the food. The government? Who would it be returned to? The FC and the gangs? That would just get it back to the “government” or to the boss running Frederickson, if the FC didn’t steal it for themselves first. What if Gideon’s company owned it? How would he get it back to them? The truck would be hijacked a few miles down the road. At the gate to Frederickson, for sure. So there was no way to return the truck.</p>
   <p>A final reason that distributing the food wasn’t considered socialism was…well, payback. Technically, the food belonged to the government, which had nationalized the food and trucks. Well, the government owed the people in Pierce Point several million dollars. The government had seized their bank accounts. The government had taken their property for years through environmental regulations. The government had taxed them at absurd levels. The government had taken way more than a semi of food from these people. Now the people were getting back some of what had been stolen from them. It could be considered “returning stolen property,” even though Grant just kind of stole it himself. Kind of, but not really.</p>
   <p>The fact that the semi was the spoils of war explained why the food would be distributed, but not how. Grant remembered an ingenious solution for this problem from one of his favorite novels, <emphasis>One Second After</emphasis>. In it, the community had to decide how to distribute food. They wanted people to use their own reserves first before dipping into the community food. They also didn’t want to be an authoritarian government. So they came up with the meal card system.</p>
   <p>Under the meal card system, a person was obligated to use up their own food first. If they chose to accept a meal card—and some did not—they thereby agreed to let the community come into their house and inspect it to ensure that they did not have any food. This was all voluntary. The meal card got them one good meal every day cooked at the community facility. They got a meal to eat there, not food to carry back to their houses where they could sell it.</p>
   <p>There was another important feature of the meal card system: they had to work for the meal card (except if they were disabled or elderly). They had to do something for the community for their meals. There were no free loaders.</p>
   <p>Yet another important feature of the meal card was that there was no favoritism to it. If a person worked (or was disabled) and they agreed to allow inspection of their home, they ate. Period. There were no political tests or some families getting more, or girlfriends eating without working—none of that. If they contributed to the community, they got to eat one meal a day. Period.</p>
   <p>There was a subtle, but important, political component to the meal card. While everyone who worked and allowed inspections got one, the community could yank the card if people broke the rules. If a person was hoarding food, the meal card was taken away for a period of time (roughly until their hoarded food was exhausted). If someone stole, their card was yanked. Grant thought this was a great system.</p>
   <p>As he came up on the Grange and saw the Grange, he realized he had another problem: where to store the truck. Grant wanted it to remain a secret that they had all this food, and especially where it was located. This would make it harder for someone to steal. But it was too late to stop the word from spreading about the truck. The rumor mill would be on overdrive. Two dozen guards had seen the truck. Besides, if they hid it, people would accuse them of stealing the food.</p>
   <p>No, the existence and location of the semi full of food needed to be totally transparent, which meant that hiding the truck somewhere wouldn’t work. Besides, the Grange was emerging as the headquarters with many assets to be heavily defended, like the medical team and, now, the semi of food. Grant quickly decided they would keep the semi at the Grange. Chip’s guards could secure it there. Besides, the political symbolism was perfect: Come to the Grange, be part of the community, and see all we have to offer those who cooperate with the community.</p>
   <p>Racing to the Grange—well, “racing” on a moped—made Grant realize they needed to have a better alert system for mobilizing troops for the gate. They’d work on that. Grant had big thoughts like this constantly zooming through his mind. He was thinking so clearly it was spooky. He felt so alive. He was meant to do this.</p>
   <p>Grant arrived at the Grange and pulled into the parking lot. He got off his moped and ran in to get some help. He explained what was going on and told someone to drive to his cabin and get Chip, and to tell him to command the guard of the truck. “Chip’ll know what to do,” Grant yelled to the person who was going to get him.</p>
   <p>Grant was explaining to everyone what had happened and that no one could touch the food. He looked at the two guards who rode there in Gideon’s cab and, in front of everyone, told them they were authorized to shoot anyone who touched the truck. Grant had the padlock keys, but he didn’t tell anyone that. He asked Gideon for the keys to the ignition. He was happy to turn them over so no one would try to beat them out of him. Gideon was still a little leery of this gated white community he had just driven into.</p>
   <p>Grant made sure people knew that Gideon was a welcomed guest. Grant said, “Mr. Armstrong here is a crime victim, a victim of attempted robbery, so please extend him every courtesy.” Grant wanted the first version of the rumor mill story to be “this guy got his stuff stolen and our guys rescued him.” He was conscious that every single thing he said would be repeated dozens of times, so he needed to be very careful to think of the impact of his words. This was serious business.</p>
   <p>Then he had an idea. A pretty damned good one.</p>

    <p>Chapter 119</p>
    <p><emphasis>Operation Head Fake</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>A crowd had gathered around the semi and the black stranger. Grant asked the assembled people, largely the Grange ladies and the medical staff, “Who here in Pierce Point has a semi-truck or trailer? Do we have any truck drivers out here who have their rigs parked at their house?”</p>
   <p>“Doug Smithson out on Frog Lake Road,” one of the Grange ladies said. “I saw his rig there this morning.”</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for Gideon to come over to him. He whispered something to Gideon, who laughed and nodded.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Grant said, “slight change in plans. I need someone to drive me and the guards to the Smithson place. Gideon, you follow us in your truck. I need one person in the cab with Gideon who knows where the Smithsons live in case we get separated.” A Grange lady raised her hand and walked up to Gideon. They shook hands, which seemed strangely formal but normal at the same time.</p>
   <p>They took off. Grant was in someone’s truck. They drove a few miles to the far eastern end of Pierce Point, to the Smithson place. Grant got out at the gate and motioned for the guards to keep an eye out for anyone who might have been following them. There were dogs. Grant waited until someone came out. It was a man with a shotgun. He looked like he’d been sleeping. Oh great, Grant thought. I’ve pissed off a tired man with a shotgun—and a guy I’m about to ask if I can have his truck. Not a great first impression.</p>
   <p>Grant put his hands up and yelled, “Mr. Smithson? We need your help. I’m Grant Matson. I’m with the Pierce Point constables.”</p>
   <p>The man seemed to recognize the term “constables.” He came up to Grant and looked at the semi idling on the road outside his gate. He noticed the guards. He seemed to recognize one of the guards. He lowered his shotgun and came over to Grant.</p>
   <p>“I’m Doug Smithson. What do you want?” He was not happy to be awoken by men with guns.</p>
   <p>“Do you have an empty trailer we could borrow for a little while?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“For what?” Smithson asked.</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for Gideon to come over. Grant explained that they had a semi-trailer full of food, which made Smithson smile, and that they needed to hook up Smithson’s empty semi-trailer and take it down to the gate.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “We’re calling this Operation Head Fake.” Smithson smiled again.</p>
   <p>Smithson asked, “So who owns the food?”</p>
   <p>Grant said, “The government, I guess. But it’s ours now. You OK with that?”</p>
   <p>“Hell yes,” Smithson said. “Those bastards have stolen from me for years. Do you know what I’ve paid in fuel taxes? I’m happy to help get a little back. Bastards.”</p>
   <p>Subverting the government was so much easier when they’d been dicks to so many people, Grant realized.</p>
   <p>Gideon and Smithson worked on the plan. Smithson had the room to switch the trailers on their trucks right there at his place. With Grant riding along, Gideon would drive his cab and the empty Smithson trailer back to the gate. Smithson would drive his cab and the trailer full of food back to the Grange, which would be protected by the guards.</p>
   <p>“One more thing,” Gideon said as the trailers were switched. He looked at Smithson and asked, “You got some paperwork on this empty load?”</p>
   <p>“Sure do,” Smithson said. He went back into the house and came out with some papers. “Looks like you got a legit empty load.”</p>
   <p>Grant got on the CB in Gideon’s cab. He called the Grange and asked if Chip was there yet. He had just walked in. Grant said, in semi coded language, that Smithson and two guards would be coming to the Grange and that Chip was to command the guard of that truck. If Smithson didn’t get there in a half hour, Chip was to radio Grant on that same channel.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted Smithson to go first and for Gideon to follow them. He basically trusted Smithson and the gate guards riding along, but not 100%. He wanted to watch them roll up to the Grange and for Chip to take over. Then, and only then, would Grant feel comfortable leaving the trailer full of food there. People would literally kill for that truck load of food—and probably would later that night when the attack came.</p>
   <p>Smithson pulled into the Grange, and Chip, with full kit on, waved to Grant and gave him the thumbs up. Gideon and Grant kept going down the road toward the gate. It was actually going pretty well, so far.</p>
   <p>As Gideon’s cab came up to the gate, the guards were puzzled. Dan ran up with his hands in the air, screaming, “What the hell?” Was Grant trying to return the truck and food?</p>
   <p>Grant wasn’t going to get on the CB and tell them about Operation Head Fake. And he didn’t have a ham radio, although he probably wouldn’t have discussed the topic even on that radio.</p>
   <p>He jumped out of the cab and motioned for Gideon to park the rig in plain sight of the gate. Dan and Rich ran up to Grant, with the Team close behind. It looked like the Team had all its extra gear there and had handed out some AKs and tactical shotguns to some of the new volunteers. Once again, Grant felt so alive.</p>
   <p>“OK, here’s what’s going on,” Grant said to everyone. “Now before I tell you about this, I need all of you to swear not to talk about this. You understand? Talking about this will get people killed. Who here wants to get people killed?”</p>
   <p>No one said a word.</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought,” Grant said. “OK, see that trailer? Looks like the one we rescued, right?” Grant said this loudly so everyone could hear.</p>
   <p>Most nodded.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Grant said holding the paperwork up, “I have documentation that this trailer is empty. You see, it was an empty load last week from Tacoma. Anyone want to see?”</p>
   <p>Everyone looked puzzled.</p>
   <p>“Go ahead and look in the back. It’s empty,” Grant said with obvious pride. “Yep, it looks like that black guy had an empty load. He brought it in here, parked it, and started to walk down the road toward Frederickson. Right? Right, guys? Some mystery man abandoned his empty rig here and left.”</p>
   <p>Gideon waved at them and started laughing. “I ain’t here. I’m a ghost,” he said.</p>
   <p>“So there’s nothing for the government or the gangs to come and get,” Grant said. “Just an empty truck. Hell, they can have it. Then they need to go back to Frederickson and start looking for a black man. You guys see what I’m sayin’?” Grant had a huge grin on this face. The only thing better than capturing a semi load of food was making the government look stupid in the process.</p>
   <p>Everyone started to get it. Many were laughing and high fiving. Someone asked, “Where’s the real trailer?”</p>
   <p>“At the Grange under guard,” Grant said. “Where it will stay. Just so everyone knows, I have hidden the keys to the trailer padlocks in a safe place.” Actually, Grant had the keys on him, but with an AR and a pistol, his pocket was a “safe place.” Later he planned to tell Rich that he had the keys. The guy in charge needed to know everything.</p>
   <p>“I left instructions at the Grange for how we’re going to handle the food,” Grant said. “We’ll have a vote to approve this plan, but the plan is the plan for right now. You gotta act quick to take advantage of these things,” Grant said with a smile.</p>
   <p>It had only been an hour and half since Grant saw Gideon walking across the bridge. They had done a lot in that hour and half. They had secured a semi load of food and set out a distribution plan. All this quick action was possible because, when Grant saw Gideon, the outside thought told him to help a complete stranger. The ideas about the meal card came from reading a book, years earlier. The idea about the empty trailer came from…who knows where, but there it was. Operation Head Fake was off and running. Now it just had to work.</p>

    <p><emphasis>Preparing for Attack</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was late afternoon and Grant knew the day was just beginning. He would be up all night again. He was glad he got all those caffeine pills a few years ago when he was storing away supplies. They had a shelf life of several years and were cheap, back then. Good luck finding them now. When he was preparing for all of this, he had a feeling he’d be pulling long nights on guard duty, and tonight was one of them. Well, not guard duty. Probably actual fighting.</p>
   <p>Operation Head Fake, phase one, was complete.</p>
   <p>Dan’s dogs were well behaved, which wasn’t a surprise. Dan had them tied up in a shaded area of the fire station. Despite all the activity and noise, they just sat quietly. Every once in a while Dan would come and pet them.</p>
   <p>Cars and trucks started heading down the road from the Grange to the gate. The Grange ladies—Grant needed to learn their names, but he was always so busy when he saw them—were bringing enough food to choke a horse. They were loving this, getting to cook for all these people. It was like having all the grandkids over, except people were about to try to kill all the “grandkids” they were feeding.</p>
   <p>“Eat up,” Dan yelled. “It’s going to be a long night.” He said it like he’d said it many times before in the Air Force.</p>
   <p>Next, a car came to the gate with the medical team. There was Lisa. Some of the guards hadn’t seen her yet and they were gawking. A couple made comments about the hot chick. It didn’t bother Grant. In fact, he found having twenty-something guys think his forty-something wife was hot was quite an honor.</p>
   <p>Ryan looked at Grant and said, “Dr. Foxy is here.” That nickname spread among the guards. It was all good fun, Grant thought. Besides, these guys were about to be in the first gunfight of their lives, so they deserved a light moment. Reflecting on the gunfight he was in with the looters back in Olympia, he knew how much they would change after this.</p>
   <p>Lisa found Grant and came up to him. She was a little bewildered. She’d seen Grant and the Team walking around in kit and with guns, but she’d never seen anything like the gate. There were about two dozen armed men, some looking very military. There was a seriousness in the air. There was a gate over a bridge that she used to drive across on leisurely trips out to a cabin. Now it looked like a war zone. There was a bustle and hubbub of military preparations that was unmistakable. Lisa had never experienced it, and never expected to experience it. She was a nice girl who became a doctor and expected to live an easy suburban life. Now she was at a soon-to-be battlefield preparing to treat gunshot wounds. Lots of them. She was concerned about the teenage kids with hunting rifles who didn’t seem to know what they were doing.</p>
   <p>She also worried about Grant. She was terrified that she would watch him get shot and would have the image burned in her memory forever. It was hard enough to be a suburban mother turned battlefield doctor, but worrying about having to watch her husband get killed or maimed was too much.</p>
   <p>For a second, Lisa thought that this was all Grant’s fault. There probably wasn’t a battle like this back in Olympia. The stores were probably open and the police were keeping order there. It was stupid to be out here in Hillbillyville.</p>
   <p>Then she remembered how things were when they left Olympia, and she knew that it had only gotten worse since then. No, she was actually glad Grant had this cabin out here and stored up all that food and even had those horrible guns. She knew she was lucky to be out there with everyone, but she resented it at the same time. Why couldn’t things just be normal again?</p>
   <p>She was busy making sure the nurses and EMT had what they needed. They were really short on medical supplies. Tim, the EMT, had two really good full trauma kits and a few medium-sized first aid kits. Other people, including the Team, had small first aid kits. It would do for this one battle, but they’d be out of medical supplies for the next one.</p>
   <p>Oh, God, Lisa thought: a battle. This was horrible. There would be a next battle. Is this how life would be from now on? War and battles and shootings and amputations?</p>
   <p>Tim, the EMT, was talking to Dan when Dan motioned for Lisa to come over. Dan and Lisa had met at the Grange a few days earlier. “Doctor,” Dan said, “Tim and I were trying to make sure as many guards as possible have first aid kits. Tim will find out which ones have first aid training and get kits to them, but we need a field hospital. Do you have a preference on which building to use?”</p>
   <p>“My ER back in Olympia,” Lisa said. She realized that wasn’t a constructive comment, so she pointed to the volunteer fire station and said, “Well, I guess that will do.” It was made of cinder blocks and was partially shielded by a dirt berm. It would be “bullet resistant,” but not bullet proof.</p>
   <p>“That’s what I thought you’d say,” said Dan, who had already decided that’s where the field hospital would go. The fire station was crowded. That’s where people were eating and storing gear. Dan motioned for Ryan, who was nearby.</p>
   <p>“Ryan,” Dan said, “Take Dr. Matson and go clear out all the space she needs in the fire station for her field hospital. Obviously her use of space takes precedence over any others.” Ryan nodded and started running over to the fire station.</p>
   <p>Everything happened quickly, with a hustle at the gate as they were preparing for the attack. For the arrival of the gangs, or FC, or cops or whoever might be coming any minute.</p>
   <p>Truckloads of volunteer guards started showing up; mostly guys of varying ages, but some women, with hunting rifles. Some had pistols, too, and a few had shotguns. They had extra ammunition in plastic Target and Wal-Mart bags. Not exactly “tactical,” but effective.</p>
   <p>The next truck that drove up had a beautiful sight in the bed: a pallet of empty sandbags and a bunch of shovels. Perfect.</p>
   <p>“Where did you get those?” Grant asked the driver.</p>
   <p>“County DEM,” the driver said with a smile, referring to the Department of Emergency Management. “I volunteered for the floods every year and they put a pallet out at my place. Never thought I’d need them. Bet they stop bullets real good.”</p>
   <p>Grant realized that time was running out to fill and place the sandbags. He ran over to Dan and told him what was in the truck. Dan grinned. “Thank God,” he said.</p>
   <p>Dan started grabbing guys and telling them to get as many men as possible together to start filling sand bags. Luckily, the guy who brought the sandbags had a dozen or so orange traffic cones with the tips cut off. When they were tipped upside down, they worked perfectly as funnels for filling sandbags.</p>
   <p>Dan knew exactly where to place the sandbags. In a few minutes, the beginnings of sandbag bunkers started to appear; a crossfire directed at the gate and a series of bunkers toward the creek. Dan was loving this. He never thought he’d get to use his base-defense skills in the states. He wished he didn’t have to, but if he did, he was glad he knew what he was doing.</p>
   <p>Grant watched as the new arrivals were looking where to store their extra ammunition. He hastily decided to create an ammunition bank. He had no idea if this was how to do that, but today he was making up lots of stuff as he went along. He got someone to take all the loose ammunition—the plastic bags, the back packs, the boxes sitting in the fire station, everything that wasn’t in a magazine—and group them by caliber. Then everyone could get a few dozen rounds of what they needed. They might not get their own boxes of ammo back, but at least it would be organized and those who brought extra could get it to the people who needed it. Plus, it added a sense of organization to everything. Grant knew that a bunch of guys with hunting rifles would act like a bunch of guys with hunting rifles if this was unorganized like a hunting camp. But, if this were organized like a military operation—even an amateur one—then the men would act like it was a military operation. They needed to know that the people leading them were organized and knew what they were doing. Even if, in reality, they were just making stuff up.</p>
   <p>Pretty soon, a card table in the fire station had stacks of ammunition sorted by caliber. Grant was watching to see if people were hesitant to put their personal ammunition into the ammunition bank. They weren’t. People from the outside were about to attack them and try to kill them. They thought an ammunition bank was a great idea. They seemed to be willing to donate to the cause because the cause seemed to be run well.</p>
   <p>There was a lesson in all that, Grant thought. Show people that their contributions will be put to good use to solve their problems, and they’ll be willing to sacrifice for it. If they think their contributions will be wasted, they’ll hold onto what’s theirs.</p>
   <p>Grant saw the Team giving impromptu weapons classes to the brand new guards. They brought down all their extra rifles, like the AKs and tactical shotguns. Grant noticed that his two AK-74s and his A2 AR were among them. Good. A handful of guards had experience with ARs, including the one who now had Grant’s good old A2. The guys with ARs must be ex-military or law enforcement who were familiar with them.</p>
   <p>The Team was making sure everyone had extra magazines. Grant ran over and told them about the ammunition bank and suggested that they create a magazine bank and have a couple people loading magazines at the table. Scotty took all the Team’s extra magazines over to the table and grabbed a couple guys to start loading them and sorting the loaded mags by type.</p>
   <p>Grant yelled to Scotty, “Make sure you load the non-corrosive 5.45 for the AK-74s. I don’t want to forget to clean those AKs after all this and have rust.” It was weird what details people think of in situations like this. Scotty nodded. He was thinking the same thing about the corrosive 5.45 x 39 ammo. The corrosive salts in the primers of the surplus Russian 5.45 ammo could be cleaned off the gun with hot water or Windex, but if that wasn’t done, the gun would get a light coating of rust after about twenty-four hours. Knowing this, Grant had a few hundred rounds of non-corrosive 5.45 for just an occasion like this.</p>
   <p>Rich was overseeing all the guys with hunting rifles and shotguns. He motioned for Grant to come over.</p>
   <p>“Hey,” Rich asked Grant, “can you make sure the guys with shotguns have the appropriate ammo?”</p>
   <p>“Like slugs for the guys taking out vehicles and buckshot for the guys taking out people?” Grant asked with a smile.</p>
   <p>Rich smiled, too. “Well, yes, like that.” This Grant guy wasn’t too worthless. For a lawyer.</p>
   <p>“Way ahead of you, Rich,” Grant said with a smile. It was OK to enjoy this, wasn’t it? “We have an ammunition bank with ammo sorted by caliber, like slugs and buck shot for shotguns. You put the guys where you want them to be and I’ll make sure they have exactly the ammo they need.”</p>
   <p>“OK, sounds good,” said Rich. Wow. So much was coming together right then. He just hoped it was enough for what would hit them that night. Or maybe earlier.</p>
   <p>Not everything was going well, though. Grant was amazed by all the volunteers, most of whom seemed to know how to handle their weapons and follow directions. They were self-disciplined group. With one exception.</p>
   <p>Grant saw a teenage kid with a pistol out sideways gangster style. He was showing off to his friends. Then he waved it around, pointing it toward the guards and the fire station.</p>
   <p>Grant ran over to him and screamed, “What the hell are you doing?” That stunned the teenager. Grant, knowing that he needed to make an example out of this kid to keep discipline and order, yelled, “You think this is some rap video or video game? This isn’t play time, boy. This is your life and your neighbors’ lives. We ain’t playin’.”</p>
   <p>By this time, Dan came over. He was in command of the guards and needed to assert his authority, which was fine with Grant. Dan yelled, in his master sergeant voice, “Surrender your weapon, son. Now.”</p>
   <p>Dan held his hand out for the kid to put his pistol in. The kid was still stunned. He handed Dan the pistol—still pointing it in an unsafe direction, namely at Dan. Dan ejected the magazine, racked the slide to eject the round in the chamber, and handed the empty pistol to Grant.</p>
   <p>Dan glared at the teen and said in a low voice, “You’re done, son. Walk back home. Your pistol will be here for someone else to pick up for you. Don’t you ever do that again.”</p>
   <p>It was silent. Everyone got the picture. Yes, they were volunteers and the leaders didn’t insist on strict military discipline. There was no rank or “yes, sir” or “yes, sergeant,” but there was discipline. Do something stupid and you’re done.</p>
   <p>The teen was humiliated as he got his backpack and left. His head was down and he shuffled his feet. He started walking up the road all alone. He knew he’d be alone while everyone else got to be on guard duty for the big shoot out. All the others watched him as he walked away thinking “Glad that’s not me.”</p>
   <p>Grant thought back to George Washington’s writings on the Revolutionary War. A constant theme was the discipline of the troops. Washington faced the same situation Grant did: untrained volunteers. They couldn’t be disciplined like regular troops because they could just go home, but there had to be enough discipline for the untrained volunteers to be an effective fighting force.</p>
   <p>Grant thought that they were achieving that balance out there. Time would tell. Sending a boy home was one thing. What about when the troops tried to desert or stole some food? Do you shoot him? Shoot one of the residents you’re trying to protect? Hopefully they’d never confront that, but Grant knew they probably would.</p>
   <p>A truck came down the road from the Grange. It had the last load of volunteers and was picking up the Grange ladies to take them back. There was no need for grandmas to be in a firefight. Pastor Pete got out of the truck. He had a pistol. How appropriate. Grant was reminded of the saying from the Alamo: “Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.”</p>
   <p>The bustle went on for another hour or so. Everyone was running around doing things like getting the right ammo to everyone, setting up a field hospital, filling sandbags, and giving impromptu weapons lessons. The longer this went on, the more the initial excitement of pitching in was wearing off. People were watching the sandbag bunkers going up and realizing real bullets would be flying toward them. Real bullets. The field hospital was reassuring in one sense, but terrifying in another: people would be lying on those tables bleeding to death. Screaming. Dying.</p>
   <p>Volunteers who didn’t know much about guns were runners. They would resupply guards with ammunition and evacuate the wounded to the fire station, if necessary. They would run messages between points, including the snipers. The snipers had a radio, but it was impossible to predict when things wouldn’t work. Runners thought they weren’t doing the important work since they didn’t have rifles, when in fact the runners had perhaps the most dangerous job.</p>
   <p>Dan and Ryan were putting together squads. In the real military, a squad was usually ten men. Ten or so people were behind each of the two cross-fire sandbag bunkers. The snipers were another squad (although Grant never really saw them so he didn’t know how many there were). Ten or so more were split between the two sandbag bunkers guarding the flank by the river in case anyone came across there. This squad probably wouldn’t have direct contact so they were held in reserve. The medical team and Pastor Pete did their own thing; they weren’t in a squad. The fifteen or so runners were a squad. The squads were just groupings; they were not formal units. They were just a way to keep track of people and have them organized around tasks.</p>
   <p>The Team, which only had six, was another squad. The Team would be the dynamic, offensive unit that would attack, if needed. When they weren’t doing that, the Team would motivate the guards. And in preparation for all of this, they would train guards.</p>
   <p>Each squad had a squad leader. Rich picked them since he knew most of the guards. The exception was the Team; Rich didn’t pick that squad leader because everyone knew it was Pow. He was the tactical leader of the Team and Grant would just be a member of the Team.</p>
   <p>That’s when Grant realized that he’d never actually been in a gunfight with the Team. This would be their first one. He hoped they’d live up to their reputation.</p>

    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Seeing the Grange ladies going back reminded Grant about Chip at the Grange. Grant ran to the communications person, the “comm chick” as they called her. Her name was Heidi and she was in her late teens. She was a sheriff’s search and rescue volunteer and a radio geek. She had a ham radio—a nice one—and kept in contact with her dad, Curt Copeland, the ham radio guy. He was at his house with the massive ham radio antennas. They also kept in contact with Linda Rodriquez, the former Seattle police dispatcher who was the dispatcher at the comm center in the Grange. Between Heidi at the gate, Linda at the Grange, and Curt at his house, they had communications with everyone they needed to. They needed to have a CB and a ham radio, and sometimes both, and switch back and forth, but it was better than no comms.</p>
   <p>Grant asked Heidi, “Can you get me the Grange?”</p>
   <p>Heidi nodded. She handed Grant the ham radio. Good, Grant realized when he had a reasonably secure ham radio, what he had to say wasn’t something he wanted just anyone on a CB to hear. Linda answered.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Linda, this is Grant. Can you get me Chip?” Grant said, while Heidi was cringing at Grant’s improper use of radio lingo.</p>
   <p>Linda answered, “Hold on. I’ll get him.”</p>
   <p>About thirty seconds later, Chip came on. “Yah?”</p>
   <p>“Chip, it’s Grant. We’re geared up down at the gate pretty good. The Grange ladies are coming back to you. Here’s my question: You got enough beef watchin’ the snacks?”</p>
   <p>Chip laughed at Grant’s rather lame attempt to speak in code about the semi. “Yep,” Chip said. “Got five cows and me, the lead bull. Besides, the farmer has the keys.” That was pretty lame code talking, too.</p>
   <p>“What’s going on at the homestead?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Lots of people got the word,” Chip said. “They’re showing up. I screen out the ones that won’t be much help. One old fart came with his M1 Garand from Korea and wanted to fight. He’s one of the reserve cows. The strong young bulls, I send down to where you are. I let them know what’s going on down there. So, what is going on?”</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t want to say too much, even on the ham radio. “Things are fine down here,” he said. “‘Nuff said. See you in the morning,” Grant added, thinking silently, “Probably.”</p>
   <p>“You come back in the morning, Mr. Matson,” Chip said, “so I can say, ‘Mornin’ Sunshine.’”</p>
   <p>It was silent for a while. Chip didn’t want to lose any members of the new Pierce Point family.</p>
   <p>“Will do, Uncle Chip,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>He handed the radio back to Heidi. “How many handheld ham radios do we have?”</p>
   <p>“This one down here,” Heidi said, “one spare at the Grange, my dad has one, Linda has one at the Grange, and the Chief has one. The rest of the radios here are CBs. Rich, Dan, and the snipers have a CB. So do I, of course.”</p>
   <p>“Any extra CB handhelds?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Heidi said, “One. Who needs it?”</p>
   <p>“Pow,” Grant said. “I’ll take it to him.” Heidi got it, checked the battery level, and handed it to him.</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>As Grant was walking over to Pow, the CB crackled.</p>
   <p>“Visitors,” a voice said. Grant got a chill down his spine. That was exactly what he feared. Grant looked at the sky. It was still light out. It was late afternoon. It was a terrible time to try to attack, unless the attackers were furious and blood-thirsty. Why not wait until night?</p>
   <p>Rich and Dan yelled for the squad leaders to get their people ready. This was it.</p>
   <p>Dan had his dog team in hand and pointed at the gate. Anyone who walked across that bridge would be chewed to bits by those dogs. They were terrifying, which was half the point. The other half was actually chewing bad guys to bits.</p>
   <p>Grant ran toward the Team, which was gathering together behind one of the sandbag bunkers. He would be a foot soldier on the Team now that he’d done all that organizing. The Team looked at each other. They knew one another so well. They’d done this before. Not “this” exactly; not a gun fight. But, they’d done plenty else. It was time to prove themselves. They were up for it.</p>
   <p>A police car with its lights flashing was slowly coming down the road from Frederickson. It stopped, well short of the solid metal gate, and turned down Pierce Point Road. The car wasn’t about to try to drive across that bridge.</p>
   <p>The voice came back on the radio. “Just one vehicle. Lights on. No others. No one on foot. Yet.” Grant had never heard the voice before. It was a man. He sounded like he knew what he was doing.</p>
   <p>Rich was puzzled. Just one police car? That’s it. Either this is not the attack or it’s a trick. Something was up.</p>
   <p>Rich yelled, “No one shoots. No shooting unless your squad leader says so.” Squad leaders and others were repeating it to everyone around them so everyone got it.</p>
   <p>Rich was behind the other sandbag bunker. He got on his CB, turned the channel and said into the handheld, “Who are you?”</p>
   <p>“Sheriff’s Department,” the voice said. He was on CB channel 9, the emergency channel. “Who’s this?”</p>
   <p>Rich recognized the cop’s voice. It was John Bennington, a sergeant Rich had worked with. A good guy. “Is this John?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” Bennington said. “Is this Rich?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Rich said. “Hi, John. What brings you out to Pierce Point?” Rich asked calmly.</p>
   <p>“There’s been a report of a stolen truck. You know anything about that?” Bennington asked.</p>
   <p>“Nope,” Rich said. “I know about a truck that broke down a few hundred yards from the entrance. Some black guy came here this afternoon and said he needed help. We got his rig started up again and he drove it in here. Then he said he’s walking to town. He left a couple hours ago. We have the truck. You want to see it?”</p>
   <p>“You have it?” Bennington was surprised. “Really?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Rich said. “Want to see? I have the papers on the load that he left. If you walk slowly across the bridge, you won’t get shot. You see, we’re taking security into our own hands here, given all that’s happened. Your response times are a little long now. No offense.”</p>
   <p>“None taken,” Bennington said. “OK. Sgt. Summers is with me and he’ll stay in the car.”</p>
   <p>Sergeant Summers? Was that Dylan Summers, the young deputy? Rich asked, “Did you say Sgt. Summers?”</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Bennington said. “Lots of promotions lately with all the AWOL people. I’m a lieutenant, myself.”</p>
   <p>“Congratulations,” Rich said. So this is how they were getting guys to keep manning the patrol cars: promotions. Great. But John was a decent guy, so unless he’d radically changed in the last few weeks, he probably hadn’t let it go to his head.</p>
   <p>“Coming out,” Bennington said.</p>
   <p>Rich yelled to the squads, “Hold your fire. I repeat: do <emphasis>not</emphasis> fire.”</p>
   <p>People were tense. When most of the guards heard the car door open and shut, they started gripping their guns hard. Grant found himself scanning the river and the flanks. Just one cop car at the gate wasn’t the attacking force. It must be coming from some other direction. Grant was scanning right, left, and to the rear. So was the Team.</p>
   <p>Bennington walked slowly with his hands to his sides. He made it to the gate and motioned that he wanted to go under the metal pole and come across. Rich gave him the thumbs up. Bennington scrunched down under the metal pole and crossed over. Rich came out from his sandbag bunker and strolled over with extreme calm and confidence. After all, he was just talking to an old friend. It wasn’t like they had anything to hide.</p>
   <p>Bennington was marveling at all the defenses. He especially noted Dan’s K9 team. He would make a report to headquarters on this. His initial impression was: Don’t fuck with Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Rich had some papers in his hand and showed them to Bennington. “As far as I can tell from these,” Rich said, “that trailer is empty. A return run from Tacoma from a few days ago. That’s what the black guy said.”</p>
   <p>Bennington asked, “Mind if I look in there?”</p>
   <p>“Of course not,” Rich said. “Let me get the keys.” Smithson had previously given Rich the keys to his empty trailer.</p>
   <p>Rich pointed toward his pants pocket to let Bennington know that he would be getting the keys out of his pocket instead of drawing a pistol on him. Bennington nodded.</p>
   <p>Rich got the keys out of his pocket and took Bennington over to the truck, which was in plain sight. Rich unlocked the padlocks and opened the trailer door.</p>
   <p>“See,” Rich said. “Empty. It’s probably why he just abandoned this. He probably went to the gate at Frederickson. He was headed that direction, toward town,” Rich said, pointing toward Frederickson.</p>
   <p>Bennington was stunned. He was surprised not only that Rich had let him cross the bridge, but that the truck was empty. Bennington had been told by the county emergency management people that the truck—and the truck Rich that was showing him matched the description he’d been given—was full of something valuable that they wanted back in Frederickson. But the emergency management people and the FC idiots from Olympia were dumbshits, Bennington thought. This confirmed it. They had Bennington chasing after empty trucks.</p>
   <p>“OK, that’s empty alright,” Bennington said. “The Commissioner will be disappointed.”</p>
   <p>“The Commissioner?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah, Commissioner Winters,” Bennington said, referring to one of the county commissioners. “He is kind of running things now.” Bennington rolled his eyes. Bennington hated Winters. Winters was corrupt.</p>
   <p>“As in, running things with gangs?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>Bennington smiled, “Well, that’s the rumor, but you can never believe all that.” Bennington was communicating loud and clear.</p>
   <p>Bennington pointed to his pocket and said, “Mind if I take a picture for the Commissioner?”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Rich said. Bennington pulled his cell phone out of his pocket and took a few pictures.</p>
   <p>“Well,” Bennington said, “thanks for letting me see the truck. You can keep it. It’s worthless now. Just another truck without any diesel. How’s the family?” He asked.</p>
   <p>Rich and Bennington talked about their families for a minute or two. Bennington’s wife had recently left him and took their daughter with her to Mill Creek, a suburb north of Seattle. Bennington constantly worried about his daughter up there in Seattle with all that was going on. He knew he couldn’t get up to her now or maybe ever.</p>
   <p>When they were done catching up on family news, Rich said, “Oh, hey, John, I have something for you.” He ran over to the fire station and returned with a paper bag that he handed to Bennington.</p>
   <p>Bennington knew what it was without opening it—a bottle of booze. Bennington wouldn’t open it up in front of all those witnesses. He smiled and said, “Oh, thanks. You didn’t have to.”</p>
   <p>Rich smiled. He knew what was going on. Grant, who was watching from behind a sandbag bunker, sensed that this happened all the time at the Sheriff’s department, which was probably why Rich left the force. Only it probably wasn’t a bottle of booze between two old friends that got Rich to leave.</p>
   <p>“Take care,” Bennington said as he was walking back across the bridge with the bag in his hand. “Let me know if you need anything out here, but it looks like you guys are taking care of yourselves.” That was exactly what Rich hoped Bennington would conclude. Pierce Point was taking care of itself and not messing with the authorities—that’s what Winters would hear from Bennington. Good.</p>
   <p>Bennington got in the car and it slowly backed down the road to the Frederickson road and drove off.</p>
   <p>When the car was gone, Rich looked at the guards and Team and yelled, “That’s how we do it at Pierce Point!”</p>
   <p>Cheers went up all around. They wouldn’t have to fight. Probably not. Well, not tonight.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “I want you guys to stay here until morning. I’m not letting our guard down. We’re here, we’re fed, and we might as well finish this job. Maybe people at the county are mad at Bennington for coming back with a picture of an empty trailer. We’ll see. But stick around.” People were so happy that there wasn’t a gunfight that they didn’t mind staying there all night. None of them wanted to be a coward and leave. They enjoyed the camaraderie of just being there and were ready to fight for their homes and families.</p>
   <p>People came up to Rich to congratulate him. That bribery at the end was a nice touch. They knew they’d have fewer problems with the cops now.</p>
   <p>Grant went into the volunteer fire station to see Lisa. She had heard that there probably wasn’t going to be a fight and was relieved. It was anti-climactic, but in a good way.</p>
   <p>Grant couldn’t help himself. “You know, honey, the idea for the empty trailer was mine.”</p>
   <p>She just nodded. She was very proud of him, but couldn’t let him know. He was obnoxious enough now; he’d be worse if she actually acknowledged how smart that stunt was.</p>
   <p>“Uh huh. Nice,” is all she said. But Grant knew that she was proud and glad. Or at least, he thought she was.</p>
   <p>After a while, Rich came over to Grant and said, “Hey, nice head fake. That was brilliant.”</p>
   <p>Grant was proud. “Well,” he said, “we got lucky that Smithson had that extra trailer with the paper work.” Grant paused and then said, “You know, Rich, the best part about outsmarting those bastards is that you don’t have that ringing in your ears from, you know… shooting them.”</p>
   <p>“And them shooting back,” Rich said.</p>

    <p>Chapter 122</p>
    <p><emphasis>Aftermath of False Attack</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 12)</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was a great night down at the gate with the euphoria from the evening’s events lingering in the air. Most of the guards realized now that they were probably not prepared for a full-on battle for the gate. What had been casual guard duty, hanging out with friends and carrying around rifles was now far more serious. Each person down at the gate had played through his or her mind “what if 100 gang bangers had tried to come through the gate?”</p>
   <p>Good. They needed to have a reality check, especially one that didn’t involve any actual shooting. Rich, Dan, and Grant talked about how important it had been for people to think this through. To think about how serious the threat was and how much work it took to prevent the slaughter of them and their families. People needed to understand exactly why they were fighting in order to fight hard. They understood now.</p>
   <p>Rich, Dan, and Grant used that night to finish organizing the defenses. Dan talked to squads about what they would do in the case of an attack. How they would get more ammo from a runner. How they would get the wounded to the fire station. How they would communicate with other squads. How they would treat prisoners. Grant was just listening to Dan because he had no idea how to do these things. Rich was listening to Dan, too.</p>
   <p>One thing Grant hadn’t known about was the hidden observer who had radioed in “visitors.” Grant asked Dan about that, and he pulled Grant away from the crowd. Dan whispered, “I don’t want anyone except you and Rich, and maybe the Team, to know about our sniper. I don’t want the guards to be talking and compromising him. I’ll introduce you to him later, if he comes back across the gate, but he’s Sniper Mike. Mike Graggola. Iraq and Afghanistan. Army scout and marksman. He didn’t go to sniper school, but he’s a great sniper.”</p>
   <p>Dan pointed across the river, on the other side of the gate. “He’s out there. Somewhere. He lives across the gate in that house,” Dan pointed to a house on the other side of the road to Frederickson. “I know his dad. His parents are in Pierce Point now so they’re safe. But Mike is free rangin’ over there. With a handheld CB. He has a night vision scope. One of the ones that is commercially available for hunting.”</p>
   <p>Dan looked troubled. “He got pretty messed up in the sandbox,” meaning Iraq and Afghanistan. “Mike has PTSD and likes to be in the woods alone. He’s not dangerous or anything. In fact, he’s a great kid. Quiet and polite. But he said that when he got back, he couldn’t shake the feeling that people were watching him. He knew it wasn’t true, but he had been watched for so long by people trying to kill him that he got used to it. He had seemed to be improving, but then this crisis or whatever it is happened and now he’s back in a combat role. Exactly what he didn’t need.”</p>
   <p>Dan looked over toward Sniper Mike’s probable location and said, “Damn. I hate war. Really, I do. It’s what I did for a living—and what it looks like I’m doing now. But I hate it. I remember when Mike was a teenager, out driving too fast and trying to make out with girls. That wasn’t that long ago. Now he feels like people are watching him, even though he knows they’re not. He feels like there’s something weak about him for having PTSD. Of course, it’s not weakness. It’s what the brain does when you’re in a shitty situation for a couple tours like Mike was.”</p>
   <p>Dan looked down and kicked a rock with his combat boots. “I hope he can come out of this.” Dan looked up at the gate and all the guards. “But I doubt what’s going on now will help him. People are still trying to kill him, it’s just that it’s the cops or gangs or whatever now. Maybe not right now, but they’ll be back and would love to snuff out our forward observer. He’s all alone over there. He’s got a sniper rifle with that night vision. He’s got a bunch of guns to take care of himself and food and water at his house. But he’s out in the woods all the time. Poor guy.” Dan just stared over at Mike’s house and then walked away. He had nothing else to say. In fact, talking about how Sniper Mike had come home to a war <emphasis>here</emphasis> depressed Dan.</p>
   <p>All the leaders were doing their best to keep everyone’s readiness high. No relaxing. A convoy of police, FC, gangs—or a combination of all three—could make a run across that bridge at any moment.</p>
   <p>People were getting tired late into the evening. Squad leaders asked if people could nap in shifts. Everyone looked at Dan. “Sure, half at one time. Two hour naps.”</p>
   <p>Grant took a nap himself. Around dark, a truck came from the Grange with blankets. It was mid-May, so it got down to about 60 degrees at night. Not terrible, but not exactly warm, either. Grant found a piece of dirt and borrowed a blanket. The ground was hard, but he was so tired he was out cold. Someone woke him up in the middle of the night. Surprisingly, he was nearly refreshed. Grant got a caffeine pill from his front pocket. In a few minutes, things were fine again.</p>
   <p>It was quiet that night. He could hear the guards talking, and overheard the most amazing conversations. People—usually people who had never really talked to each other before—were talking about their lives, their dreams, their fears. They were talking about stupid stuff, too, like which young starlet in the movies was hotter. These people who never really knew each other before all this were bonding. The group was getting tight fast.</p>
   <p>You know, Grant thought to himself, maybe the scare of the gangs or cops or whatever coming for the semi was actually a blessing in disguise. It got the guards organized. It got the sandbags put up. It got lots of volunteers down here. It got people to bond. It’s amazing how different a situation can seem a few hours later. Grant had gone from expecting a bloody fight, and maybe even dying, to seeing the whole thing as a positive experience.</p>
   <p>He went to see Lisa. She was still down at the volunteer fire station in case there was a night attack. He was trying not to hang around her too much because it would look bad. Everyone else was supposed to stay alert but he, a leader, was chatting with his wife? That would not be a good example.</p>
   <p>Grant came in a couple times to see her and explained the whole role model thing about why he wasn’t going to be hanging out in the fire station with her. She seemed to understand.</p>
   <p>Lisa didn’t say it, because it wouldn’t change anything if she did, but she really wanted him to be with her. As much as she thought he was a gun-toting hillbilly wild man, she felt safe around him, especially with all this going on. She noticed that Grant seemed more confident and fearless than most others. What she didn’t know was that Grant had been around guns so much and had people shooting right next to him on the range during training with the Team that this didn’t faze him. Not as much, at least. He was still scared, but not terrified. He knew that most amateurs were such bad shots that a guy shooting at him was likely to miss him. Even close in, most bad guys would be terrible shots. Most cops only shot fifty rounds a year to re-qualify on their pistols; Grant had seen them on the law enforcement range the Team practiced on. Gang bangers were even worse shots. They pointed their guns sideways and cared more about how they looked with a gun than actually hitting a target. Besides, Grant had the confidence of knowing that in a fight he’d react the right way, not run. Back in Olympia when looters were attacking Ron, Grant had driven straight for them, got out, started shooting, and hit them very efficiently, without even thinking. He knew he’d react the same way in the next fight. That created confidence.</p>
   <p>Grant’s calm and confidence was exactly what Lisa needed. She wanted him to be in the safe volunteer fire station with her. But she was watching everything that he was doing and had to admit that he needed to be doing all that. Organizing, motivating, training. Leading. She was proud of him, but she just wished he could excel at something else, like being a lawyer in a nice subdivision without gangs and food shortages. With law and order and a prosperous economy. She wanted the old days back. Most of her thoughts kept coming back to that. She desperately wanted “normal” back.</p>
   <p>Finally, the break of dawn came. It was such an awesome sight. Now Grant understood the phrase, “Pray for dawn.” It meant there wouldn’t be a fight that night. People were now thoroughly restless. It was obvious an attack wasn’t coming right now.</p>
   <p>Or was it? Dan reminded people that dawn is one of the most likely times for an attack. Defenders are tired from being up all night and that crack of light helps attackers see. Motivating people was getting harder and harder the longer they were there in a constant state of readiness.</p>
   <p>The sun was finally up all the way, and it was morning. People were really tired now. Quite a few fell asleep right where they were. The two-hour nap thing kind of broke down.</p>
   <p>Dan and Rich motioned for Grant to come over. “I think it’s time to let half of them go back,” Dan said. “What do you guys think?”</p>
   <p>Grant looked at Rich. He was glad to be included in leadership decisions like this, but was very conscious that he had no military or law enforcement training. Grant was trying very hard not to overstep the authority he had earned.</p>
   <p>Rich took the cue. He appreciated that Grant was focusing on political and organizational things instead of trying to be the big boss, especially on military matters. “Oh, yeah,” Rich said, “we need to get them back. They’ll just fall asleep on us and our command authority will be lost.” Grant just nodded. He was thinking the same thing.</p>
   <p>Dan said, “Rich, half of each squad can go? Sound good?”</p>
   <p>Rich nodded.</p>
   <p>“I’ll get some trucks down here,” Grant said. He went to Heidi, who was asleep, and had her radio Chip to send down several trucks. It was the CB, which was not secure, so Grant didn’t say, “Come pick up half our guards.”</p>
   <p>People were getting hungry, too. It had been a long night. Grant told Chip to have the Grange ladies cook up a big-ass breakfast.</p>
   <p>“Way ahead of you, Grant,” Chip said on the CB. “I’m smelling hash browns as we speak. Mmmm.” Hash browns sounded so good right now. Extremely, mind-blowingly good.</p>
   <p>Grant asked Rich and Dan, “How does a 7:00 p.m. Grange meeting sound?” That would give both halves of the guards a chance to take a nap. “I’d like,” Grant continued, “to tell everyone about the semi of food and my plan for distribution. Well, actually for not distributing it now. We need to talk about the weaknesses we learned from this. Like an alert system, a transportation system, and anything else I’m forgetting. I want a quick vote on the semi situation because we have the glow of victory right now. I want to use that to get my plan for waiting until winter to distribute the food voted on. Any objections?”</p>
   <p>Rich and Dan shook their heads. Sounded good to them.</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant was tired. Again. He managed to stay awake to work on the transition of half the guards back to their homes. He made sure only half of a squad was left. He encouraged people to leave the ammo they brought, but wouldn’t stop anyone from taking theirs back. Only a few reclaimed their ammo. No one reclaimed their mags from the magazine bank. That was a good sign.</p>
   <p>Lisa and the medical team were some of the first to go back. They were tired and would have things to do at the Grange. Lisa smiled at Grant and said, “See you back at the ranch.” She seemed to be holding up well, given how different last night had been from anything she’d ever experienced. Or ever imagined.</p>
   <p>Everyone was hungry. Staying up all night burned a lot of calories, especially for Grant who was constantly walking around and directing things. He realized that they needed to have meals on hand next time. The Grange ladies could get out of the danger zone, but they needed to have meals to leave behind. Lesson learned. No one would die from being hungry for breakfast. But the next full alert situation could last several days. They would come up with a plan.</p>
   <p>Grant was finally done with the wrap-up. He got on a truck with half the Team, Bobby and Scotty, and rode up to the Grange. Bobby and Scotty were quiet, unlike most truck rides where they were jovial. They were dog-ass tired.</p>
   <p>There were a lot of people at the Grange. Many of the guards who had been at the gate and come back a few hours before were still there. The Grange was becoming a community hang out. The guards were telling and retelling stories to the residents.</p>
   <p>When Grant walked in, some people started cheering. Someone yelled, “Nice head fake, Grant.” That made him smile.</p>
   <p>But what really made him smile was the smell of hash browns. And, he couldn’t believe it, bacon and sausage? The Grange ladies had some of those big silver serving containers with the can of sterno burning at the bottom, like at a hotel buffet. Wow. It was the best breakfast he’d ever had.</p>
   <p>Grant didn’t want to be a hog, but he made three trips through. He felt better and better with each plate. So did everyone else. He went back into the kitchen to thank the ladies and get to know them.</p>
   <p>“Where’s all this food coming from?” he asked. The logistics and organization guy in him couldn’t help asking.</p>
   <p>“Well,” one of the ladies said, “we’ve been asking our neighbors for things. We got a bunch of frozen sausage and even some bacon. Eggs are running thin, but we got some from the Meyers who have a bunch of hens out on Frog Lake Road.”</p>
   <p>Another lady, Janet, said, “People are just bringing food to us here. It’s kind of nice to see.” Grant knew this wouldn’t last long. People would start to keep the food for themselves as things got tighter. But for right now, it was great.</p>
   <p>There was something about working for the community and then having the community supply food in return. It reminded Grant of high school when he’d go sandbagging during a flood and the community would feed the volunteers. It wasn’t like working for money. There was something more personal and gratifying about having someone make him a meal than just the food on the plate. Grant felt like this is how things were supposed be. Not that people were supposed to have the collective feed them. But that people, who would normally rely on themselves and their families, would share a meal with those who were helping them. Grant realized that this is how most of the world operated and always had. Community. Not the collective, but a genuine community of people voluntarily helping each other. Voluntarily. With no government telling them they had to.</p>
   <p>Grant checked in with Chip and got a report that not much was happening. Things were quiet. He found out that the beach patrol was on full alert last night and into the morning. No one tried to come in that way. Grant had nearly forgotten about the beach.</p>
   <p>Mark was there. “Wanna a ride back home?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep.” That was all Grant had the energy to muster. That couple pounds of food he’d just eaten was putting him to sleep. Bobby, Scotty, Wes, and Pow piled in the back of the truck. They were lying down in the bed of the truck. They were beat.</p>
   <p>On the way back, Mark told Grant about how he and John were doing on hunting. “Scouted out some pretty decent spots. Saw some signs of deer. We should have some fresh meat soon.”</p>
   <p>Good. Grant wondered if the deer would get hunted out quickly given that everyone was out hunting now. The electricity was still on so they could freeze the meat. They’d have to keep moving farther back into the woods to find game. At least they had hunting grounds, even if they would get thinner and thinner.</p>
   <p>This got Grant thinking. They needed to start a crash gardening program. He suspected that people were already doing this, but he’d bring it up at the meeting that night in case any community-wide coordination was needed. Like a seed bank. He chuckled to himself. The money banks were closed, but people were starting seed and ammo banks. How appropriate.</p>
   <p>The next thing he knew, he was waking up as they pulled onto the gravel of Over Road. He was surprised that he fell asleep so quickly. There was Paul guarding. He looked tired, too. He must have been on beach patrol all night and now was on guard duty. They needed an extra guard for Over Road. Grant had an idea, but it could wait, he couldn’t stay awake. He walked into the cabin and saw the kids there. They were so happy to see him. They had known that something was happening last night, but they had also heard that their dad would be coming home.</p>
   <p>“What did you guys do yesterday?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Manda said, “Our chores.”</p>
   <p>That sounded so weird. Two weeks ago, Manda had no “chores.” Suburban kids simply didn’t do chores. It was hard enough to get her to put her dishes in the dishwasher. Now she was cheerfully doing “chores.”</p>
   <p>“Like what?” Grant asked, already knowing the answer.</p>
   <p>“Cleaning up the kitchen,” Manda said. “I’m watching Missy, too. She’s a nice kid. Let’s see. I’m helping Grandma with whatever she needs. We folded laundry with her when she was doing laundry over at the Morrells. Helped with dinner. I read stories to Cole last night for bed time.” Manda was a busy kid out there. Good.</p>
   <p>“Stories? Where’d you get the books?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Mrs. Morrell has some,” Manda said. “She’s a teacher, you know. Her grandkids used to come out here so she had things for them to do.”</p>
   <p>“Cole, are you having fun out at the cabin?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes. I play with Sissy lots.” That was Cole’s nickname for his sister. It was a term of endearment. He loved his Sissy so much.</p>
   <p>Then Cole made Grant’s entire day. Cole asked, “What did you do today, Dad?” Cole didn’t talk a lot, so when he asked a question like that, it was a big deal.</p>
   <p>“Oh, thanks for asking little buddy,” Grant said. “Well, Dad helped the neighbors with things. I went down and,” Grant was about to say “was a soldier” but that would scare Cole. So he said, “helped the police keep bad people out. We did a good job. No bad people came. I had to do that all night so I couldn’t tuck you in last night. Sorry, little buddy.”</p>
   <p>“That’s OK, Dad,” Cole said. “You had to keep the bad people out. That was a good thing for you to do.” That was one of his longer sentences in quite some time. He was doing better with his talking out there. Grant wondered if all the stress of suburban life—going to school, running around on errands all over town, distractions like video games and other things—had been tiring him out. He seemed more rested and relaxed out there. It was weird: a cabin in the middle of the Collapse might actually be less stressful and tiring than modern suburban life, at least for Cole. He was shielded from the stress of the Collapse. He didn’t know about the gangs. He didn’t worry about how they would get food. He was on a summer vacation with his family.</p>
   <p>Grant realized that Manda was alone with Cole and Missy most of the day. They were partially safe on Over Road, but sometimes there probably wasn’t a guard at the shack. And anyone could come along the beach and up the stairs to the cabin. Plus, the kids were roaming all over playing and delivering messages for people. They were unarmed.</p>
   <p>Arming kids? Really? Grant thought. Yes. Really, he answered himself.</p>
   <p>“Hey Manda,” Grant said as he motioned for her to come over to him. He whispered, “Don’t tell your Mom.” This always meant something cool was about to happen. “You remember my Glock 27?”</p>
   <p>Manda’s eyes got big. “Oh, yeah. The little Glock in .40 caliber?” Grant let her shoot a lot before the Collapse. She was pretty good with it. Most people would say her small hands couldn’t handle the recoil of a .40 in a subcompact pistol. They would be wrong. She handled it very well.</p>
   <p>“I want you to carry it when you’re outside,” Grant said. “I have a pocket holster for you. Don’t carry it without a pocket holster. I don’t want anything to get in the trigger guard, like keys, and have it go off. Carry it in your pocket, maybe like a cargo pocket on some shorts. It probably won’t fit in your pants pocket,” Grant noted this because kids’ clothes usually had small pockets, “but it will fit in a cargo pocket.”</p>
   <p>He didn’t tell Manda, but he had started to carry his little tiny LCP in .380 auto in his pocket at all times. So if someone disarmed him of his carbine and pistol in his holster, he’d still have a gun. Hidden, which was why he didn’t tell a soul about it. The only thing to make up for the mild power of a .380 auto was the element of surprise.</p>
   <p>“How do I keep it away from Mom?” Manda asked.</p>
   <p>“She’ll be working most of the time,” Grant said. “I’ll keep it in my nightstand. She’ll think it’s for me. You can grab it in the morning and put it in the nightstand at night. There’ll be an extra magazine there, too. Take it with you. You can put it in your pants pocket. This will be the good self-defense ammo so don’t do any target shooting with those rounds. Get some .40 ball from me for that.” “Ball” referred to basic full metal jacket ammunition, which was nothing special; just a copper-coated hunk of lead that flew through the air.</p>
   <p>Grant thought of one more thing; an important thing. “Oh, and don’t let Grandma know either,” Grant said. “In fact, don’t let anyone know. You never tell people you’re carrying concealed. You need that element of surprise to take down a bad guy.”</p>
   <p>“No warning shots,” Manda said, very plainly. “That’s what you told me a while ago.”</p>
   <p>Grant was proud. He didn’t want his nice, bubbly sixteen year-old daughter to kill anyone, but he wanted her to be the one to come home from the fight, not the other guy. Or guys. That’s why she had two ten-round magazines. Bad guys usually travel in packs.</p>
   <p>“That’s right,” Grant said. “Warning shots are only on TV. Only amateurs give warning shots. There’s not exactly any prosecutions going on now so there’s no reason to show people—like the person attacking you or a prosecutor—how reasonable and nice you are. Show the guy attacking you how deadly you are. How much of a mistake it was to pick on you. And if anyone tries to hurt your brother, kill them for me. Kill them dead.” Manda could tell her dad was serious. “Kill them dead,” Grant repeated.</p>
   <p>Manda nodded. “Two to the chest and one to the head,” she said, repeating what Grant had told her on the range. She was a combination of sweet girl and a well-trained potential killer. Just what she needed to be in times like this.</p>
   <p>“Daddy, what’s it like to shoot people?” she asked quietly. Grant could tell she was scared about having to shoot someone.</p>
   <p>Horrible. That was the answer. But Grant couldn’t say that because it might scare her into not acting when her life depended on it.</p>
   <p>“What’s it like to shoot someone?” Grant said. “A relief. A relief that they didn’t kill me or Ron back home. Those men,” or boys, Grant couldn’t really see them that night, “wanted to kill me and Ron and who knows how many others. You know, I have two main thoughts about what I had to do that night. First, those men shouldn’t have been there, coming at me and Ron with guns. They should have been at home not trying to hurt people. Second, I saved lives that night. That’s a good thing, even if you have to do nasty things to get it done.”</p>
   <p>Grant paused. He had another thought. “You know something else about that night? I didn’t even hear my gun going off. Before that night, I had thought that it would be loud without hearing protection, but I don’t even remember hearing a thing. I was so focused on stopping those guys.” Grant thought it would be good for Manda to not worry about hearing loss at a time when someone was trying to kill her.</p>
   <p>She nodded, relieved.</p>
   <p>Grant needed to get some sleep. “Honey, can you make sure things are quiet in the cabin while I sleep?” He pointed to the master bedroom, the one bedroom with a door that closed.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Manda said. “Can we talk some more about stuff?”</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Grant said, happy that his teenager wanted to talk to him. “Anytime. In fact, I want to try to take tomorrow off. What about then?”</p>
   <p>“Sure. Nighty night, Daddy,” Manda said, just like she did when she was little.</p>
   <p>That reminded Grant of the old days. He remembered taking Manda’s favorite stuffed animal—a pink bear—to her at kindergarten when she’d forgotten it. He remembered her seventh birthday at Chuck E. Cheese. What a dump that place was. All the kids who ate the pizza there ended up throwing up. He remembered going for ice cream in the summer and that Manda always ordered mint chocolate chip, just like her mom.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at the bed. It seemed so inviting. As he took off his pistol belt, he started thinking about how his old life seemed a million miles away. An entire lifetime ago; someone else’s life. Remembering things from his old life seemed like he was watching a movie. It wasn’t his life, but he could see the events. He couldn’t believe that the guy who he remembered dropping off the bear, taking kids to a birthday party, and getting ice cream was the same guy who had been up all night with an AR-15, had basically stolen a semi load of food, was wanted by the government, and… had killed three people. That guy. Was he really the same guy as the one who dropped off the pink teddy bear at Chuck E. Cheese?</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Jeanie woke up feeling lucky. She felt lucky to be in a protected place like Camp Murray with the walls, barbed wire, and troops. The power was always on and the internet always worked. They had medics and a full hospital there. She felt especially lucky to be able to eat all the fabulous food she wanted in the cafeteria, and she had a great meal every time, complete with linen napkins and real silverware. Her boyfriend, Jim, was pretty safe, too, in his National Guard unit. They had security and plenty to eat. Given what she knew from the briefings they were getting, they were very fortunate to be so well taken care of.</p>
   <p>Jeanie had been struggling with guilt for the past few days. She was bothered by the guilt of knowing that she had scrumptious meals and was totally safe while the rest of the people were…she couldn’t really finish that sentence in her mind. The regular people were suffering in varying degrees. Some were doing OK, especially in Seattle, at least the nice neighborhoods that didn’t have looting. Others were struggling with periodic empty shelves in the stores and worrying about feeding their kids. Others, especially out in the sticks, were on their own. God only knew how they were doing. The economy was destroyed. No one was working, at least in the private sector, but with the government nationalizing everything there really wasn’t a “private sector” anymore. Crime was out of control.</p>
   <p>The second reason why Jeanie had been feeling guilty was that some of her friends were now wanted by the government. Especially Grant Matson. He was on the POI list, as were all the Washington Association of Business guys she knew. She’d been to their houses, drank beer with them, knew their kids. Now those guys were wanted. She used to think like they did, believing in limited government, and now she was a government employee actively working to keep the government in operation. She had become one of “them”: a government insider who had it way better than regular people.</p>
   <p>Last night she had thought about the guilt, slept on it, and woke up realizing she was lucky. She was taken care of and she wasn’t about to be arrested. Survival is all about taking care of yourself, she thought. She also thought that she was doing a damned good job of it. It wasn’t her fault that she was in such good shape compared to the rest of the people. Lucky. She was lucky, she kept telling herself.</p>
   <p>She checked the headlines on her laptop before the 7:00 a.m. briefing. Two of the stories she worked on were on the news. The first had her quoted as a “high level state official” and was about how the rumors of the federal government sending even more help to Washington State were true. Well, that’s what Jeanie had been told, so she told the reporter it was true. The second story featured video of her explaining how the strict federal anti-fraud measures in place for the FCards worked and how people were cooperating to make sure their neighbors got enough. She doubted that was true, but, hey, this was her job.</p>
   <p>She loved being on camera. She was beautiful, energetic, and enthusiastic. And, since she worked for the “Republican” State Auditor Rick Menlow, the Governor’s Office loved to put her on camera. It reinforced their message that the Crisis was “no time for politics” and “we’re all in this together.”</p>
   <p>The Democrats running Washington State were already getting ready to let Menlow win the next gubernatorial election. (If they could even administer an election given the Crisis; whether to have the election was still being debated.) The Democrats knew that Menlow would govern exactly as they had and they could still blame everything that went wrong on the Republicans. Perfect. Jeanie knew she, and especially Menlow, were being used, but given the alternative of trying to live outside Camp Murray with the shortages, crime, and fear, it was a good trade.</p>
   <p>The briefing started on time, as usual. Camp Murray was full of military people and after about a day, there was a military atmosphere. Things were on time. Everyone said “sir” or “ma’am” to each other. People stood at attention when the Governor walked in the room. That kind of thing.</p>
   <p>Menlow came to this briefing. He usually didn’t attend these morning meetings. In fact, Jeanie had no idea what her boss did all day long. She just did her job and assumed he was doing his. Although, there really wasn’t much auditing happening these days. Almost all the staff of the State Auditor’s Office were either laid off or had just stopped showing up to work. Jeanie figured that Menlow was basically being the Governor’s understudy. He would attend the meetings with the Governor, see what she did, and meet people he would be working with when he was the Governor. He probably was meeting with senior National Guard brass to learn the most important part of the job of being Governor during the Crisis: Commander in Chief of the Guard. Of course, almost all the Guard units had been federalized, and therefore were under federal command. But, the public expected the Governor to appear to be tirelessly working to coordinate the relief efforts. So the “Commander in Chief” thing was constantly pitched to the media. They ate it up and faithfully regurgitated it back to the public.</p>
   <p>Her boss looked tired, but otherwise OK. He was carrying himself like the next Governor, not the fifth-in-line-of-succession State Auditor. He had his own security detail. He loved it.</p>
   <p>“Good morning, Jeanie,” Menlow said to her when he came into the conference room. “Haven’t seen you in a while.”</p>
   <p>“How are you, sir?” she asked, finding it odd that she just called her boss “sir” but it seemed to fit in perfectly under the circumstances.</p>
   <p>“Fine, but we have lots of work to do,” he said and sat down for his briefing. He seemed to be distant from her. Like he was above her. Not arrogant, but above her. She chalked it up to him being wrapped up in everything; preoccupied, perhaps. Jeanie didn’t care much. She was safe at Camp Murray so her boss could be a little distant to her. Whatever.</p>
   <p>Jason started the briefing with a wrap-up of the overnight news. The President would be making a speech tonight about “unity.” This was because several of the southern and mountain western states had announced that they would “opt out” of the federal government. The opt-out didn’t surprise anyone because the southern states had been talking about it for a while. Overnight, the Feds said that even more power outages had hit the Northeast. They had gone down in frequency the past two weeks, but were back. The Feds were getting a handle on it, but the problem wasn’t over. The attacks were still coming from China, but now also out of Russia and Brazil, of all places.</p>
   <p>A few high-ranking generals had publicly announced that they fully supported the President and would start to court martial Oath Keepers who did not take a new oath. The new oath military people were being required to swear to was to the President and not to the Constitution like with the old oath. The old oath was the one spelled out in the Constitution and had been used since then.</p>
   <p>None of the civilians in the room understood the significance of the new oath. Most people already assumed that the military took some oath to follow the Commander in Chief. The military people in the room understood the significance of the change of the oath. But they didn’t say anything. If they were Oath Keepers they wouldn’t be in this room at Camp Murray, where personnel had been screened for loyalty to the current government—to the President, that is.</p>
   <p>“FCards are working pretty well,” Jason said. He reported that almost 50% of the country had one and that riots and looting for food were down dramatically. The corporate mega farms were starting to get food directly to the Feds for distribution. There were plenty of problems still, but given that no one expected it to work at all, the moderate level of success exceeded their expectations. Mediocrity was good enough right now.</p>
   <p>Someone asked about food getting out to people, “How is this possible?” A fair question.</p>
   <p>“For a few years now, America has been a net importer of food,” Jason said. That stunned Jeanie. America—“amber waves of grain”—that fed the world was now importing more food that it was exporting? How was that possible? “Well, needless to say we’re not exporting anymore food right now. Most of the food imports were luxury foods like fresh fruits and vegetables and there’s not a huge market for those.” Gardening in the U.S. would supply those foods now. “So we’re doing a decent job of channeling all that grain and livestock to ourselves. Luckily for us, almost all of the agricultural production is done by the large companies friendly to us that we have nationalized.” The government could never commandeer millions of small farmers, but getting a couple of giant corporations to play ball was easy.</p>
   <p>“One other reason,” Jason said, “we’re feeding people pretty well is that before the Crisis, we wasted an astounding amount of food. Food that wasn’t 100% perfect got tossed. Not anymore. People will eat anything now. Today, our FCard retailers will sell food that used to be routinely tossed.”</p>
   <p>Jason didn’t tell the entire truth. Sure, there was a surprising amount of food getting to the stores, especially now that the semis were nationalized and the roads were cleared and patrolled. But still, there was less food, by a long shot, out there. And the food that was getting through were staples, like grains and minimally processed foods. People were getting a sustainable amount of calories, but much less than they were used to. America was on a forced diet.</p>
   <p>Jason got serious about the next subject. “This is top secret. One of the problems we’re seeing emerge is the ‘paras.’ That’s short for ‘paramilitaries.’ They’re vigilantes. They kill and kidnap people who they view as corrupt.” He was uncomfortable and said, “This is usually government officials.” He was saying what everyone knew.</p>
   <p>“The paras,” Jason said, “are almost always fellow government employees, often police and even some military. Some of the para foot soldiers are civilians, but the paras get their leadership and intelligence from insiders, like police. Many para units started when cops would go ‘off the clock’ to deal with a particular criminal or gang that they weren’t getting approval to arrest.” They weren’t getting approval, Jeanie knew, because the criminals were probably protected by the authorities.</p>
   <p>Jason continued. “The number of paras has started to grow and they have started to get bolder and bolder. Now they are also targeting public officials perceived to be corrupt. We’ve been blaming a lot of the killings and disappearances of officials on the right-wing militias, Red Brigades, and even the Oath Keepers. But it’s really the paras. They are everywhere.”</p>
   <p>This was scary to Jeanie because she had always felt safe with the walls and troops at Camp Murray keeping people out. But what if they had security threats inside Camp Murray? All those security people with guns. What if one of them decided to start shooting? Suddenly Jeanie felt like a fish in a barrel.</p>
   <p>“We obviously are not talking about this,” Jason said as he looked down. He was really concerned about this. “It’s pretty much the worst message we could send. ‘There are well armed and organized assassins in the government who are killing all the corrupt people.’ We’re not exactly highlighting the unfortunate corruption problems we’re seeing out there. The people need to believe the police and military are under control and are there to help them. We don’t want scared people to start thinking these paras are the ‘good guys.’”</p>
   <p>Jason smiled and said, “But there’s good news. The loyal police and military are rooting out the paras. They’ve made several arrests. Yesterday, most of the remaining Spokane police department and several deputy sheriffs were arrested by the FBI. It was pretty awful. Cops turning on cops. Some departments are in full civil wars between paras and the cops trying to prosecute them. It’s a mess. Oh, and to further complicate matters, some paras have turned into full-on gangs themselves.”</p>
   <p>Jason continued, “In this state, the paras seem most active in eastern Washington and the rural areas. Well, in the rural areas, we don’t exactly have a presence except for intermittent Freedom Corps reports, so we’re assuming the paras are running things there. We see anecdotal evidence of it, like local police running towns and known criminals ending up dead. We don’t know if they’re paras or not. Maybe they’re just exercising emergency powers. We don’t know.”</p>
   <p>Jason took a breath and said, “The larger urban areas, Seattle in particular, seem to have good control over their police. These paras obviously create a political problem for us. They would be seen by the public as solving a problem the authorities can’t or, in the case of corruption, won’t. This is why we need to make sure our friends in the media do not report about paras. We don’t even want the term ‘paras’ out there. Remember, assassinations are Red Brigade or Oath Keepers, or, better yet, ‘right-wing militia terrorists.’ You can admit that there are a handful of cops acting like gangs because there are. But do not, <emphasis>do not</emphasis>, let the paras be seen as heroes.”</p>
   <p>There was one last thing for the meeting, but at the last minute Jason decided not to tell the media relations people in the conference room. It was that no one was watching the news anymore. He didn’t want the media relations people to think their work was in vain.</p>
   <p>When the Crisis first started, news ratings were through the roof. Everyone was glued to the internet, TV, and radio. Now, the numbers of hits on media websites were plummeting. Ratings for TV news and even local radio were way down. They were below, far below, the levels before the Crisis.</p>
   <p>Jason was worried that people were figuring out that the government had been lying about everything. People weren’t looking to the broken and corrupt government for solutions. They were looking to themselves. That was what worried him the most.</p>

    <p><emphasis>I Miss America</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ron Spencer was standing in line. Again. It seemed like that’s all he did all day long. At least they had gas today. But, it was “gang gas” sold by the Russians; the Russian mafia, of course. Young Russian men with AK-47s were the “security contractors” for the gas station. They were polite, but tough as nails.</p>
   <p>They spoke English with customers, but spoke Russian among themselves. It was weird to see Russian men with AKs walking around in America. It looked like some weird scene out of <emphasis>Red Dawn</emphasis>, but it was real. All the fears of the Cold War about a totally implausible Russian invasion had come a little bit true.</p>
   <p>As he was standing in line, Ron thought that the Russian mafia guards were not oppressing the people like the Soviets depicted in <emphasis>Red Dawn,</emphasis> but were just making a living. A semi-honest living. It was capitalism pure and simple, if “capitalism” meant government controls of everything and then the inevitable black market. That was as close to capitalism as anyone could get in Collapse America. At least, in the cities where the government still had control.</p>
   <p>Ron hoped the “gang gas” was not bad. Some of it had been stalling out vehicles because it had fillers in it, including water, it was rumored. But, as a non-government employee, he couldn’t get the FCards that worked at the “government gas” stations where people could get unadulterated gas. Ron had to use his regular FCards which, theoretically, could only buy food. However, regular FCards were traded like cash. The card was not tied to one person; someone could have ten of them if that’s what they bought or traded for. Or stole.</p>
   <p>Ron got a few FCards of varying amounts by trading for some silver. He bought silver steadily before the Collapse and had about 150 ounces in one-ounce pieces. He was a Mormon and was supposed to have a year’s worth of supplies for his family according to his church. But he and his wife hadn’t wanted to fill up the garage with bulky cans of food. Besides, that seemed “weird.”</p>
   <p>So, they decided to buy and store something much more compact: silver. They got “junk” coins, which were pre-1964 U.S. coins that were ninety percent silver. They would buy pre-1964 silver dollars, fifty-cent pieces, and dimes. Then they got one-ounce silver pieces.</p>
   <p>The Spencers started buying silver when it was $12 an ounce and kept getting it all the way up to $43 an ounce. Now it was $600 an ounce, kind of. It wasn’t as if people walked up with $600 of cash and bought an ounce of silver, but the price on the day before the May Day Dump was $545 an ounce.</p>
   <p>No one really used cash (paper money) to buy silver or much of anything anymore. First of all, the government made owning silver and gold a crime, although not too many people paid attention to that law. Second of all, cash didn’t buy anyone much and wasn’t accepted usually for food or gas. Some people would accept cash, but in such high amounts—thousands of dollars for a bag of groceries—that people stopped using it for the most part. Besides, with the banks closed, almost no one had cash on hand.</p>
   <p>People still used dollars to set prices. For example, groceries had a dollar price but that just meant that a certain number of dollars was taken off an FCard when a purchase was made. Dollars were now just a measuring unit for prices, not a currency used to buy and sell things.</p>
   <p>Silver, and especially gold, were king, followed by FCards. People were frequently bartering for their necessities: gas, ammo, guns, medicine. Sex was traded quite a bit, too, but not in Ron’s world. He’d heard about it, though, including rumors that good people he knew were doing it. Alcohol was a hot commodity. Drugs were less so, at least as far as Ron, the Mormon, knew. Many people were growing and smoking pot for themselves, and for trading.</p>
   <p>Ron traded a one-ounce silver piece with a corrupt FC person for $550 on three FCards. He would use those FCards to get ten gallons of gang gas that was $55 a gallon. Ron had two five-gallon gas cans with him. Not bad. He could drive for a month on that.</p>
   <p>He didn’t have a job to go to and school had been cancelled for the rest of the year—and probably years to come—so he didn’t need to drive for that. He found that he had to drive on various errands, like to get gas that day. Since he had silver, which was something he hid from everyone initially, he was asked by his neighbors to take people to the black-market clinic or move someone’s family’s stuff to a new house or pick up someone’s family members who were moving in with them. His church was very close-knit, so he did a lot of favors for them. He also did favors for his neighbors who weren’t in his church. He did favors for atheists he knew; he didn’t care. People were people. Helping people was helping people. He figured that God had guided him and his wife to get silver before the Collapse and he would use that silver to help people. The silver wasn’t his; it was a tool he’d been given to do good things.</p>
   <p>Ron decided that driving people around was his new job. There wasn’t any accounting work, so he had to do something. He made a living—sort of—by helping people. They gave him whatever they could to compensate him for his time and gas. Any little thing he or his family needed. His wife really missed a particular skin lotion, for example. He mentioned it to a couple of people he’d helped and a bottle of it appeared on his porch one morning.</p>
   <p>The power and water were still on in Olympia. The bills quit coming. Maybe that was because the postal system had stopped. Ron hadn’t seen a mail carrier in…weeks.</p>
   <p>What most people didn’t know was that the government had made a silent bargain with the population: we’ll take all your money and restrict your freedom, but we’ll get you some food and free utilities. It was kind of like the silent bargain in the old Soviet Union; bread and utilities will always be free, but we get to run your lives.</p>
   <p>The government was essentially keeping its end of the bargain on utilities. There were frequent power outages, but it was getting better. The internet was spotty at first, but that was also improving. However, access to websites the government didn’t like was restricted. It was possible to get to them, but not unless someone knew a lot about computers. And there was a risk of getting caught, which meant an FCard might become inactive. Maybe. There was so much crime that the government couldn’t really go after people who were looking at the wrong websites, but most people feared a loss of their FCards if they acted up. Many believed the government knew everything they did and could retaliate against them, like the old IRS system. Most people paid their taxes even though the government could not possibly prosecute even a tiny fraction of them. People, or sheeple as Ron called them, had been trained for generations to follow the law no matter what. That made sense when the laws were reasonable and the chances of getting caught were real. Neither of those two things were true now.</p>
   <p>Crime was a constant problem. It seemed that a sizable chunk of the population was not following any laws and were not at all afraid of prosecution. There was no functioning police force. Prosecutors and judges? Not anymore.</p>
   <p>Ron carried a revolver, a nice Ruger SP 101 .357 Magnum, with him all the time. Even in his house, which was where he’d need it most. He had a holster for it and carried it concealed, which was against the law, but whatever. He’d be out of his mind not to carry a gun when he was carrying an ounce of silver, or two gas cans. The Russians were good about making sure their gas station was safe; they needed to have people coming to their places to buy things, but once a customer left the gas station, they were on their own.</p>
   <p>Ron pulled into the Cedars subdivision where he lived and sighed. The FC dorks were “guarding” the entrance. He had quit going to the worthless neighborhood meetings because the weenies were running the show and because Nancy Ringman, the leader of the weenies, had flipped out and accused Ron and his family of being “Mormon hoarders.” Why even go?</p>
   <p>But, Ron heard that Nancy showed up last night at the meeting and seemed to appear sane. She said she had an allergic reaction to some medication that had previously caused her to “not be herself.” She said she had some new medication and was fine. She was a pretty high-ranking government person so she probably got special access to medications, Ron thought.</p>
   <p>Nancy told everyone at the meeting she would be moving soon to “somewhere near Seattle” to run a new TDF, which was a “temporary detention facility.” It was probably one of those political prisons they were setting up. Not a maximum security thing for criminals. These were “Club Feds” for POIs and others who were causing non-life threatening problems for the government. Not much was known about the TDFs. Given what he’d heard about them and who was being sent there, it wasn’t exactly a torture chamber. They were kind of like locked dormitories. It seemed that TDFs were where they sent tax protestors, Patriot bloggers, and other troublemakers who were violating the myriad of new laws. The authorities wanted to make examples of them and scare the population into doing what they were told. The authorities needed the TDFs, which were springing up everywhere because there weren’t enough regular prison cells. Filling the TDFs to the brim demonstrated where the government’s priorities were. They had let most of the real criminals go a few weeks earlier to save money, but were now trying to round up political enemies and seemed to find the resources to house them in TDFs.</p>
   <p>That reminded Ron about his former neighbor, Grant. Where were Grant and his family? Were they together? Grant had been on the POI list and owned some assault rifles. Ron figured Grant was probably in Texas now, where he’d be safe. Grant’s wife had been heartbroken that he’d left, so who knows where she and the kids went. It was sad that a nice family like that had been broken up by this whole Collapse.</p>
   <p>The weenies were all against a “militaristic” guard when it was Ron and Grant organizing it, but when the Freedom Corps came to the neighborhood, the weenies were suddenly all for an armed guard, under the control of the FC. It seemed the weenies were opposed to a “militaristic” group, except when it was controlled by their government buddies.</p>
   <p>The FC had those stupid hard hats. They looked ridiculous. At first, some FC guy came to Nancy’s little meetings, but he wasn’t coming any more. He must have “deputized” some of the neighborhood residents because now a few of them had the dork helmets. Three neighborhood people volunteered to be FC dicks. They were Carlos Cuevas, Rex Maldonado, and Scott Baker. They thought they were pretty cool.</p>
   <p>One of the FC dicks would oversee a few armed guards from the neighborhood. They did an OK job of keeping people out. Well, at least there hadn’t been any incursions by gangs like the night Grant shot those guys. The weenies cited this as “proof” the FC system was working. “We only had violence when the cowboys were taking the law into their own hands,” they’d say.</p>
   <p>Ron wasn’t convinced that the FC guards should get credit for keeping people out. Ron thought what actually happened was that word went out that some bad asses in the Cedars shot up a bunch of people, so stay the hell away. Little did he know that the gangs weren’t coming to the Cedars because the Olympia Police Department, what was left of it, made a deal with the gangs to stay away. The government let the gangs sell their wares, like the Russians’ gasoline, in exchange for not looting neighborhoods. Not all gangs had deals with the government, so there was still a threat of looting.</p>
   <p>Almost everyone in the Cedars was a government employee, or a former government employee since the government really didn’t have any money anymore. This was the state capitol and an upscale neighborhood. It was full of former assistant directors of state agencies, like Nancy Ringman who was the former head of the campaign finance commission. All they knew was government. Government solved problems. Private people created problems. Ron, as one of the few private-sector people, was not well received by them. Especially since Mormons like him were “fundamentalist” Christians.</p>
   <p>He wondered if he was just being a jerk about the whole government-worker versus private-sector thing. When FCards came out, his views were confirmed.</p>
   <p>It turned out that, for some reason, all the government people had higher amounts put on their FCards. They would actually brag about how high their FCard amount was. It was a status symbol. Ron and the few private-sector people in the neighborhood got a third less and had just as many dependents. So, even though there was no longer a state budget, the public employees were still giving themselves more than the private sector. Just like the good old days before the Collapse when they did the same thing via public sector unions electing bought-and-paid-for legislators who appropriated more and more money for their union pals, who returned the favor the next election cycle. They did it with tax dollars in the past, but were doing it with FCard credits now. Because they could.</p>
   <p>None of this sat well with Ron. He had been on the fence before the Collapse when Grant would talk about all the corruption and “soft tyranny.” Ron knew that Grant was right, but it just seemed so radical to say those things. “Tyranny?” In America? Oh, come on. Wasn’t that a bit of an exaggeration?</p>
   <p>No. Grant had been right. Ron felt stupid to be trapped there in the Cedars trading in silver for a few gallons of gas and having to wave at the FC idiots lining the entrance of his neighborhood so he could go home. Ron had his family, some silver, and some guns so he was better off than most, but still. He felt like he got left behind in some crappy place. He wanted to make things better.</p>
   <p>Ron was out driving one of the ladies from church so she could move into her son’s house a few miles away out in the country. He came to an intersection and there was some graffiti. It said, “I miss America.”</p>
   <p>That hit him like a ton of bricks. Ron missed America. He missed having a job, having plenty to eat, not worrying about his family, and never having to deal with all the corruption and lawlessness. He missed America, too.</p>
   <p>A few miles away, closer to the country where the church lady was moving, was some more graffiti, also in that Patriot yellow color. It said, “Resist.”</p>
   <p>Right then and there, Ron decided that he would resist. He would figure out a silent and secret way to throw a monkey wrench in the government’s machine. He was not openly a Patriot like Grant, but he would fight these bastards. Fight them. He just needed to come up with a way to do it.</p>
   <p>Then he got an idea. The perfect idea.</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>It was a beautiful morning. Nothing beat early summer in Washington State, Andy “Booger” Borger thought. It was much better than his native Pennsylvania where summer was hot and humid and full of bugs. Not here in Washington. He didn’t even mind the rain that seemed to fall nonstop from about October to March.</p>
   <p>Andy was on guard duty at Joe Tantori’s compound. He was a former Army Ranger who saw a lot of action in Iraq and then in Afghanistan as a private military contractor. Now he was a trainer for Joe’s military and law enforcement students. He was one of Joe’s dozen employees out there; the “Dirty Dozen,” as they called themselves. They had some recent new guys, too; the eight law enforcement guys who came out a couple weeks ago after quitting the force because of the budget cuts.</p>
   <p>Andy loved his job. He loved the Dirty Dozen. He loved Joe. Andy was divorced—aren’t all special operations guys? This made Joe and the Dirty Dozen Andy’s family.</p>
   <p>It was about an hour after dawn. Andy had been the observer at the guard shack all night. He was a little tired, but this guard duty was nothing like the sleep deprivation he experienced as a Ranger.</p>
   <p>Andy thought he heard a vehicle. That was weird. He was miles from the nearest town, and there was hardly ever any traffic.</p>
   <p>It wasn’t just one vehicle. It was several. Heavy vehicles. It almost sounded like a convoy of military vehicles. They made a distinctive sound he’d heard hundreds of times. What the hell was a military convoy doing out here?</p>
   <p>Then Andy saw them. The lead vehicle was an armored Humvee with several five-ton military trucks following. Andy counted six trucks.</p>
   <p>Oh shit. “Franco one, Franco two,” Andy said into the radio to Joe’s base. “Visitors. Repeat: visitors. Seven vehicles. Six are five-tons.” Andy looked to see if any had heavy machine guns. Nope. They were just troop transports. “No Ma deuces, just trucks.” (“Ma deuce” referred to an M2 .50 machine gun.) Trucks full of military. While the Dirty Dozen were good and they had the backing of eight new guys, they were likely no match for the 60 guys that could be held inside six five-tons.</p>
   <p>I might die today, Andy thought to himself. He’d had that thought a few times before, but it was still a big deal each time he had it.</p>
   <p>The radios came to life. A truckload of Joe’s guys from the main compound were coming up the road for back up. Andy heard their truck start up about a minute after he radioed it in. In that amount of time, the military convoy had slowly crept to the gate.</p>
   <p>Andy had been in combat many times, but he was scared right now. Really scared. It was weird: he wasn’t as scared when insurgents were trying to kill him in Iraq. They were actually pretty shitty fighters. He had no fear of them.</p>
   <p>But he was scared of what was rumbling down the road at him right now. An American military convoy. That scared the shit out of him. Unless they were National Guard pukes, the men in those trucks would be formidable. It would be a hell of a fight.</p>
   <p>Wait. Why would an American military convoy be coming out to Joe’s compound? A raid? What had they done? Well, they possessed about a 100 illegal ARs, some AKs, and some other now-restricted firearms. That was probably it. The old bumper sticker about prying his gun out of his “cold dead hands” flashed through Andy’s mind. Maybe that was going to happen today. So be it. Andy had long ago decided that he’d die for his guys. No biggie. It had to happen sometime. He should have been killed a couple of times in Iraq and once in Afghanistan, but had lucked out. Maybe this was his time.</p>
   <p>Andy shouldered his AK, which he preferred to AR. Out of habit, he aimed his AK at the lead Humvee. He didn’t really expect to take it out given all its armor, including the windshield. Andy’s main weapon was his radio. He’d use that to get more guns on target.</p>
   <p>“C’mon, c’mon,” Andy said into the radio, using his left hand to key the mic while his right hand held the AK on target. He wanted that truck load of Joe’s guys to get there right now.</p>
   <p>“Don’t shoot, Booger,” Joe said on the radio. “Don’t shoot unless they shoot first. I think I know what this is all about.”</p>
   <p>The military convoy had come to a full stop by now. No one was getting out. Their engines were still idling. It was that familiar diesel idling sound.</p>
   <p>The truckload of Joe’s guys came screaming up the road to the gate and guard shack where Andy was. He was glad to see them. Even if they were about to die, at least he’d have company when it happened.</p>
   <p>The truck stopped at the guard shack and Joe jumped out of the back and ran up to the gate to get a better look at the convoy. He didn’t have a rifle. He waved at the Humvee. A hand from the Humvee waved back and then a man got out of it.</p>
   <p>Andy aimed his AK at the man getting out of the Humvee. The man getting out was a Marine..</p>
   <p>Joe started laughing. He threw his hands up and started running toward the Marine who put up his hands, as if to greet Joe.</p>
   <p>Joe hugged him; a “bro hug” not a “chick hug.” The Marine seemed uncomfortable with even the “bro hug.”</p>
   <p>Joe said, “About damned time, Marty.” The Marine smiled.</p>
   <p>Joe turned around to Andy and the truck of guys and yelled, “Stand down. These are friendlies.”</p>
   <p>Joe and the Marine talked for a while. Both seemed to be pretty happy.</p>
   <p>Andy recognized the Marine now. He was Gunnery Sergeant Booth, whose first name was Martin. Andy remembered that the Gunnery Sergeant was a friend of Joe’s. Marty apparently brought more friends. Andy still didn’t know what this was all about. There wasn’t a class scheduled for today, so the Marines weren’t here for that.</p>
   <p>Joe opened the gate. Andy, who trusted Joe with his life, couldn’t help asking, “Boss, you sure you want to do that?”</p>
   <p>Joe laughed and, with a huge smile, waved to Andy and the guys in the truck to come over to him.</p>
   <p>“Well, gentlemen, we have a few more guests out here at the compound,” Joe said. “A few squads of Marines and a bunch of supplies. Boys, we’re in the ‘security contractor’ business now.”</p>
   <p>Huh? “Security contractors?”</p>
   <p>Joe said, “I’ll fill you in in a while. Let these guys in. We’ll brief you as soon as they’re squared away.”</p>
   <p>Joe jumped back into the truck and it went out the gate to turn around and lead the convoy into the compound. Andy watched as the seven vehicles went past. Four of the five-ton trucks were packed with Marines and two had supplies. It was a lot of stuff.</p>
   <p>Andy wanted to go down the road and see what all this was about. Lucky for him, his guard shift was up.</p>
   <p>He radioed, “Franco one, Franco two. Send in the day shift.” A few minutes later, one of the new guys, Michael “Cowboy” Troy, a former Sheriff’s deputy, came to relieve him.</p>
   <p>As Cowboy Troy came up the road, Andy asked, “So what’s the deal?”</p>
   <p>“The Dirty Dozen just became the Dirty Several Dozen,” Cowboy Troy said. “They came from Bangor sub base. AWOL. Brought their weapons, machine guns, crates of ammo, and tons of other stuff. Looks like maybe five squads.”</p>
   <p>Andy hadn’t been too happy when the close-knit Dirty Dozen became diluted with the new cops, but now all these Marines? Then Andy remembered what he felt like when he thought that convoy was coming to attack the compound. Fear. Being outnumbered. Facing a really good American military unit. Now they would have amazing manpower and firepower out at Joe’s place. Andy was warming up to the idea of the new arrivals. Maybe this wasn’t a bad thing.</p>
   <p>He walked back down the road, which was a quarter mile to the main house, out buildings, bunkhouse, and classrooms. Three Marines were walking up the road toward him in full kit. One of the Marines said, “We’re augmenting your guard.” Andy nodded. That made sense. Maybe Uncle Sam would want to reclaim all his stuff that had just been stolen.</p>
   <p>Joe’s wife and kids were staying at the main house. They were greeting the Marines, who were extremely polite. “Yes sir,” and “Yes ma’am,” they all said.</p>
   <p>Gunnery Sgt. Booth was putting the Marines to work unloading the two cargo trucks. Andy couldn’t believe his eyes. He saw several M240 machine guns, a couple of Ma Deuce heavy .50 machine guns, and even a couple of anti-tank rockets. There were stacks and stacks of wooden crates of ammo, and probably 100 cases of MREs. Joe was getting the forklift to unload the crates. He had a cigar lit and a huge smile.</p>
   <p>Andy helped with all the unloading and getting the Marines quartered. He counted fifty-six of them. With the three up on guard duty, that was fifty-nine. Just shy of six squads. Crap. That was a lot of Marines.</p>
   <p>There were forty-seven spots in the bunkhouse for the students. The Marines brought some heavy duty tents. They were setting up two to house the Marines who didn’t have a place in the bunkhouse. Sgt. Booth was talking to Joe about where to place the machine guns. After an hour or two, things were pretty squared away. Everyone was hungry.</p>
   <p>Andy started to smell something tasty. Joe’s wife and couple of the Dirty Dozen hollered that breakfast was ready. The Marines were probably up all night packing that stuff. Sgt. Booth gave them permission to eat and they went into the dining area of the classroom where the students ate during classes. The classroom was jam packed with Marines. It was a beautiful sight when security was in short supply.</p>
   <p>After everyone had breakfast, Joe stood up at the front of the room and said, “Welcome gentlemen. As Gunny explained to you before you agreed to come here, I decided to hire you since the federal government no longer needs your services. You will be fed and taken care of. Your duties will be much like when you were active duty.”</p>
   <p>Joe continued. “We’ll go over your duties in more detail after you get a tour of the facilities, we work up a guard schedule, and you get some sleep, but here’s the basic deal: you are now ‘security contractors.’ I have clients in town and out here who need their lives and property protected. I have some super guys, the Dirty Dozen and some former LEOs, but we’ve got even more super guys now. We will be conducting show-of-force patrols in town and dealing with whatever we need to deal with. Some of you will remain here to protect this place.”</p>
   <p>Joe paused, wondering how much he should tell the Marines, and then decided to tell them just about everything. “My clients,” Joe said, “pay me in gold, silver, gasoline, food, and whatever else they have. Maybe those damned FCards. Let me worry about the business end. You will be paid a share of whatever I collect. You guys are way better off than the general population and your former colleagues who agreed to be shipped off to go kill Americans.”</p>
   <p>It got silent when he said that. Joe motioned for Booth to say something.</p>
   <p>“Military discipline will be maintained,” Booth said. “By me and Mr. Tantori’s men, too. If any of you dishonor this unit, stealing, killing without justification, or, God forbid, raping,” Booth looked over at Joe’s wife and said, “sorry ma’am,” and continued, “then I will shoot you. Is that clear?”</p>
   <p>A thunderous, “Yes, Sergeant!”</p>
   <p>Booth continued, “This is not a militia. This is not a vigilante force. This is not a gang. We are security contractors working for Mr. Tantori and, ultimately, his clients. We treat the population with maximum courtesy. These people in town aren’t Taliban. Now, that being said, we’re more than just a rented police force out here. We’re biding time until we fight in something bigger.” That surprised Joe’s men, but didn’t faze the Marines. They had discussed the “something bigger” fight before they came out there.</p>
   <p>“Each of you,” Booth continued, “is here because you are a Patriot and would not follow unconstitutional orders, like shipping out down south. Eventually, when this war kicks off for real, we’ll be linking up with Patriot forces and taking this country back.”</p>
   <p>“Oorah!” the Marines chanted. Booth allowed himself to smile, something he didn’t do much when he had his “sergeant face” on. “You’ll be getting further instructions from your squad leaders. That is all.” Another round of “oorah!” went up and the Marines started cleaning up the plates.</p>
   <p>Joe was concerned about how the people in town would react to his “security contractors.” The county Joe was in was full of granolas, many of whom were Baby Boomer retirees from Seattle. These weren’t the homesteading kind of granolas, who weren’t a problem and actually were a benefit since they were largely self-sufficient. These were statist granolas. The rich lefties in the county who already had their property and set up barriers, usually environmental regulations, to keep others from competing with them. This was the “establishment” of the county. They were the ones, the chair of the county commission and the Sheriff in particular, who, before the Collapse, tried to shut down Joe’s training facility. Grant Matson and the Washington Association of Business represented Joe in court and won a court case against the county. This was how Joe met Grant.</p>
   <p>Joe was tempted to send his men to the homes of the establishment, especially the county commissioners and former Sheriff who caused Joe so much trouble. The thought of some bloody payback crossed Joe’s mind many times. He could snap his fingers and they would be dead. But he didn’t do it.</p>
   <p>Turns out he didn’t need to. Two days before the Marines arrived, a group of citizens went after all the corrupt bastards that had been running that county. The former establishment was now in hiding. No quite knew where. They probably went to Seattle to be with their big-government buddies. But who cared? They couldn’t boss people around and steal their property when they were hiding out. Problem solved.</p>
   <p>A few weeks after the Marines came out there, Joe was actually making more than before the Collapse. His overhead was low—the Marines worked for food and shelter, and an occasional bottle of booze—and he didn’t have to pay any taxes. He never realized how much time he and his company spent on stupid paperwork like withholding taxes and endless reports to government agencies. Now he spent that time on productive things, like making money.</p>
   <p>Slowly the town and county were getting back on their feet. With the formerly all-powerful government essentially gone, and with all the statist granolas fleeing back to Seattle, the hardworking and self-reliant people remained. They thrived when there wasn’t any royalty to keep the serfs in their place, as it had been before the Collapse. A medical clinic started up in town. The power and water stayed on. Joe’s company trained a group of volunteer police and they were doing a decent job.</p>
   <p>The Dirty Dozen and the LEOs blended in well with the Marines. The whole group became a tight-knit group. The Marines were an amazing bunch of kids. Well, men, but they seemed like kids to Joe. They were very good at their jobs. Just like everyone else out at Joe’s, the Marines had no family except each other. They were far from home, which was the South and mountain West for many of them. Joe’s crew was their family. And they’d fight for their family.</p>
   <p>They would get their chance soon. The men knew that the security contractor job was just to maintain them while they were getting ready for…what they all knew was coming.</p>

   </title>
   <p>That damned rooster woke up Tom Foster again. He wasn’t a morning person and that rooster crowed at dawn, which was about 5:00 a.m. this time of the year in Washington State.</p>
   <p>The rooster was one of the big adjustments Tom and all the other Washington Association of Business senior staff and their families were making to adjust to life out at the Prosser Farm.</p>
   <p>Not that they were complaining. They would have been dead back in Olympia, which was just a few miles away. They were wanted by the government as “Persons of Interest.” Worse yet, the gangs of government union thugs, or whatever they were, would tear them limb from limb if they knew who they were. Tom could still remember the sickening scene of the WAB offices on fire after the big budget-cut protest, which happened right before they decided to get out of Dodge and go to the Prossers’ farm. Tom was glad to be at the farm. But that rooster. Did it have to do that so early?</p>
   <p>Other than little things like the rooster, the Prosser’s city guests were doing quite well out at the farm. They didn’t have real jobs, except the chores they did out there, but they didn’t have taxes, either. It was actually relaxing.</p>
   <p>In their pre-Collapse jobs, the WAB guys were the targets of hateful political attacks. They were sued by the government for things they clearly didn’t do. They were audited by just about every government agency that could audit them, and in pre-Collapse America, there were a lot of them. Their wives and kids were told they were not welcome among polite Olympia society because WAB people were such right-wing monsters, so hiding out on a farm actually seemed like a vacation.</p>
   <p>The WAB wives were not feeling like this was a vacation, however. They were making the best of it and were glad to be safe, but for the first times in their lives, their suburban wife skills weren’t needed. No one needed the kids picked up from soccer, no one needed buttons sewn on their Girl Scout uniforms. There was no juggling of career and kids. The farm wife skills of Molly Prosser were more important out there, but the WAB wives didn’t know how to do a lot of those things. At least at first. They learned quickly and had a good attitude about it, even though they wanted their old lives back. They felt guilty that they didn’t love it out on the farm because they knew they were literally dead back in town. But, still. The younger kids loved it out here, which was really important to the parents and made any little hardships out there well worth it. The kids got to play with animals and even seemed to enjoy their chores. It was like playing “farmhouse” for them. Maybe the novelty of the chores would wear off, but so far it hadn’t.</p>
   <p>The older kids, sixteen year-old Derek Foster in particular, didn’t like the farm life too much. He missed his girlfriend back in town. He asked his mom if he could call her. No way, she said. That could get them all killed, although Joyce Foster didn’t say it that way to avoid scaring Derek. Teenage puppy love would have to be yielded to preventing their slaughter. That made sense to the grownups. To Derek, though, not so much. Seeing his girlfriend was all he thought about.</p>
   <p>They had plenty to eat out there; lots of beef from their own cows. The smaller kids wouldn’t understand the part about killing the cows for food, so, when they butchered one, the grownups told the kids that one cow must have run away. The older kids knew, though.</p>
   <p>Molly Prosser had always canned and dried fruits and vegetables, even before the Collapse. That was just what people did out there, and it also saved them a ton of money. The Prossers were in the full swing of feeding themselves before the Collapse.</p>
   <p>They had a small out building they called the “fruit shed” where they stored all their canned and dried foods. It was a standalone insulated shed in the shade of a big tree that kept cool in the summer and, with just one light bulb on all the time, kept the food above freezing in the winter. It was full of food before the Collapse. And now, with all the extra hands available, they were canning and drying more food than ever. They were eating last year’s food. At first, the city guests didn’t like home canned and dried food, but they quickly got over it. Now they actually liked it. “This tastes amazing,” the city guests would say over and over to the Prossers. “It’s so much more flavorful.” That was especially true of the real eggs they had out there. They tasted so much better than the store-bought ones the WAB families used to eat.</p>
   <p>The city guests were losing a little weight, too. They exercised a lot more out on the farm and the food they ate was much better for them. They slept better out there, too. They started to wonder why they had been rushing around and living on drive-thru and take-out in the past. To get to soccer practice on time, was the answer. But why did they have to do so many soccer practices? Why did they work so hard before the Collapse just to earn more money, that would only be taxed away? Any money they saved was taken away by the inflation in the run up to the Collapse. After the Collapse, all their savings were gone because the banks were closed. They had worked so hard and sacrificed so much for…worthless bank accounts? They were just doing what everyone around them was doing pre-Collapse. They never thought about whether it made any sense. The Collapse was the restart they needed.</p>
   <p>One of the big reasons the Prossers and their guests were doing so well on the farm was that they weren’t entirely on their own. They lived on a road that had a half dozen other farms. The Prossers and their relatives had known the other families for decades and, in some cases, generations. They traded among themselves.</p>
   <p>It wasn’t really trading; it was more like sharing. Everyone just took care of each other. It was just how it was, and how it had always been out there. Taking care of each other had been increasing leading up to the Collapse as the economy was tanking, and then it just accelerated after the Collapse.</p>
   <p>At first, the WAB guests wondered how they could survive without near daily runs to the grocery store, Costco, and the mall like they had been doing pre-Collapse. They could not conceive of a world where they didn’t drive around all day buying things.</p>
   <p>They quickly saw that the Prossers and their neighbors didn’t need to go into town for food or other things. At first, they would go in for things like toiletries and gas. But it was getting more and more dangerous in town. There weren’t roving hordes of motorcycle gangs, but gangs ran everything. Some were mean and some were polite, like the Russians at the gas stations, but they were gangs, nonetheless.</p>
   <p>The Prosser neighbors had another good reason to not really want to go to town. They knew that the Prossers had some guest families out there from Olympia that the police might be looking for. The guests didn’t look like criminals, so they assumed it must be political. The neighbors figured it out pretty quickly. They knew that Jeff Prosser worked for WAB.</p>
   <p>The neighbors all hated the government for various reasons. The government had destroyed the economy, taken their savings, and before the Collapse, taken away their ability to live out on their farms because of the insane environmental regulations. They wanted this nightmare to be over. They wanted to start over. They wanted a new government—one that was limited, constitutional, fair, and left them alone. They would die before they let anything happen to the Prossers or their WAB guests. They were glad to do their little part by protecting the WAB guests.</p>
   <p>The WAB guys had a laptop and some cheap microphones. For the past few weeks, they were recording Rebel Radio and burning it to the CDs. They couldn’t put the recordings up on the internet because they’d get caught, so they went to a “sneaker net”: delivering CDs by walking them someplace instead of using the internet to deliver the content.</p>
   <p>Since they couldn’t broadcast Rebel Radio, they decided to go “samizdat,” which was the Russian word for “self-publishing” that the Russian dissidents used during the Soviet tyranny. Dissidents would get a typewriter from the black market and type essays on freedom, one copy at a time. They couldn’t make copies because copy machines were highly restricted. They would type the same essay over and over again and secretly distribute it. Readers would read it and pass it on to the next trusted person.</p>
   <p>The WAB guys started calling these episodes of Rebel Radio the “samizdat episodes.” They would record an episode and do their usual ripping on the government. They had segments like “Who Saw That Coming?” This was a humorous, but cutting, description of all the pre-Collapse indicators leading up to something like the government running out of money and how they had been trying to tell people it was coming. They avoided an “I told you so” tone, and made devastating political observations.</p>
   <p>Another segment on Rebel Radio was called “After the Reset.” It was about how getting rid of the criminals running things and returning to a limited government and constitutional republic would make life far better for everyone. They provided details on what post-Collapse life would be like. Practical details; not pie-in-the-sky ideology. They discussed how the Patriot approach would lead to business thriving, government treating people fairly, and a future for young people. They constantly talked about how young people had been robbed of a future.</p>
   <p>The main purpose of the Rebel Radio samizdat episodes was to encourage the resistance. To rally fighters and gray men, even though the WAB guys didn’t really know if anyone was listening or if there were any fighters or gray men out there. The samizdat episodes described why things had gone so horribly wrong and, even more importantly, how they could be fixed. These broadcasts gave the Resistance hope. Hope was everything during these times.</p>
   <p>If there was no way to fix things, why would people risk their lives to fix them? Why not just take the measly scraps they’re given on their FCard and be like all the other sheeple? People out there needed to have an answer for that question. They got one every episode.</p>
   <p>They didn’t have the production capabilities of the pre-Collapse Rebel Radio episodes; they had to add the intro music by playing the music CD in the background while talking, but the poor production quality actually made the samizdat episodes better. It gave them a true “rebel” feel, like they were being recorded in some hideout with government agents looking for them. Which was true.</p>
   <p>After recording several episodes and filling up a CD, they would make a handful of copies on their laptop and label them with a Sharpie pen. At first, Ben suggested that they use gloves so their fingerprints weren’t on them. Tom said it didn’t matter because the government knew who they were. It was just where they were that the government didn’t know.</p>
   <p>Distribution of the CDs depended on the one non-Patriot in the group. She was Adrienne, Joyce Foster’s younger sister, who lived in Olympia. Adrienne was the wild child in the family. She wasn’t really into politics, but loved adrenaline. She was a gorgeous woman in her mid-thirties with black hair and green eyes. She could drink the boys under the table. She was single and liked it that way.</p>
   <p>Dennis would get the CDs to Adrienne in Olympia where she made a handful of copies on her computer. She got them out to people Joyce identified. Those people did the same, and the number of copies started to slowly grow. People in the Olympia area, then the Seattle area, then beyond, started to risk getting arrested to hear Rebel Radio on CD.</p>
   <p>Adrienne’s cover was selling pot. No one went to jail for that. It wasn’t the hard drugs that the gangs sold, so there wasn’t any danger of pissing them off. Adrienne’s cover for sneaking around and meeting people on street corners was that she was selling pot. That was much more socially acceptable than distributing Rebel Radio CDs, and much less likely to get her in trouble with the law.</p>
   <p>The hard part was getting blank CDs. At some point, the stores in Olympia would wise up and stop selling them or, worse yet, arrest the people buying blank CDs in bulk, so Adrienne decided to get some blank CDs on her own. And maybe have some fun in the process.</p>
   <p>Cam, a guy down the street, who was half cute, worked for the state as a high-ranking computer guy. Actually, Cam used to work for the state, but since they weren’t paying him anymore, he didn’t go to work. Adrienne told him one day that she was making music CDs and selling them to make enough to supplement her FCard, but she couldn’t find any blank CDs. He said he had cases of them at work and he still had the keys. She winked, gave him her sexiest look—which was very sexy—and asked him, “What does a girl have to do get herself some of those CDs?”</p>
   <p>Cam was happy to oblige. This whole Crisis had been stressful and bleak. Now a beautiful woman wanted to sleep with him. That was the best news he’d had in years. And all she wanted was some stupid CDs sitting at work. Cam couldn’t believe how lucky he was.</p>
   <p>Every week or so when she needed CDs, Adrienne went over to Cam’s place and snuck in a quickie. She actually enjoyed it. She even went over a couple times when she didn’t need CDs. The fact that she was doing it for the Resistance made it even more exciting. Cam was married, so Adrienne knew he wouldn’t rat her out because he didn’t exactly want any attention paid to the fact that he was having an affair and stealing state property. Besides, Dennis said he would take care of Cam if Cam decided to do something stupid.</p>
   <p>The WAB guys had a way of knowing if the samizdat episodes were successful. In each episode, they would suggest a new graffiti message, which was the genesis of “I miss America.” Dennis would come back from town and tell them how many times he saw the graffiti they suggested in a given episode. Adrienne would hear from her network of the slogans appearing in nearby cities and tell Dennis, who would pass it on to the WAB guys. They would then do a “shout out” to that city so the people there knew that their messages were being received in the Rebel Radio “bunker” as they called their location.</p>
   <p>This pumped up the Resistance. They knew the Rebel Radio guys could see the graffiti out there. Men and women risking arrest to spray paint Patriot graffiti got some recognition for their efforts.</p>
   <p>But, as it turns out, the Resistance weren’t the only ones listening to the samizdat episodes of Rebel Radio.</p>

   </title>
   <p>It was another morning briefing at Camp Murray. Jason came in and said, “A light briefing today. We just have some political things to discuss,” as he got a PowerPoint ready on the screen.</p>
   <p>“PsyOps,” Jason said, which meant the Psychological Operations soldiers of the National Guard, the propaganda unit, “has become concerned about some graffiti messages. We’re seeing more and more of this. This graffiti appears to be organized. Standardized messages and, as you’ll see, standardized colors. This alarms the PsyOps guys, who have seen this standardization as a sign of a strong insurgency in every country they’ve operated in. They’d like some suggestions on counter messages. That’s what you guys, the political people, are for. Tell me your reactions to each message and how we can counter it.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie noticed a female soldier in the room who was new to the briefings. She was taking notes. She must be PsyOps.</p>
   <p>Jason showed the first screen. It said in red letters “Resist!” He asked, “Thoughts?”</p>
   <p>“Looks communist or revolutionary,” someone in the conference room said. “Kind of old fashioned. Like the 60s. Red Brigade kind of stuff.” The group agreed it was not effective because it was associated with the Red Brigade. No need to counter that message because it actually drove people toward the government. They would want the government to protect them from the Red Brigade.</p>
   <p>“OK,” said Jason, “now what do you think?” It said in yellow paint: “Resist.”</p>
   <p>“More effective,” someone else said. “Doesn’t seem communist, especially with the ‘Don’t Tread on Me’ yellow color. And no exclamation point. More of a statement to resist than a call to an uprising. It seems more adult and even keeled than the red ‘Resist!’” The group agreed this was an effective message. The best counter message they could come up with was “why resist recovery?” Someone proposed a counter message of “why resist returning to normal?” The group quickly shot that down because returning to the “normal” of, say, a few weeks or even years ago was returning to a budget collapse, massive unemployment, inflation, a dysfunctional political system, and corruption. The group agreed that a yellow “Resist” was a powerful message for the Patriots.</p>
   <p>Another screen showed “Be the Resistance” in Patriot yellow. The group agreed this was effective, too because it was asking people to be drawn into something bigger than him or herself. It was recruiting people. And they could join by just “being.” The PsyOps soldier said, “This is the perfect ‘Gray Man’ message: Just be yourself and quietly resist. No one is asking you to die. Just ‘be.’ This is a powerful message.” No one had a counter message for “Be the Resistance.” It was a great slogan for the Patriots.</p>
   <p>The next screen said, in black, “There is no gov’t.” The first person said, “I think this helps us. ‘There is no gov’t’ drives people toward safety and security, and that’s us. People want government now since it’s the only thing getting food onto the shelves. So saying there is no government adds to the crisis atmosphere and makes government even more needed and desired.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie disagreed about the “There is no gov’t” graffiti. She said, “I think it’s fairly effective. It challenges our authority. That’s how insurgencies win. The black paint is a symbol of anarchists, which most people don’t like, so that part of the message is ineffective. But you put that message in yellow, the so-called Patriot color, and people will say, ‘Yeah, there is no government. They’ve screwed everything up. We’ve got nothing to lose by turning on the government.’ That hurts us.” Jeanie realized she was able to peer into the mind of the Undecideds and even the Patriots a little too well. Because, she hated to admit it, that’s where her natural sympathies laid.</p>
   <p>The next screen had in green paint, “They’re not listening to you.” Everyone agreed that message hurt the government, but people thought the green color conveyed an environmentalist message, which was confusing. “You put ‘They’re not listening to you’ in Patriot yellow and you’ve got a powerful message,” someone said. Most nodded.</p>
   <p>“This is the last one,” Jason said. It was the most powerful one in his opinion. It said “I miss America” in yellow.</p>
   <p>“Wow!” Jeanie said. “That one stings. It captures everything we don’t want people thinking. The past was good: no shortages, no serious crime, no financial collapse, no states ‘opting out.’ No bad stuff.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie continued, “This ‘I miss America’ message captures everyone’s hopes and dreams about the greatness of America and how it has been destroyed. That captures the sentiment of,” Jeanie almost said “most,” but settled on “many people out there. Not to mention the play on words about ‘Miss America’ the beauty contest. That,” said Jeanie, “is a powerful message.” Jeanie looked around the room. Most of the people were not pleased that she was so enthusiastic about what a great message “I miss America” was. So she needed to focus back on her job: a counter message.</p>
   <p>Jeanie said, “The only counter message is ‘America always sucked.’ No one wants that to be their argument.”</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>

   <p>Guard duty was one of the things that was very different for the families on Prosser Road. They never had a need for a guard at the gate to Prosser Road before, but now they did, even though they didn’t have a lot of people out there. A few of them were Jeff Prosser’s older aunts and uncles so they weren’t much help on guard duty. Besides Jeff and the WAB guests—Tom, Ben, and Brian—the only other two guard candidates were Dennis, who was in his mid-thirties, and “Granny” as they called her. She was Jeff’s great aunt; in her sixties, but in good shape. She spent her whole life on the farm and could handle a few hours of sitting by the gate with a shotgun, especially if it wasn’t raining.</p>
   <p>Besides, no one came to the gate on Prosser Road. They were way out in the sticks, several turns off the main road. People had to know where they were going to get there. Granny often took a guard shift in the morning. She liked it. She was outside where it was quiet. One of the guys would take the afternoon guard duty and then two more would split night guard duty. The WAB guests knew enough about guns to at least get a warning shot off to alert the others. Each home was like a fortress. It wasn’t exactly a “tactical” defense plan but, given that no one ever came out there, it was good enough. Probably.</p>
   <p>As Granny was out watching some deer grazing across the road around 10 in the morning, she thought she heard the sound of a car. She did. A Prius, in fact. Coming down the road and slowing down at the Prosser Road gate. It had government license plates.</p>
   <p>She picked up her shotgun, but held it to her side so the occupants of the car couldn’t see she had it. She hoped the car would drive past. Instead, it slowed down and stopped about fifty yards from the gate. Granny and the car just stared at each other for a while. She wanted to wave them in and chat with the visitors, which was her impulse. But, not in these times. Who knew who was in that government-looking Prius and what they wanted. Granny knew what they wanted. She was scared. Really scared.</p>
   <p>Finally, the doors of the Prius opened up and two men came out. They were wearing pistol belts with guns and had their hands to their sides. They had hard hats. Granny recognized those hard hats from TV. They were the Freedom Corps.</p>
   <p>The FC men were fat. They looked like they hadn’t been out of their cubicles in months. They seemed out of place with those helmets and pistol belts. They looked angry and uncomfortable.</p>
   <p>The FC men started walking toward her. She had a little walkie talkie, but it was on the bench a few feet away. She didn’t want to look suspicious by talking on the radio. That was a tough decision: alert Jeff on the radio or just try to talk her way out of this? Her instinct was to not look suspicious. They were probably just lost.</p>
   <p>When the men were about twenty yards away, one of them yelled—they were close enough that they didn’t need to yell—“Are you armed?” That frightened Granny. She nodded and turned so they could see her shotgun up against her side.</p>
   <p>The FC drew their pistols and screamed at her, “Drop it! Drop it old lady or you’re dead! Drop it now, bitch!” The FC men had received a few hours of training about how most people out in the rural areas were teabaggers and probably a threat. Intimidate them, they had learned in training.</p>
   <p>Granny was terrified. She dropped the shotgun. She put her hands up. These men were scaring her.</p>
   <p>One of the men, the passenger, pointed his gun right at her and slowly walked forward. When he got to the gate, he grabbed the shotgun on the ground and took it. He walked back to the Prius and threw it in trunk.</p>
   <p>“What’s your name?” the driver asked while the other one was taking the shotgun.</p>
   <p>“Beatrice Prosser,” Granny said.</p>
   <p>“Who lives on this road?” The other one screamed with his gun still pointed at her head.</p>
   <p>Granny named off all the families.</p>
   <p>“Do you know a Tom Foster from Olympia?” one of them screamed. There was really no need for the screaming, she thought.</p>
   <p>“Who?” Granny asked. “Foster? I don’t know any Fosters and I know everyone around here. Are you sure you have the right address?” She was pulling this off pretty well, she thought. She was the most scared she’d been in her life.</p>
   <p>The suggestion that they were lost only made the driver mad. “Shut up,” he said. “We’re not lost. We’re looking for someone. He’s a terrorist. Tom Foster of the Washington Association of Business. Do you know him or have you seen him?”</p>
   <p>“No,” Granny said meekly. She started to cry. It was genuine. She was terrified.</p>
   <p>It was silent for a while. The FC were deciding what to do. They would search the houses on that road. They had received a report that a few days ago that Tom Foster’s cell phone had been used in the farmhouse on the hill there. It turns out it was Derek Foster trying to call his girlfriend on his dad’s cell phone.</p>
   <p>“Who lives there?” the FC passenger said, pointing to the house.</p>
   <p>“Jeff and Molly Prosser,” Granny said. “Why? Have they done something illegal? They’re good people, they…”</p>
   <p>“Shut up old lady,” said the driver. “Shut up, OK? We have to think, here.”</p>
   <p>“OK,” Granny said. She had never been treated this way, let alone had a gun pointed at her. She was so scared. She started to shake.</p>
   <p>The FC talked to each other and then the driver said, in a civil tone this time, “Open the gate.”</p>
   <p>Granny went to the padlock and put in the correct combination. She wished she had radioed Jeff. Oh, God, would she be the reason they all got killed? She felt like she’d made a horrible mistake.</p>
   <p>The lock opened and she opened the gate, and she stood there while the FC men were heading back to their car. She thought of the WAB kids. They were so sweet and innocent. They needed their parents.</p>
   <p>That’s when Granny made a decision.</p>

    <p><emphasis>Pop! Pop!</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Granny waved to the Freedom Corps men before they got in their car. “Sirs,” she yelled, “There is something you need to know about the house up there. Now that you mention it, there have been some strange men there lately.” She motioned for the men to come to her. She didn’t want to say this out loud. She started to whisper.</p>
   <p>“Jackpot,” one of the FCorps men mouthed to the other.</p>
   <p>The FC men realized that this little old lady was not a threat. She was doing the right thing by alerting the authorities about a terrorist living in her area. She was probably scared of the terrorists. The teabagger terrorists were scum, probably threatening nice little ladies like this.</p>
   <p>The FC men came jogging up to her to hear her whisper. She pointed toward Jeff and Molly’s house and said, “There’s a dog in that barn there. Be careful of him.” She pointed to the Prosser farmhouse and said, “See that? Can you see that window up there?”</p>
   <p>The FC men were squinting to look at the house.</p>
   <p>“Get right up here,” she said pointing to a dirt pile on the side of the road, “and you can see what I’m talking about.”</p>
   <p>The FC ran up onto the dirt pile where she was and squinted at the house.</p>
   <p>Granny stepped back. The FC men were now in front of her on the dirt pile and were looking away from her, facing the house.</p>
   <p>Pop! Pop!</p>
   <p>She didn’t even remember pulling out her little revolver and calmly shooting each one in back of the neck. She did remember thinking that it was only a .22 so she kept shooting until they were on the ground. Their helmets had fallen off, so she had clear shots at their heads down there on the ground. One of them was screaming. She shot him in the face until he stopped screaming. The other one was having seizures. She shot him in the head a few times until he stopped.</p>
   <p>Click, click, click. She used all eight .22 rounds from her Smith and Wesson Model 63. It had been her late husband’s favorite target pistol.</p>
   <p>Then she heard Jeff and Molly’s dog barking. That snapped her back into reality. She realized that she needed to do something with the bodies.</p>
   <p>She ran to the Prius to get her shotgun. She could not believe how calm she was. She had been thinking about those kids. They needed their parents and these men were trying to take them away. Shooting them was just like shooting a hog or calf for butchering. She went up to the bodies and pulled their guns out of their holsters.</p>
   <p>She got on her radio and said simply, “Send some men down here. Don’t let the kids know what happened.” In a few minutes, which would have been much too long if she had been in trouble, Ben and Brian came in Jeff’s truck.</p>
   <p>They couldn’t believe what they saw. By now there was a lot of blood on the ground. Crimson purple blood. It was the weirdest color they had ever seen. It was almost black in the sunlight. A very unnatural color. It didn’t look like the blood they saw on TV.</p>
   <p>“Let’s get them into the car,” Granny said, sounding almost too calm. Ben and Brian didn’t want to touch the two dead bodies. Granny sighed and said, “C’mon. They won’t bite.” She got the keys out of the pocket of the driver and drove the Prius up to the bodies. It was quiet because it was on electrical power for that slow speed. Ben and Brian still didn’t want to touch the bodies.</p>
   <p>“For goodness sake, put them in there,” she said pointing to the Prius.</p>
   <p>“Wait,” said Brian. “We’ll need to get rid of the bodies and the car. Let’s think about this first.”</p>
   <p>They thought for a few seconds. Brian looked in the car. It had a radio. “They probably checked in on their radio when they got here so someone knows this was the last place they were,” he said.</p>
   <p>More silence.</p>
   <p>“We have to move them and the car to someplace else and make it look like this happened there,” Ben said.</p>
   <p>“It can’t be too far from here or it won’t be believable,” Granny said.</p>
   <p>Brian snapped his fingers. “I’ve got it. The school. Let’s take them there after dark,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Video cameras,” Ben said.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah,” Brian said.</p>
   <p>Granny said, “Well, how about going a few miles away, maybe on the way from here to the freeway. That would lead them to believe it happened after they came here, found nothing, forgot to radio in that they found nothing here, and they got shot going back.” It sounded like a pretty good plan.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Ben said. “We’ll keep them here, over by the trees so no one will see. We’ll make sure no animals get them. We’ll need to have a guard on them.”</p>
   <p>“We’ll need all of us on guard now,” Brian said. “The FC might be coming back to see what happened to these two who didn’t radio in.”</p>
   <p>That was terrifying. They knew that they couldn’t fight off an organized force of more than a couple of police. The people checking out the disappearance would not be pencil-pusher FCs.</p>
   <p>“Keep the car running and see if they get a call on the radio from their headquarters,” Granny said. Another good idea.</p>
   <p>It was quiet for a while, and then Ben said, “OK. If nothing happens, we wait until dark, throw them in a tarp in the back of the truck, drive the Prius to a road near the freeway, get them out, put them in the car, and maybe shoot them again to get a good blood splatter in the car.” Ben had seen that on TV.</p>
   <p>“It won’t fool a serious crime investigation team…” Brian said. He’d watched those same shows on TV.</p>
   <p>Ben smirked. “They’re not doing real investigations anymore. Too busy.” That was true. For once, the lack of any real law enforcement was a good thing.</p>
   <p>“No one talks about this,” Ben said. “To anyone. At all.” Brian and Granny nodded. Ben thought some more and said, “OK, maybe Jeff. He’ll need to know that there might be visitors coming. And Tom, he’ll be a guard. And Dennis. But that’s it.” Brian and Granny nodded again.</p>
   <p>A few minutes later, Jeff came to see why Brian and Ben had jumped in his truck. Granny showed him the bodies and filled him in on what had happened and what the plan was. Jeff was upset that someone had done something to attract the attention of the authorities to their quiet little farm.</p>
   <p>In the past few weeks of the Collapse, the value of human life had gone down for most people. People were dying all the time. People were running out of medications, people were killing looters, and the authorities were killing people. Not massive killings; not a Mad Max total breakdown of society. Just lots and lots of stories indicating that killing was slowly becoming something that more and more people had encountered.</p>
   <p>That night, they carried out the plan. They needed someone to re-shoot the bodies in the car. No one volunteered. Finally, Granny said she’d do it.</p>
   <p>“Make an old lady do this?” she mumbled.</p>
   <p>Ben and Brian felt guilty about not being man enough to do it, but they could not bring themselves to do it. They just couldn’t. They threw up when they heard the pop of Granny’s rounds. It was the worst night of their lives.</p>
   <p>The authorities never came back to the Prosser Farm. The authorities were completely disorganized and riddled with corruption. Government couldn’t do anything well in the perfect conditions of peacetime. It was even worse when everything was broken.</p>
   <p>The FC men who came out were completely untrained. They were wildlife biologists from the Department of Natural Resources. They had two days of training and were sent out with pistols, which they barely knew how to use, and a radio. They didn’t check in at regular intervals. Even if they had, there was one dispatcher for over 100 FC. The FC who went out to investigate the report of Tom Foster’s cell phone being used—Derek’s call to his girlfriend—weren’t taking it too seriously. They received the report several days after the phone was used.</p>
   <p>The FC knew the terrorists, as they called the Patriots, would distribute their cell phones to runners who would go to strange locations to use the phone once. This would create a false report that the terrorist was in the strange location. So the FC didn’t actually think Tom Foster was at that farmhouse. They were just doing their job—and were glad to be one of the few with a job—when they went to the address they had been given. While a handful of Patriot fighters got the attention of very well trained law enforcement—at least the ones who hadn’t gone AWOL yet—the vast majority of the government’s crackdowns were done by laughable amateurs like the FC.</p>
   <p>The WAB families were coming to realize this. Their enemy was largely a paper tiger. This emboldened the Patriots. The FC at Prosser Farm were a perfect example. At first it’s terrifying that the authorities came to investigate a report of a fugitive in the area. Then an old lady shoots two of the investigators with a .22. Then no one comes to investigate. After that, it’s hard to be terrified of the government.</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>After the meeting about the graffiti, Jeanie spent the rest of the day doing her job: spinning the government line to the media. She did TV interviews on how the FCard system was working. She worked with the public affairs officers from a National Guard unit to do a story on how civilians and the FC were volunteering in droves to help the Guard with food and fuel distribution efforts. There were smiles all around. Jeanie was surrounded by this happy stuff all day. She was starting to believe that everything would be OK.</p>
   <p>In the late afternoon, she got a text from a strange number. It said, “Jim here. Call this number ASAP.” Jeanie was scared as she dialed.</p>
   <p>Jim answered in a whisper. “Can’t talk much,” he said. “Not supposed to be on a phone. I borrowed this phone from one of my men.”</p>
   <p>“Are you OK?” Jeanie asked.</p>
   <p>Jim paused. He didn’t want to make her worry, but the answer was “no.”</p>
   <p>“I guess so,” Jim said. “Here’s the deal. My CO,” which meant commanding officer, “came to me and said that CID found that I had some Facebook friends who are POI.” “CID” was the Army’s Criminal Investigative Division, the Guard’s internal affairs police.</p>
   <p>Facebook friends. Jeanie froze. It felt like all the blood drained out of her. They knew about Jim’s friendship with the WAB guys. Oh crap. She and Jim were in danger now.</p>
   <p>“What did your CO say?” Jeanie asked. She was hoping desperately for good news from Jim.</p>
   <p>“He said that I’m getting transferred to a ‘less sensitive’ unit,” Jim said. “I’m going out to some farm in Eastern Washington to guard it. I’m done in the Guard. My career is over. I’ll serve out my time in this new unit. They call it the ‘penal battalion.’ It’s more like being in jail. The MPs watch the unit like hawks. We get all the shit work. I mean the total shit work. I’m not supposed to be calling anyone. I gotta go. Love you. Don’t worry.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie started crying. “Wait.” She didn’t want him to hang up. “Are you going to be OK?”</p>
   <p>Jim regretted telling her what had happened. She’d just worry now.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I’ll be fine,” he said. “It’s not like I’m in an actual jail or anything. Besides, we have plenty to eat and the gangs are miles away.” He was serious: he’d be fine. Because the Guard was so screwed up they couldn’t actually pull off anything nasty towards him. He needed Jeanie to know that.</p>
   <p>“Here’s the thing,” Jim said in a whisper. He was talking quickly to get all of the information out before he had to hang up. “Nothing is going right. I mean the Guard is totally dysfunctional right now. We’re not even issued ammunition. We show the public our weapons but they don’t know that they’re unloaded. This is all a show. We don’t have radios most of the time and no one is told what frequencies to use. The political people don’t trust us; they think we’ll link up with defecting units. Half the time there’s no fuel for our vehicles. Cooked food comes sometimes. Other times we use up the MREs.”</p>
   <p>Jim paused and then kept going to get all the info out to Jeanie. “At first, most of the men were reporting for duty. A week ago, it was down to half. Now it’s even less. People are just melting away. The next morning they’re not around. We can’t do a thing. No one can make a decision. Everything is political. We were supposed to go into Seattle last week. We were told to go, then to not go. Then to go, then not. Over and over. It was ridiculous. They were trying to figure if sending more of us would ‘escalate’ the situation in Seattle. Then some wanted a ‘show of force’ and then the de-escalators would win and we’d stand down. A total joke.”</p>
   <p>Jim caught his breath and kept whispering. “So don’t worry. I’m probably better off at the potato farm. We’ll just sit around there and make sure the Hamburglar doesn’t steal the Fry Guys,” he said in a reference to the old McDonald’s cartoon characters advertising Happy Meals. Back when there were Happy Meals.</p>
   <p>That made Jeanie laugh. The Hamburglar. That was her Jim, making jokes in a tough situation. He would be OK.</p>
   <p>“So you’re not working on computers anymore,” she asked, knowing the answer. She was whispering, too.</p>
   <p>“Uh, no,” Jim said. “They don’t want a ‘POI-lover’ like me near the networks. That’s the really frustrating part,” he said getting a little choked up. “I know that system like the back of my hand. I can stop some of the hacking that’s going on and get the system back up when it goes down. They need me. But I was a Facebook friend with someone who pisses them off. So they put me on Hamburglar duty.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie laughed again. That was what Jim needed to hear. She was laughing. She wouldn’t worry. He could go now.</p>
   <p>“Gotta run, dear,” Jim said in a hurried whisper. “Love you. I’ll be fine. Tell the TV stations that the Fry Guys are safe from the Hamburglar.” He hung up.</p>
   <p>Jeanie laughed some more.</p>
   <p>And then cried. And cried and cried.</p>
   <p>She was worried about Jim. And herself. She knew that she held an ultra-high security clearance. It wouldn’t be long before she got sent on Hamburglar duty. Her career was over.</p>
   <p>But, it could even be worse. They could kick her out of Camp Murray and make her live out there with the regular people. She would have to stand in line with an FCard—if they even gave her an FCard. She might go to jail. They might…</p>
   <p>Just then Jason walked into Jeanie’s office. “Jeanie, can I talk to you?” he asked. He closed the door to her office. Here it came.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, Jason, what’s up?” she asked as cheery as possible.</p>
   <p>“Were you crying?” he asked. She had tears on her cheeks.</p>
   <p>“Allergies,” she said. It’s what she always said when she didn’t want people to know she was crying.</p>
   <p>“Jeanie, we love your work here, but we need to make some changes,” Jason said. “We’d like you to work with some of the VIPs who come out here. We’d like you to give them pep talks. We have them come to Camp Murray to get energized. It’s kind of a reward to local elected officials and others who do a good job. Hear a speech from the Governor, that kind of thing. You would be a handler of them when they get here. How does that sound?”</p>
   <p>Busted. She knew they knew about Jim and the POI thing. Maybe they knew about Jeanie socializing in the past with the WAB guys; maybe they could tell she unfriended them a while ago on Facebook. Oh well. Giving VIP tours was better than going to jail.</p>
   <p>Were they being nice to her because they liked her? Nah, Jeanie decided. They didn’t want her, with all her sensitive information, to just go out into the streets and meet up with the Patriots and spill her guts. They wanted to keep an eye on her. Where better to do that than Camp Murray? She was in the civilian version of a penal battalion, though it beat jail and it beat being out on the street.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” she said with a fake smile. “Sounds great. Put me to use where I’m needed the most.”</p>
   <p>Jason’s cell phone rang. He looked at the number and said, “Gotta go. See you around, Jeanie.”</p>
   <p>Jeanie sat in her office and cried some more. Her whole life had been on an amazing trajectory. At age twenty-eight she had been the communications director for the next governor. Now she was a suspected terrorist sympathizer and being watched. Her life seemed over.</p>
   <p>Tomorrow was her twenty-ninth birthday.</p>

    <p>(May 13)</p>
   </title>
   <p>One of the looters was attacking Grant. He drew for his pistol. He felt it. Before he could unholster it, the looter grabbed him by the shoulders and started shaking him.</p>
   <p>“Whoa! Whoa! Wake up!” the looter said as he grabbed Grant’s right arm and the pistol. Grant opened his eyes and saw Drew holding his arm. Oh God, it was only Drew.</p>
   <p>Grant was fully awake in an instant. And embarrassed. “Oh, hey, Drew, sorry. Thought you were someone else. Really sorry about that.” Grant was trying to downplay almost drawing a gun on his father–in-law.</p>
   <p>Drew was startled. “I think having a gun on your side makes sense when you’re awake,” Drew said, “but you might want to take off your pistol next time you fall asleep.” He had a point.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said. “Sorry. I fell asleep before I could take off my pistol belt or clothes.” Grant was slightly indignant that he had been awake for so long protecting people and now they were telling him how to dress for bed, but he didn’t want to hurt someone by accident. “I’ll put this on the nightstand in the future.”</p>
   <p>“The meeting is in an hour,” Drew said. “I thought we should go up there a little early, get dinner, and start planning for the meeting.” Drew had been working hard on the lists of volunteers and their contributions. The expected attack and the rush of volunteers to the gate had been a lot of work for him.</p>
   <p>Drew had several assistants. He was taking all the help he could find. He also knew that the more volunteers for keeping records about contributions, the less people could accuse Grant and his family of controlling everything. One can’t become a very successful business person like Drew without understanding basic politics.</p>
   <p>Eileen was working on the Over Road dinner, which was the dinner for those who didn’t eat routinely at the Grange. The dinner was over at the Colsons’, who were hosting it each night. They had all that deer meat in the freezer. Grant hadn’t thought much about their food out there on Over Road since he’d been eating food provided by the Grange ladies. He was glad that things seemed to be proceeding along without much of his oversight. The group meals at the Colsons were just happening on their own. A routine was settling in on Over Road.</p>
   <p>Grant was still waking up. He realized this would be yet another important meeting. He would be asking for a vote to allow the semi to be used only for emergencies. This vote had to go right. Hungry, scared people and a semi load of food? What are the odds that people would say, “No, you keep the Pop Tarts for someone who needs them more. I’ll rely on my garden first and then the Pop Tarts only as a last resort.” That might have made sense a few decades ago, but most Americans had stopped thinking about self-sufficiency a long time ago. Now they thought that food came from a semi, not a garden. But it was better to have a semi load of food and have to decide what to do with it than not have it.</p>
   <p>Grant wasn’t very talkative. He had been talking nonstop for…a day or two. He didn’t even know. Days and nights were blurring together.</p>
   <p>Grant looked for Lisa. She wasn’t home. She was probably working at the Grange. He walked outside. The bright light hurt his eyes. He put on his sunglasses.</p>
   <p>He saw the Team leaving the yellow cabin.</p>
   <p>“Hey, those are my guys,” Grant said to himself.</p>
   <p>His guys. It felt great to say that. What an amazing bunch of guys. They’d really come together as a rock solid and tight group. They’d risk their lives for each other. They already had. Bringing Lisa and the kids and the in-laws out of Olympia. Or yesterday when they ran up on Gideon’s truck and then covered each other on the retreat back to the gate.</p>
   <p>“My guys,” Grant said to himself again. There was no feeling like that in the world. The camaraderie was the only good part of the Collapse. He’d trade the camaraderie for not having a Collapse, but if there was going to be a Collapse, he was grateful he had his guys. “Grateful” was too weak of a word. There was no word for it.</p>
   <p>The Team was getting into Mark’s truck. Slowly. They were tired. Grant was glad he, in his forties, was just as tired as these twenty-somethings in great shape.</p>
   <p>“This never gets old,” Grant said as he got into the truck. They smiled.</p>
   <p>“Beats the shit out of selling insurance,” Pow said. More smiles.</p>
   <p>Armed serenity, Grant thought once again as he looked at his guys in the truck with kit and ARs. This is armed serenity. Grant absolutely loved this feeling. Sheepdogs love being sheepdogs.</p>
   <p>The Team talked a little about the preparations for the attack the day before that never materialized. They talked about which of the guards seemed to be better than others. About their extra weapons which were donated to the cause and they wanted back. Each man had been responsible for getting his loaned gear back. That reminded Grant that the Team had loaned out his A2, the standard-issue AR he had.</p>
   <p>“Hey, where’s my A2?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>“Yellow cabin,” Wes said.</p>
   <p>“Thanks, man,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>“No problemo, my brother,” Wes answered.</p>
   <p>They pulled into the Grange and the place was packed. People were standing around the semi gawking. They were thrilled about the big prize. Gideon was standing by the truck shaking hands. Everyone wanted to meet the mystery man who brought them all the food.</p>
   <p>Chip and the guards were being polite, but making sure people stayed a few yards back. Grant loved the political message the guards were sending about the semi: this thing is very valuable and your community is protecting it.</p>
   <p>Grant spent about twenty minutes chatting with people. They all had questions or wanted to tell him how glad they were about the semi. The story about the head fake was going around. Grant wanted to eat and then dive into preparing for his speech on saving the semi for emergencies but people kept talking to him. He realized that part of his job was talking to people. He didn’t mind it; he just wanted to get a lot done. That meant talking to people. Besides, he thought to himself with a chuckle, he’s running for judge so he should talk to as many voters as possible.</p>
   <p>Finally, Grant had to break away and get something to eat. Despite that giant breakfast a few hours ago, he was still hungry. The Grange ladies were serving deer burgers and potato salad. Heavy on the potatoes and light on the mayonnaise because, Grant suspected, potatoes can be grown at Pierce Point but mayonnaise must be trucked in from California. That’s fine. Grant preferred potatoes to mayonnaise, anyway.</p>
   <p>Rich had a crowd around him, too. Finally Rich came over and said, “OK, so you’ll present your plan for holding onto the semi for emergencies.”</p>
   <p>Grant nodded. His mouth was full of potato salad.</p>
   <p>“Anything else?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Grant said in between mouthfuls. “An alert system for reserve guards getting to the gate. And a transportation system.” Grant chewed some more.</p>
   <p>“And a gardening system,” Grant said. “A pretty full agenda.”</p>
   <p>Rich was in charge and was doing plenty, but he was glad Grant was around to think of things, logistical and political things, and just get them done. It took a lot off Rich’s plate.</p>
   <p>He looked at his watch, and went to the little podium and said to the crowd, “OK, let’s get started.”</p>
   <p>Rich was in charge, but in a collaborative way. He wasn’t trying to boss people around; he was guiding them and letting people take the lead on various things. He had no desire to be a dictator and it showed. At the same time, everyone knew who to come to with a problem that needed to be solved.</p>
   <p>Rich gave a briefing to everyone on the semi. He noted that the food in the semi was nonperishable so it would last for quite some time. A few years, actually. That was a key point Grant wanted to make sure people understood. There was no need to eat the food now.</p>
   <p>The cat was out of the bag about the head fake. There was no way to keep a secret out there. It would get back to Bennington that they had the semi full of food. Oh well. At least they had it.</p>
   <p>“Will the police come to get the semi when they realize it’s full of food?” Was the first question someone asked.</p>
   <p>“I doubt it,” said Rich. “The deputy I was talking to was noticing the dozens of guards, sandbag bunkers, and especially those dogs.” People looked over at Dan, who was grinning from ear to ear. “Besides, they have lots of problems on their hands in town.”</p>
   <p>Rich told the audience about the Mexican part of town being gated off and the Blue Ribbon Boys and the FC. He didn’t talk about the corruption and Commissioner Winters, but he didn’t need to. They all understood. No one really looked to the government as a neutral group there to help.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “Grant here has a proposal about the semi.”</p>
   <p>People started cheering. That was a good sign.</p>
   <p>Grant started by saying, “You can thank Gideon Armstrong.” Gideon came forward to accept the cheering. “Gideon risked a lot to give this food to us.” More cheering. Grant wished that he had talked to Gideon in advance to have Gideon tell the crowd that he wanted “his” food to be used only for emergencies. You can’t do everything perfectly. Grant had been busy preparing to fight off an attack.</p>
   <p>Grant needed the crowd to know that he had something to do with the food, too, so that his suggestion on its use would be heeded. “I’d like to thank the Team, too. We,” he made sure to use the word “we” so they knew he was involved, “rushed into potential gunfire to secure this.” More cheering. “And Mr. Smithson for his quick work to switch out the trailers like he did.” More cheering.</p>
   <p>“I have a plan,” Grant said during all the cheering, “about what to do with this food. Hold onto it for emergencies. It’s nonperishable. We don’t have to eat it now before it goes bad. It won’t go bad for a year or two, or probably even longer,” Grant said. He paused for effect.</p>
   <p>“I feel very, very strongly that we use this for emergencies only,” Grant said. “We use up our other food supplies first. We share with each other and help the elderly and disabled first. Then, if we’re out of food after that, we might dip into this semi. If, and only if, we really, really need to. But, this isn’t a dictatorship,” Grant said while staring right at Snelling. Grant was surprised to see he had shown his face at the Grange after the shellacking he took at the last meeting. “So does everyone agree to hold onto the food for emergencies?”</p>
   <p>Most people were saying, “Yes” or nodding or clapping. Most, though, not all.</p>
   <p>Someone asked, “So how exactly would this work?”</p>
   <p>Grant said, “We use up our own food first. We share among ourselves. Who here won’t share?” No one said a word. Of course not. Not in public. People would be greedy bastards in private, but usually not raise their hands to say so. Grant needed people to publicly acknowledge that they would share.</p>
   <p>“When someone is out of their own food,” Grant said, “they can get a meal card. That allows them to get one good meal a day here at the Grange. The Grange will get food by donations. The kitchen is set up to take in large amounts of food and prepare it. For example, a deer. Someone could bring one in and that becomes deer for a hundred people that day.”</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to downplay this next point, so he just squished it in between other points and said it plainly. “Those working for the community like the guards and the Grange ladies get their meals provided,” he said. Grant didn’t want people to complain that some people are getting free food. Yes, some people are. People who hold a rifle and risk their lives to protect everyone. Deer burgers and potato salad was a small price to pay for not having a motorcycle gang showing up at their doors.</p>
   <p>“We hopefully don’t have to use the semi food for the Grange meals,” Grant said. “Maybe we do. But it’s a last resort. A last, last resort.” Grant lowered his voice to make a serious point. “Winter is coming. Think about it. Winter. We need a reserve.” He let that sink in.</p>
   <p>“So back to the meal cards,” Grant said. “If you’re not working for the community, which means you’re not getting a meal card for the one meal a day, you get a meal card when your own supplies have run out. But, we need to make sure your supplies have, indeed, run out. So by taking a meal card, you agree to let us look at your place and verify that you don’t have stacks of food. That’s the only fair way to do this.” The idea of searches, even voluntary ones in exchange for food, wasn’t setting too well with everyone. So Grant made the next point that he’d been saving up.</p>
   <p>“Of course,” Grant said, “if you get a meal card, you need to do some work for the community. So if you run out of your own food, you need to start working for the community to get a meal card. It could be helping with the meal preparation. Or keeping track of the meal cards or helping keep track of all the donations. Or taking care of sick people. Or a million other things. It doesn’t have to be guard duty. Everyone out here can do something for the community. But it’s only fair that if the community is going to feed you that you do something in return.”</p>
   <p>Silence. Uh oh.</p>
   <p>“So what do you think?” Grant asked, a little timidly.</p>
   <p>More silence.</p>
   <p>“Hell of an idea,” said one guy.</p>
   <p>“Sounds good.” “Love it.” “Sounds fair.” A little clapping.</p>
   <p>Whew. Grant looked over at Snelling. He was emerging as the leader of the opposition. Grant seemed to have the votes so he thought he could take a little risk and have some fun.</p>
   <p>“Mr. Snelling? Thoughts?” Grant said in his most respectful voice.</p>
   <p>“I guess the macho men with guns,” Snelling said, “stole something and now want to control who gets it. Classic authoritarianism,” Snelling said in a calm, yet passive-aggressive voice.</p>
   <p>“Boo!” “Shut up!” “Asshole.” It was only a few people saying it. Most people just sat there waiting to see how this conflict would play out.</p>
   <p>Grant wanted to use this to knock Snelling down a few more pegs. “Let’s analyze your statement, Mr. Snelling.”</p>
   <p>A few people started laughing, knowing that Grant was about to demolish Snelling’s statement piece by piece.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “Macho men with guns? Well, yes, the Team risked getting shot to secure this for all of you. The guards, including dozens of volunteers who came streaming down to the gate, were ready to fight to the last death for this semi. And they secured it with guns because the people who stole this from Gideon—with guns—seemed to be coming here to shoot us and take the semi.”</p>
   <p>Grant let that set in and went on. “Mr. Snelling, the people who stole this from Gideon—you can ask him yourself—were your beloved Freedom Corps. Your government at work, sir.”</p>
   <p>Grant put his finger up to make a point and said, “Back to guns, though. Turns out the Freedom Corps thieves didn’t try to break into Pierce Point and shoot us, but we didn’t know that when we ran up to save Gideon. For all we know, the hijackers ran away when they saw us macho men with guns.”</p>
   <p>The crowd laughed. They loved this.</p>
   <p>“Stole?” Grant continued. “Do you want to return this to the corrupt corporation that is in bed with the government, Mr. Snelling?” Grant usually didn’t talk about politics like this to the residents, but this was such a teachable moment about soft fascism—corporations and government getting together to screw the little people—that he couldn’t resist. There was no better way to show the audience about soft fascism than a concrete example, like a semi of food that they wanted to keep for themselves.</p>
   <p>Grant decided to go for the jugular. “Go ahead, Mr. Snelling, tell everyone here that you want this food sent back to your corporate and government buddies. Then they can distribute it to themselves. Just like they’ve been taking from us and giving to themselves for years now?”</p>
   <p>More boos and jeering from the crowd. Snelling could not believe that Grant was batting him around like a mouse.</p>
   <p>“But my favorite line of yours, Mr. Snelling,” Grant said, “is that bit about ‘authoritarianism.’ How is it, again, that us asking people tonight what they want to do with the food is ‘authoritarianism’?”</p>
   <p>Cheers and applause.</p>
   <p>Grant knew what was really bothering Snelling: the meal cards. The community would control the meal cards. Actually, the threat to Snelling was that Grant would control the meal cards. But, in reality, Grant would not control them. A group of others, like Drew and anyone who wanted to help him, would actually administer the cards. But Snelling thought Grant would control the meal cards.</p>
   <p>Snelling also hated the part about having to work for the community to get the meal card. This was ironic given that Snelling, who would probably describe himself as a “progressive” in the past, went to cocktail parties in Seattle and talked about how people needed to do more for the community. Not now, when Snelling’s people weren’t the ones running things. Now doing things for the community was “authoritarianism.”</p>
   <p>Rich correctly sensed that this was a great time to take a vote. “All in favor of holding the semi in reserve for emergencies and for the meal card plan, say ‘aye.’”</p>
   <p>“Aye!” said almost the entire crowd.</p>
   <p>“Those opposed?” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“Nay,” said Snelling, his wife, and a handful of his followers.</p>
   <p>The vote was about 150 to five. Grant couldn’t believe it went that well.</p>
   <p>He wanted to make sure this thing took root. “We need as many people as possible to administer the meal cards. We are not keeping this limited to any group of people. Don’t feel like this is some inside job like the government has been. You can be involved in this and anyone at any time can see the records and watch how the process is administered.” Grant knew that when people got hungry they would start having wild conspiracy theories about preferential treatment. It was important for everyone’s impression to be that there was no favoritism.</p>
   <p>“Any other business?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>Grant raised his hand. “An alert system. Yesterday, we found out the hard way with the scare about the attack that we don’t have a way of rounding up the troops. We need one.”</p>
   <p>It was quiet. Finally, a man raised his hand.</p>
   <p>“I’m Gene Shonemaker. I will put an alert system together. Phones still work most of the time. We can have a phone tree where people call a list of other people. Maybe we could get a big horn here at the Grange to alert people to start making the calls. We’ll work it out,” he said.</p>
   <p>“Perfect,” said Grant. He not only wanted an alert system, he wanted people to start volunteering to take on things like this and show their neighbors that everyone—not just Grant and Rich—were running things out there.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “Grant, you wanted to talk about transportation.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“Yes,” Grant said. “Mobilizing the guards showed that we need a transportation system. Gas is in short supply. We need to conserve it. We can use private vehicles in an emergency, but we should really have a bus or vans or something. I see two needs here. First, to get a lot of troops around quickly. Like, if guards get alerted by Gene and then we have a bus to go into the gate. Second, we all need to get around here, especially here to the Grange which is the headquarters of all we’re doing. We should maybe have a bus service that picks up in various places and makes a regular run here. Maybe like a morning, noon, and evening run. It won’t be as frequent as we’re used to, but it will save a ton of gas and diesel.”</p>
   <p>A few hands went up. “Great,” Grant said, looking over at Rich. “Let’s get together after the meeting and you guys can start putting this thing together,” Grant said.</p>
   <p>People were amazed at how Grant seemed to be thinking of all these things. So was Grant, although it wasn’t that it was brilliant to think “we need some rides;” it was pretty obvious that they needed a transportation system. The amazing part was that Grant was just up there in front of 150 people saying, “Hey, we need a bus service. Let’s get one together,” and it was getting done.</p>
   <p>“Any other business,” Rich asked. He was tired.</p>
   <p>A woman stood up. Grant had seen her around, but didn’t know her name. She was kind of a hippie looking lady in her fifties or sixties with a touch of gray in her hair. “We need to have some organized gardening,” she said.</p>
   <p>“Your name, ma’am?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, Betty Norris out on Anderson Road.” Rich motioned for her to go ahead.</p>
   <p>“I’ve been growing food out here for years,” she said. “I’m happy to help anyone who needs it.”</p>
   <p>A murmur went up. It sounded like a lot of people needed some gardening help. Betty smiled. She loved helping people.</p>
   <p>Betty also felt a little vindicated. For years, people wondered why the crazy hippy lady grew her own food when there was perfectly good food just sitting there at the grocery store. Betty was concerned about food additives and started growing a few fruits and vegetables. Then she realized how much better homegrown food tasted. Then, when the economy went into the crapper, she realized how much money she was saving. There was no looking back. Each year, she added more and more crops to her garden, which, at over an acre was actually more of a small farm than a “garden.”</p>
   <p>“I have seeds you can use,” Betty said. “They’re tested and they grow great out here.” She smiled. She had been saving seeds for just an occasion like this. Not that she was a “survivalist,” but she just thought it would be a good idea to have some seeds. It wasn’t much work to save them and she knew—she just knew—that others would need them.</p>
   <p>“How would you like to proceed?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh, I don’t know,” Betty said. “People can just talk to me after the meeting. Maybe we can have some classes here in the mornings. Then people can come out to my place and see what I’m talking about and get some seeds.” What an extraordinary offer she was making.</p>
   <p>Grant had always expected people to be extremely greedy when the Collapse happened. There was some of that, even in Pierce Point, but there was more generosity than greed. Whether she knew it or not, Betty was exposing herself to possible theft by telling people she had all that food. Then again, the full time residents probably knew she grew all that food already. She had probably given them tomatoes and other things for years. But still, it was a big risk to raise her hand during the Collapse and say, “I have tons of food. Come to my house and see.”</p>
   <p>Grant made a mental note to talk to Betty about having a guard out at her house. Maybe a gardening guard, a person who wanted to help her with the teaching and seed sharing—and who was well armed. That was the least the community could do for Betty.</p>
   <p>Rich didn’t want the meeting to bog down on the details of Betty’s gardening so he said, “OK, after the meeting come and see Betty to volunteer. Thank you so much, Betty. Really. This is great.”</p>
   <p>Betty blushed. She was so proud. She was so glad to be helping and not be the crazy “organic” lady anymore.</p>
   <p>When Rich asked if there were any more topics for discussion, Mary Anne raised her hand. “Mrs. Roth’s funeral will be tomorrow at 2:00 p.m. Here in the Grange.”</p>
   <p>She paused. She looked embarrassed and uncomfortable when she said, “We actually buried her yesterday when everyone was at the gate expecting trouble. We don’t have any embalming fluid, so we needed to. But we will have a service remembering her life and—for those of you who didn’t know her—tell the amazing story of her life. I know most of you didn’t really know her, but you should come to this for yourself. You will learn so much about…yourself. Sounds weird, doesn’t it? But, you will. You’ll see what a life well lived is all about and how we’re only here for a short while.”</p>
   <p>Everyone clapped. Not only was Mrs. Roth’s legacy those fabulous canning supplies, which would feed lots of people in the coming months, but her death would help bring people at Pierce Point together. She would have been proud. Grant felt like she could see what was happening down in Pierce Point and was very happy.</p>
   <p>Mary Anne had some papers in her hand. She started passing them out. “This is the first edition,” she said, “of the <emphasis>Pierce Point Patriot</emphasis>, our newspaper. That’s right: our newspaper. Thanks to Ken Dolphson for getting this put together and making the copies. We only made a few copies since we might run out of copy paper and not be able to get more for a while. So please read it and share it with a neighbor.”</p>
   <p>People were looking at the sheet of paper as she spoke. They were impressed with it. A newspaper; their very own. Having their own little tiny newspaper was one more way to help secure the community feeling that was developing. Instead of reading a Seattle or Olympia newspaper, which didn’t really relate directly to them, they were reading a Pierce Point newspaper. It was all about them. People went to great effort to produce a newspaper just for them.</p>
   <p>Grant was anxious to see the paper. It was well done. This first edition was all about Mrs. Roth, as it should have been. Sure enough, Ken had put a “Don’t Tread on Me” on the top of the paper by the words “Pierce Point Patriot.” Grant heard Snelling groan as he read it. Snelling understood the significance of that “Don’t Tread on Me” on the paper.</p>
   <p>Good. Let Snelling realize he was being out organized here. This wasn’t Snelling’s little weekend getaway where a bunch of rednecks unfortunately lived. No, Pierce Point was a Patriot stronghold, whether they realized it yet or not.</p>
   <p>Snelling crumbled up the paper and stormed out with his handful of supporters. It was like some high school thing where a clique of kids couldn’t stand everyone else. It was very immature. But Grant was glad they were acting this way.</p>
   <p>After a while, as the meeting was finally winding down, Lisa came over to Grant. She was tired, too. People were coming up to her to meet the doctor. She was a popular person at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>Finally, she broke away and said to Grant, “Hey, we need some medical supplies. Like, badly. I didn’t want to say anything publicly tonight because that would make people lose confidence in the clinic, but we need supplies.”</p>
   <p>As Lisa said that, Rich and Cindy, the nurse, heard it and came up to them.</p>
   <p>“Yes, we do,” said Cindy. She had a clipboard and waved it around. “I have a list.”</p>
   <p>Rich took a look at the list. He pulled Grant over and whispered, “I have an idea.” Rich told Grant his idea. Grant realized why Rich was whispering.</p>
   <p>Grant said to Lisa and Cindy, “We’ll get back with you tomorrow morning on this, Cindy. Would you be able to come into town tomorrow and help us get these? You’d have an extremely well-armed escort, of course.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, OK,” Cindy said. She hadn’t really wanted to go into town, well-armed escort or not, but she could see that they needed someone with medical expertise to get the supplies. Lisa could do it, but it was Cindy’s list and, besides, they might need a doctor that day and could live without a nurse right then. Cindy was spearheading the medical supplies issue. Grant admitted to himself that another reason to have Cindy instead of Lisa go into town was that Grant didn’t want Lisa to get killed. Cindy was nice and all, but…</p>
   <p>Grant knew he needed to talk to Chip for Rich’s plan to work. He went outside and talked to Chip. It took a while, but Chip eventually agreed. Grant went back in and told Rich the plan would work. Rich smiled.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 133</p>
    <p><emphasis>The Legend of Pierce Point</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Grant got up at about 7:00 a.m. that morning, which felt like sleeping in. He felt rested, a feeling he hadn’t had in a while. He had a light day ahead of him for the first time since he got out there. He needed it. All these all-nighters, stress, and runnin’ and gunnin’ was wearing him out.</p>
   <p>He got up and started making pancakes. He wanted to give Eileen and the others who had been making breakfast for the past few days a little break. Not that they minded doing it, he just wanted to show his thanks by doing it for them.</p>
   <p>Grant loved the smell of those pancakes. He took several deep breaths and savored the smell. It wasn’t just that they smelled good and he was hungry. It was that he had pancake mix out there and he had his family to cook for. He had prepared for this and—by some miracle—his family was out there. He had written them off when he first got out there. He had mentally decided that he would spend the rest of his life without them because they wouldn’t come out. Now they were sleeping in his beloved cabin and he was making them pancakes. What could be better?</p>
   <p>His family started stirring. First Eileen, and then Drew. Eileen helped with breakfast and Drew made coffee. Grant, who didn’t drink much coffee, was very glad he brought out plenty of coffee and filters before the Collapse. He knew that coffee had a civilizing effect on people. A morning cup of coffee was a pre-Collapse routine. Having a cup out there was a connection to the pre-Collapse “normal.” That was very important.</p>
   <p>Grant had always hated normalcy bias, but there were parts of “normal” that were healthy and beneficial. A morning cup of coffee reminded people of the past when things were good and gave them hope that even during this stressful time, these things of comfort were still available. Not everything had changed; that was reassuring. They would have coffee through this and enjoy it after things got better.</p>
   <p>The Morrells and Colsons came over. Missy Colson was playing with Cole, and Manda was watching over them. That was working well. It seemed that Manda had grown up in the past few weeks, nearly overnight. It was remarkable to see her—who Grant remembered just a few short years ago playing like little Missy—now being the teenager in charge.</p>
   <p>The Team came over, too. Ryan was now fully integrated with them, which was good. He was staying out at the yellow cabin with the rest of the Team. They were a tight-knit group, so it wasn’t easy to quickly fit in, but Ryan, a combat Marine, had the respect of the guys, so it worked well.</p>
   <p>Wes came in and smelled the pancakes. “I loves me some pancakes,” he said in that rich southern drawl of his. “I bet you the last meal I eat will be pancakes.”</p>
   <p>That statement struck Grant. For some reason, Grant thought Wes might be right. Grant thought it was superstitious, but he kept thinking pancakes would be Wes’s last meal. He couldn’t shake that thought.</p>
   <p>The last guy to come over was Chip. When he came to the door, Chip signaled Grant to join him outside. Grant knew that they had business to conduct.</p>
   <p>When they got outside and away from everyone, Chip said, “OK, let’s do this.” Chip had the keys to the downstairs unfinished basement in his hand. He was holding the keys like they were gold coins. They were. They were the keys to something worth more than gold: guns and ammo.</p>
   <p>Grant motioned for Chip to lead the way down to the unfinished basement. Chip went down the stairs to it. When Chip got to the door, he paused. He looked at Grant and said, “How bad do we need those medical supplies?”</p>
   <p>“Real bad,” Grant said. Chip smiled. He knew it was true. Chip wasn’t greedy, he just wanted to make sure the sacrifice he was about to make was worth it. It was.</p>
   <p>Chip opened the door to the unfinished basement. It was dark in there, so he turned on the light. There they were. Boxes and boxes of guns. Cases of ammo stacked neatly. Boxes of magazines. Several scopes and red-dot sights. Several handgun cases, mostly Glocks. Leaning on the wall were AKs and tactical shotguns with a “Don’t Tread on Me” flag partially covering them from view. On the bench were Chip’s gunsmithing tools.</p>
   <p>Chip looked at all the guns. They were his “babies.” He loved every one of them. Grant knew that what Chip was about to do would be hard, but he would still gladly do it.</p>
   <p>Chip started checking the labels on the ends of the boxes. “How about standard M4s? Carry handles and standard handguards?”</p>
   <p>Granted nodded. “Yeah, we don’t need to give out the good stuff.” About half of Chip’s guns were the fancier models with flat tops and rails for mounting optics and other accessories, like lights. The standard M4s didn’t have those features. They were general issue military carbines, except they weren’t fully automatic. They were great guns, just not all tricked out.</p>
   <p>Chip selected two gun boxes and handed them to Grant. Chip went to one of the big boxes of magazines and pulled out twenty standard aluminum magazines. He tested each follower to make sure it worked. They all did. He handed each magazine to Grant after he tested it. Grant found an empty box to put them in. Then Chip went over to the ammo stack, looked at the label and turned to Grant and asked, “A full case of 5.56? Really? Ouch.”</p>
   <p>Grant just nodded.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Chip said. He grabbed a full case—1,000 rounds—of 5.56. It was heavy and he was in his sixties, so he lifted it slowly. He brought the case over to the two gun boxes and the magazine box Grant had over by him.</p>
   <p>Grant looked at the guns, ammo, and magazines and said, “Thanks, man. Seriously. This is a life-saving thing you’re doing.”</p>
   <p>Chip smiled. “Oh, I know. That’s why I’m doing it.”</p>
   <p>Grant motioned that he would go outside and make sure no one was looking. He trusted everyone upstairs with his life, but…he still didn’t want anyone to know that they had enough guns, ammo, and magazines to outfit about forty fighters. That’s just not something to share. Until it’s time. And it wasn’t time yet.</p>
   <p>Grant went out into the daylight and saw that no one was around. He came back in and grabbed a couple of beach towels and motioned for Chip to bring the guns out. They went to Mark’s truck and put them in the bed. Grant covered them with the beach towels. Next, came the box of magazines and the case of ammo, which Grant carried. They all fit under the towels. Grant put some pieces of firewood on the towels to keep them on.</p>
   <p>Grant said to Chip, “Hey, man, you go have yourself some pancakes. You’ve earned them. I’ll hang out here. Then tell Mark we need his keys to take something up to the Grange. Tell him to enjoy breakfast. We got this all by ourselves. You can have someone at the Grange run the truck back to him later this morning.”</p>
   <p>Grant took this opportunity to sit and just take in the sun and nature out there. God, it was beautiful that May morning. Birds chirping. Sunny and warm with a slight breeze. Nature was still its beautiful self, right in the middle of all the human chaos.</p>
   <p>A few minutes later, Chip came out with Mark’s keys. He had his AR slung across his chest, a paper plate of pancakes in his hands, and a plastic fork in his mouth. It was the oddest thing Grant had ever seen, but it made perfect sense.</p>
   <p>Chip got in the bed of the truck and Grant started up the engine. Chip was busy keeping the firewood on the towels, balancing his AR, and working on those pancakes. How a guy could simultaneously sit in the bed of truck and do all that at the same time was unclear, but Chip was doing it.</p>
   <p>It was almost 8:00 a.m. when they pulled into the Grange. Perfect. That’s when they were supposed to meet Rich, but his truck was already in the parking lot.</p>
   <p>“You finish up those pancakes and guard the goodies,” Grant said to Chip, who nodded. Grant went in and saw Rich. He motioned for him to come out. Rich came to the truck and looked in the bed. Chip pulled the towels back and showed Rich what they had brought. Rich smiled.</p>
   <p>Grant said, “Rich, I love you man, but I’m not telling you where these came from. These were hidden.” Grant was trying to imply that these two ARs were all he had. “I can’t say who I got them from, but I did. Legally. Well, to the extent anything is legal. You know what I mean. I didn’t steal these.”</p>
   <p>Rich understood. He wasn’t offended that Grant didn’t disclose where he got them. Rich assumed they were extras the Team had, though it was odd that the Team would have extra guns in their factory boxes like this. Oh well. Rich didn’t think about it too much. He was just glad they had them.</p>
   <p>“Great,” Rich said. “Thanks, gentlemen. Let’s get these in my truck with those towels on them. Grant, you should watch them. Chip needs to get the day Grange guard organized and operating.” Chip gave Rich a friendly salute and hopped out of the bed of the truck. He took his syrup-soaked pancake plate and put it in the garbage. He went off and started getting the day guards together. It was work time.</p>
   <p>Grant sat in the back of Rich’s truck and chatted with people. They offered him breakfast. He’d already eaten some pancakes, but he took some more breakfast. He could never predict when he might miss a meal, or two.</p>
   <p>A volunteer, a teenager Grant had met down at the gate, came up to Grant and asked for the keys to Mark’s truck. He said he was going to pick up the Team and Mark so Mark could drive the truck back. Grant handed him the keys.</p>
   <p>Grant stayed in Rich’s truck chatting with people. About a half hour later, the Team arrived in full kit, as usual. Since they didn’t know the source of the guns, it was OK to tell them what was going on. As soon as they got settled, Grant told someone to send the Team out to Rich’s truck. They came out and saw Grant sitting in the bed of the truck, which was odd. Grant looked around to make sure no one else saw them. He motioned for them to come closer.</p>
   <p>Grant whispered, “We have two ARs to sell in town. Don’t ask where they came from. I didn’t steal them.” The Team was very surprised to see Grant had some ARs. They all started to wonder how he got them. They weren’t coming up with any answers.</p>
   <p>Knowing that they would be wondering where the ARs came from, Grant said, “Community donations.” That was true, just not the whole story. They were Chip’s community donations, but were still “community donations.” Grant couldn’t lie to the Team, but he felt OK telling them part of the truth when it was necessary.</p>
   <p>“We’re going into town to buy us some medical supplies and,” Grant winked at Rich, “something else that you’ll see later.” Rich smiled.</p>
   <p>Grant continued. “I’d like Pow and Ryan to come with Rich and Cindy, the nurse. I can’t go because of that POI thing. And Wes…well, some Mexicans are looking for a white dude with an AK underfolder right now, so he’s out.” Wes was embarrassed, but still smiling.</p>
   <p>“I chose Pow and Ryan for a couple of reasons,” Grant said. “I want Pow because he’s Asian. He’ll stand out in a crowd there in Frederickson. I want people there talking about ‘that SEAL-looking Asian dude. Don’t mess with Pierce Point.’ I want kind of a signature thing and Pow’s ‘ninja’ bad-assness is perfect.” Pow was smiling and very proud that his “ninja bad-assness” was a selling point.</p>
   <p>“I also want Ryan because he’s a local,” Grant said. “I want the Frederickson people to know that Ryan and Rich out at Pierce Point have recruited some stranger badass support. Something exotic. And a six-foot Korean in full kit fits the bill.” The guys were patting Pow on the back and laughing.</p>
   <p>“Why not take us all as a show of force?” Bobby asked.</p>
   <p>“Good question,” Grant said. “That was my first idea, but we need plenty of the Team back here to deal with anything that might come up while they’re gone. We don’t want to put all our eggs in one basket. While we have reason to believe our little shopping party won’t be arrested,” Grant again looked at Rich, who smiled back, “we would only lose a few of our Team—but not all—if that happened.” Bobby nodded, satisfied with the answer.</p>
   <p>Grant pointed to the packages under the towels. “Not a word about these. Not to anyone. We do not need people knowing that we have extra ARs or people speculating that we have more. Seriously. Not a word.”</p>
   <p>“What ARs?” Scotty said.</p>
   <p>“Don’t see nuthin’,” Wes said, pretending to be the stereotypical dumb southerner.</p>
   <p>“Exactly,” Grant said as he looked at his watch. That was another new thing in Grant’s life: a watch. Pre-Collapse he always used his cell phone to keep track of time. Now he didn’t use his cell phone because he could be tracked by it. So he dug out his old Timex, which still worked perfectly well. He was quickly getting used to it being on his wrist. With all the coordination of plans requiring him to be places at certain times, he had to have a watch.</p>
   <p>“Rich, Pow, and Ryan will meet Cindy here at 9:00 a.m., which is in twenty minutes. The rest of you will get the day’s jobs from Dan, who I think will have you guys down at the gate today training some of the new guards. I will be going to Mrs. Roth’s funeral at noon and working on administrative things, like the meal cards. Tomorrow, when the full Team is back, we’ll resume our visits to the residents. Any questions?”</p>
   <p>Everyone shook their heads.</p>
   <p>“Okely dokely,” Grant said, imitating Ned Flanders of the Simpsons. “Let’s go to work.” The group broke up and went into the Grange to talk to Dan.</p>
   <p>Pow and Ryan went over their gear with Grant. Pow had his body armor plates in a load bearing vest which had magazine pouches all over it. He carried four double AR magazine pouches, which was 240 rounds, plus the thirty rounds in his carbine. Well, actually 252, since Pow and the Team only loaded a magazine with twenty-eight rounds instead of thirty to prevent any feeding malfunctions, which were extremely rare. But still. Why not take out the possibility of a malfunction when your life depended on the gun going bang? Pow also had four seventeen-round Glock pistol magazines in two double-mag pouches and one mag in his pistol. He had a fairly large first aid kit on the back of his kit. And his Camelbak water bladder. Lots of guys thought ammo was more important than water, but a person drinks several times a day and almost never fires their gun. Which was more important?</p>
   <p>Pow also had Grant’s Gerber LMF knife hanging upside down on the webbing of his left shoulder, his non-firing shoulder. Normally, Pow didn’t carry a knife on his kit because he wasn’t trained at knife fighting and didn’t want to pull a knife on someone, not know how to use it, and get it taken away only to be used on him. Grant was the same way, almost never carrying anything other than his Zero Tolerance folding knife. But, Grant had brought his thoroughly badass Gerber LMF along knowing that he needed to “dress up” Pow for an extra badass appearance. It was a little bit of theater. With his sunglasses, 5.11s, and combat boots, Pow looked like a military contractor. Perfect. Let the rumors fly about the professional gun fighters out at Pierce Point. It wasn’t true, of course, but that was a false impression that was good to have out there.</p>
   <p>Ryan was using extra kit borrowed from various Team members. Ryan, who was still in Marine shape from his recent return from Afghanistan, looked plenty badass himself. He was wearing his Marine camouflage-pattern pants, a black tee shirt, and boots.</p>
   <p>Rich handed a handheld CB to Pow and Ryan. “These are more for show. I don’t think we’ll need them, but I want the Frederickson boys to think we’re all equipped with these.”</p>
   <p>“Why not the ham radios?” Ryan asked. “I mean, they’re way more high speed than CBs.”</p>
   <p>“Because I don’t want people in town to know that we have hams,” Rich said. “Ham is the way we do our sensitive communications. If they know we have them, they might start trying to listen in on those frequencies. Let them listen in all they want on CB, which is where we say routine things. But also let them think we have tons of handheld CBs out here, which we don’t. This trip is as much about starting the legend of Pierce Point as it is getting medical supplies.”</p>
   <p>Cindy came out to the Rich’s truck. She had a clipboard and several garbage bags in which to bring things back.</p>
   <p>“Good morning,” Ryan said to her.</p>
   <p>“Morning,” she said, nervously. She was scared. She knew town was dangerous. Really dangerous. She was glad she had an extremely well-armed escort, but she was still scared. She really didn’t want to be doing this, but she knew she had to.</p>
   <p>Ryan made a facial gesture to Pow and Rich that Cindy needed to be made comfortable. They nodded. They would ease Cindy’s mind.</p>
   <p>Cindy got in the cab with Rich. Pow and Ryan got in the back of the truck and opened the rear window to the cab so they could talk to Rich and Cindy. They started down the road toward the gate. The guys began to banter about the weather and all the things they were going to do in a few hours when they came back—safely, of course.</p>
   <p>“What are the Grange ladies serving up for lunch?” Ryan asked.</p>
   <p>“Dunno, man,” Pow said, “but I hope it’s those deer burgers. And, damn, that potato salad. Hey, Cindy, you had that potato salad?”</p>
   <p>She nodded. “It’s good,” she added. She was relaxing a little. She hadn’t slept the night before worrying about going into town. Not just about danger to herself, but about seeing all the horrible things going on in town. She wasn’t sure she was prepared for it.</p>
   <p>Just before they got to the gate, Cindy asked, “Did you guys bring money? How are we paying for these?”</p>
   <p>Rich pointed toward the back of the truck and said, “We have something much better than money. You’ll see.” Rich realized that they hadn’t told Cindy the plan yet so it was no wonder she was nervous. Just going to town without money would be a scary thing.</p>
   <p>“We have some valuables to trade for the medical supplies,” Rich said, pointing toward the back of the truck. “Then we’ll meet someone who will, shall we say, cut the red tape for us and take us to someone who has medical supplies for sale. Don’t worry. We have this thing well planned.”</p>
   <p>Cindy relaxed some more. She thought Rich had done plenty of things right in the past and seemed to know what he was doing. She was reassured they had a plan and something to trade for the medical supplies.</p>
   <p>Rich got on the CB. “Bennington, leaving now. See you at the rendezvous in about five minutes.” Pow’s and Ryan’s CB’s echoed with this. They were all on the same channel. Of course.</p>
   <p>“OK. See you soon,” the other voice, which must be Bennington, said.</p>
   <p>Rich’s truck came up to the gate. Ryan made sure the towels were over the packages. The guards seemed puzzled when the guys and Cindy didn’t get out of the truck to be at the guard station. Were they going into town?</p>
   <p>“Gotta do some errands,” Rich said with a smile to Dan, who knew the plan. Dan shouted, “Let them through.” The steel-pole gate swung open and out they went. It was scary to be leaving the safety of Pierce Point. The guys were mildly scared, but wouldn’t admit it. Cindy was terrified, but was trying to calm herself down.</p>
   <p>They went across the bridge and turned down the road to Frederickson. Rich, trying to ease the tension, looked at his gas gauge and said, “Full tank.” He had been getting fuel donated to him from various neighbors with gallon gas cans of gas siphoned from vehicles they no longer drove. Cindy nodded. One less thing to worry about, she thought.</p>
   <p>She finally admitted it to herself. It wasn’t getting shot or even dying that she worried about. It was getting raped. That word was so ugly. She hated to even think it, so she didn’t. She thought about getting caught by a group of men, but then her thinking cut off and went back to the beginning when she got caught. She could never complete the thought about what would happen after getting caught. She couldn’t. She was starting to grip the clipboard hard. Rich could tell she was really scared.</p>
   <p>Rich gently put his hand on the clipboard and said, “We’re all scared, but we’ll be fine. I do this kind of thing for a living. I’ve come home every time.” He looked away from the road and directly at her and said, “You have three extremely good gunfighters working for you. We’re way better than any of the punks in town. Seriously. We know what we’re doing. We have a plan and, as you’ll see, help from ‘friends.’ We’re good at this, just like you’re good at nursing.” He wanted to change her thinking from guns to nursing, which was, after all, why they were going into town. Well, the medical supplies were one of the two reasons they were going into town.</p>
   <p>About a mile after the Pierce Point gate, Rich slowed down before a gas station. It had a sign up that said, “NO GAS” and looked like it had been looted. There was a police car there.</p>
   <p>Cindy was alarmed. The men in the truck had guns that were illegal—especially those Army-looking guns—and now they were letting the police see them?</p>
   <p>“Part of the plan,” Rich said with a smile. “You’ll see.” Even though Cindy was about to see what was going on, Rich had secrecy so drilled into him that he didn’t want to tell her even a minute in advance. That made no sense, but it was how he was.</p>
   <p>Rich said to the guys in the back, “Rendezvous. Keep your eyes open for more than one guy, though.” Rich didn’t want his cargo to get stolen. He basically trusted Bennington, but he couldn’t be too sure in this climate. In many ways, this rendezvous was the most dangerous part of the trip into town.</p>
   <p>Pow and Ryan scanned. There was no one around, unless the bad guys had snipers on the roof of the gas station, and the shot angle wouldn’t work too well if they did. Rich saw that there was apparently only one cop in the car. Good.</p>
   <p>He pulled up alongside the police car. The cop waved. Rich said, “Mornin’ John.” Rich tapped on the back window.</p>
   <p>Pow and Ryan jumped out and started sweeping the area with their ARs. They looked extremely professional and intimidating. Good.</p>
   <p>This startled Bennington, but he realized that they had every right to be taking security precautions. He acted like it was no big deal even though it was jarring.</p>
   <p>Rich said to Cindy, “Stay in here. We’ll be back in a minute.” She nodded. She had the feeling that this was actually all well planned. She didn’t know exactly what was going to happen, but she knew it was well planned. That alone was comforting.</p>
   <p>Rich got out of his truck and came over to the cop car door and Bennington got out.</p>
   <p>Rich shook his hand and smiled. “Nice to see you again, John.”</p>
   <p>“Nice to see you, too,” Bennington said.</p>
   <p>Rich walked to the back of the truck and lifted up the towels. “Well, John, just like we talked about on the radio last night,” Rich smiled, “it seems that I have two AR-15s, ten magazines, and a full case of 5.56 to ‘turn in’ to the authorities. All those items being illegal and all, I wanted to do my civic duty and get them to you for safekeeping.”</p>
   <p>Bennington wasn’t thinking this was as funny as Rich was. Bennington was actually ashamed of what he was doing. It wasn’t funny to Bennington.</p>
   <p>Bennington said curtly, “Yeah, thanks.” He opened the AR boxes and looked at the guns. He counted the magazines and tested one of them by pushing in on the follower. It seemed to work. Everything seemed to be in order.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Bennington said to Rich, “help me put these in my trunk.” Bennington was looking around, not for attackers, but for anyone to see him doing something so dirty. Taking a bribe. Kind of. And doing his job. Kind of.</p>
   <p>Rich started to help Bennington put the cargo into the trunk. Pow and Ryan were scanning the area from cover. Bennington looked over at them and said to Rich, “How many of these kind of guys you got in Pierce Point?”</p>
   <p>Rich would be an idiot to give an accurate answer. So, instead, he said, “Oh, several squads.” He intentionally used a military term like “squad,” implying that the fighters at Pierce Point had some military structure.</p>
   <p>“What?” Bennington asked, completely surprised.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah,” Rich said very convincingly, “Ryan, there,” he said pointing at Ryan, “just came back from Afghanistan. A bunch of his Marine buddies were out of work. So a couple weeks ago they came to live with him. I don’t even know how many, but there’s dozens. They talk about a ‘Squad Five’ so I guess there’s five squads and that’s, what, fifty men?” Rich was loving this. He made a mental note to do some CB chatter back when he was at Pierce Point saying things like “Squad Three Leader, this is Squad Five Leader” to make the charade a little more real. They would assign a person to be a specific “squad leader” so there would be a consistent voice associated with that title. There was a good chance he didn’t need to do that because the cops probably weren’t listening to the CBs, but it was easy enough to throw a few of those “squad” references in every once in a while. They would also use fake squad references on the ham frequencies since the FC might be listening to that.</p>
   <p>Rich continued, “And another guy living in Pierce Point was a military contractor in Iraq and Afghanistan with Blackwater or whatever they’re called now. He had about a dozen of his contractor buddies come live with him like this guy,” Rich said pointing to Pow, who was scanning the area with his AR from behind the cover of the pickup bed. Bennington remembered seeing a six-foot Korean guy with full kit and some other contractor-looking guys when he came to the gate. So that explained who they were, Bennington thought.</p>
   <p>“I guess we’re lucky to have them,” Rich said with a shrug. “All nice young guys. ‘Sir’ and ‘ma’am’ to everyone. They follow orders and, when they’re not guarding or patrolling, they are working hard on gardens and things like that. Real nice to have them,” Rich said matter of factly as he was loading the last box into Bennington’s trunk.</p>
   <p>Bennington asked, “So do all these guys have ARs?” It was pretty obvious that Bennington was gathering intelligence, so Rich thought he’d fully load him up with false information to take back to Commissioner Winters and the FC.</p>
   <p>Rich hadn’t thought of the answer to the AR question because he was making up the fifty Marines and dozen contractors story.</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah,” Rich said, “they all have personal weapons. ARs, mostly, of varying kinds. Dunno where they got them. Never really asked.” Rich remembered seeing photos of contractors with AKs so he said, “Some of the contractors run AKs. I guess they learned to like them over there.”</p>
   <p>Rich added, “You know, John, I never knew how many vets we had out at Pierce Point until they all started volunteering. You saw some of them at the gate. Every branch is represented. And those good ole’ boys and girls out at Pierce Point have guns galore. ARs, AKs, M1As, mini-14s, you name it. We have stacks, literally stacks,” Rich motioned with his hand to show a waist-high stack “of hunting rifles and shotguns. And pistols. It seems like everyone has a pistol. Those guns came out of the woodwork. You know how gun sales have been the past couple of years. Well, people in Pierce Point were the ones buying them off the shelves and now they’re being put to good use. Yep, lots of good ol’ boys and girls out at Pierce Point. We’re much better off than city people. Most everyone is self-reliant, to one degree or another, out here.”</p>
   <p>This wasn’t entirely true, but Rich wanted to create the impression with the authorities that Pierce Point was on its own. Not a threat and not needing anything. Just there, but not to be messed with.</p>
   <p>Bennington had already determined that if Rich was telling the truth then Pierce Point would take a much larger force than the police had. Taking down Pierce Point would be impossible. But, anticipating his boss Commissioner Witners’ next question, Bennington wanted to find out if there was enough loot in Pierce Point to justify asking for some military help to go get it. So Bennington pointed to an AR in a box and asked Rich, “How many more of these do you got?”</p>
   <p>“This is it,” Rich said, knowing that he didn’t want to say there was a treasure chest out at Pierce Point to be taken. Besides, for all Rich knew, these were all the extra ARs Grant had out there. “These were a couple extras one of the hunter guys had. He bought them for an investment in the run up to the Crisis,” Rich was using the politically correct term with Bennington. “So this is it as far as extra ARs go out there.”</p>
   <p>Rich realized that he could oversell the (false) capabilities of the Pierce Point “troops.” He didn’t want to create the impression with the authorities that Pierce Point was a powerful and rogue force that would threaten them. He wanted the rumor to be that Pierce Point would be a good trading partner, but not a threat.</p>
   <p>So Rich added, “John, I’m really proud of how the troops out at Pierce Point are conducting themselves. They listen to me. For example, I told them that we need to trade some guns for medical supplies with you guys in town and they were all for it.” Rich winked at Bennington said, “It’s kinda cool to be in command of all these guys.”</p>
   <p>Rich decided to emphasize this next point so he looked Bennington right in the eye and said, “We’ll just do our own thing out there until this calms down. You won’t have any trouble from us.”</p>
   <p>Bennington nodded. That’s what he wanted to know. He wasn’t sure he believed Rich, but at least he could report this back to Commissioner Winters.</p>
   <p>Rich could tell Bennington was mentally preparing bullet points for his intel report to Commissioner Winters. Fifty fully equipped Marines, a dozen contractors, and lots of well-armed vets and hunters, but no treasure trove of extra ARs. Controllable troops under the leadership of someone they knew, like Rich. Pierce Point was pretty much self-sufficient, wanted to be left alone, and had plenty of force to repel a raid. That was the perfect impression to leave with Bennington.</p>
   <p>Now that Rich had delivered his end of the bargain, it was time for Bennington to deliver on his end. Rich said to Bennington, “So, just to be clear, I have safe passage into and around town now, right?”</p>
   <p>Bennington nodded. He really hated acknowledging the bribe, but it was how things were. “Yes. I’ve briefed my people that you and the people with you have safe passage when you come to town. That’s what one of the ARs was for. You’re Rich, the ex-cop, so people know you and recognize you. I’ll be with you this morning and make introductions. They will give you a safe-passage ID.”</p>
   <p>“I won’t always be making the runs,” Rich said. “I’m running Pierce Point. Can my ID be transferrable to others?”</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Bennington said. “The IDs are a piece of cloth in a particular pattern that can’t be duplicated. So the holder of the cloth has safe passage.”</p>
   <p>“Can I start getting my people into town and registering for FCards?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Sure,” Bennington said. “Commissioner Winters encourages it.”</p>
   <p>Rich was still amazed that there was at least some food in the stores. After the first two weeks with bare shelves, he assumed there would never be any again. It was a logical assumption.</p>
   <p>But, somehow the government managed to get a trickle of food out to the stores. Forcibly taking over the trucking system and all the diesel fuel was what it took. And, as inept as they were, once the United States government decided to do one thing, they had enormous resources to pull it off.</p>
   <p>The government learned some lessons from the Mexican refugee crisis. It no longer worried about environmental approvals; it just took food and shipped it. The trickle of food to the rural areas started to pick up. It would never be like before the Collapse, but it picked up. It was a “pretty much enough” level.</p>
   <p>Rich knew that the FCards were just a supplement—a pretty big supplement—to the food that they were getting on their own out at Pierce Point via stored food, hunting and fishing, and gardening. So, Pierce Point wouldn’t be dependent on the FCards like the people in the cities, but the FCards would help.</p>
   <p>Rich was a Patriot and despised the FCard system, but that didn’t mean he wouldn’t use it to feed his people. As long as they weren’t dependent on the FCards, they were fine. That’s what it was all about: dependence. If you’re not dependent, you don’t have to do the other things the government wanted in return.</p>
   <p>Rich realized that he couldn’t have all his residents come into town to register for FCards. They would be asked about the fifty Marines and say, “What Marines?” He needed to have only a small group of trusted people who knew the story to go into town.</p>
   <p>“Hey, John,” Rich said to Bennington, “I can’t be hauling hundreds of people into town to register for FCards. I don’t have the gas to bring all of them in. And they’re doing work like gardening and hunting. The logistics of getting everyone organized and into town is too much for us. Could we…”</p>
   <p>Bennington knew what he was going to ask and interrupted him with the answer. “Yep, we can give you applications to take back. Just bring them back. We don’t need to see the people applying,” Bennington said. There were a couple reasons for this.</p>
   <p>First, the government didn’t have the resources to process all these in person. They just issued “basic” cards when they didn’t know the person. That is, a normal person got the basic card which had a smaller amount on it. People who were “critical,” which meant politically connected, got increased amounts which took more processing. Commissioner Winters’ people would just take all the applications and give out generic basic FCards. They weren’t tied to a particular person. They were like a $1,000 dollar bill: each person got one. Simple to administer.</p>
   <p>Second, there was quickly massive corruption in the FCard program. Winters was creating false applications and selling those extra FCards, so the whole thing was riddled with imprecision, and that’s how Winters liked it. It would be no big deal to send hundreds of applications home with Rich and give him hundreds of basic FCards. Who cares if the people really existed or if they qualified. It was like voter registration in the run up to the Collapse. The more the merrier, and no one really knew who signed up. And no one had an incentive to care.</p>
   <p>Rich was surprised that getting FCards was this easy. What a scam. FCards would be a huge boost to their food situation, he thought. They could have a daily run into town and get things. Not too much stuff, and not enough to live on, but some.</p>
   <p>The FCard discussion brought up the topic of paying for things. Bennington paused. He really hated saying these things, but he had to.</p>
   <p>“When you want to buy things that aren’t in the grocery store you make deals with me on those. I tell you the prices. You can get me on CB channel 9 and then we’ll switch over to channel 34,” he picked that number because that’s how old he was, “and I take your order, tell you if we have it, and we agree on a price. You come here to this gas station and we do the deal like we are now.”</p>
   <p>“Besides guns and ammo,” Rich said, “what else works to buy things?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Gold and silver,” Bennington said. “Some people still take cash, but the amounts are so high it’s kind of impractical. Things like tools and machinery are valuable. You can let me know what you guys have to sell and we can get you FCards or whatever for them.”</p>
   <p>“What about gas?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“To buy or to sell?” Bennington asked.</p>
   <p>“To buy,” Rich said.</p>
   <p>“We have the only operating gas stations around here. You can buy gas with FCards or other things. But,” Bennington said very seriously, “we control the gas, alright? You don’t buy from anyone else.”</p>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said. Message received.</p>
   <p>“So what else works for payment of things we need,” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“.22 ammo, especially for small things,” Bennington said. “A box of fifty rounds is like change: fifty little pieces almost like pennies.” That made sense. Rich noticed that .22 rifles and pistols were coming out of the woodwork. Everyone seemed to have one that had been in an attic somewhere.</p>
   <p>“Of course, booze and cigarettes,” Bennington continued. “We sell those, but you can also use them to buy other things.”</p>
   <p>Bennington paused. He was embarrassed about the next part. “Drugs and young ladies. That works, too. Buy or sell.” Rich knew how hard the “young ladies” thing was on Bennington, who had always been a decent guy.</p>
   <p>This was no time for loose ends, so Rich thought he’d clarify one more point. So he looked at Bennington in the eye and said, “Along with safe passage comes being left alone. I mean, Pierce Point won’t be causing Commissioner Winters any trouble. We don’t give a shit about politics. Patriot, Loyalist, whatever. We don’t care. We just want to get through this.” While it was true that they wanted to get through this; the part about not caring about Patriots was basically a lie, but Rich needed Bennington to report back that Pierce Point didn’t care about politics.</p>
   <p>“And,” Rich said, “We don’t need anything from the government, really. So we’re not a drain on your resources. We’ll be our own little kingdom and come into town to trade. We want to be left alone. We have some assets that make any unwelcome visit a suicide mission. Understand?”</p>
   <p>“Understood,” Bennington said. “I understood perfectly the other day when I saw that gate and all your guys. And those dogs. And now Marines and contractors. Oh, I’ll put out the word that you don’t fuck with Pierce Point,” Bennington said with a smile. The first one he’d cracked all morning.</p>
   <p>That got Bennington thinking. Maybe Pierce Point would be a good ally in what he was considering doing.</p>

   </title>
   <p>Pow and Ryan heard Bennington’s trunk door close and knew it was time to go. They did a final scan of the area and looked at Rich for a signal. Rich waved for them to get back in the truck. They did.</p>
   <p>Cindy was glad this part of the trip had gone off without a hitch. Rich got back in his truck and said, “Time to go get some medical supplies.”</p>
   <p>Rich followed Bennington’s police car. Pow and Ryan didn’t say anything in the back. They were busy scanning for threats. This was not the time for chatting. For all they knew, Bennington was stealing the ARs and driving them into an ambush to dispose of the witnesses.</p>
   <p>There were almost no other cars on the road; they only saw one that morning. It was weird driving this formerly busy road now that they were basically the only ones on it.</p>
   <p>It was dangerous to be on the roads. The police—what were left of them—and deputized civilians patrolled near the outskirts of town. Outside of town, which would include the route from Pierce Point to Frederickson, there were rumors of private roadblocks run by various local gangs. They would take whatever someone had. Except for government vehicles, which tended to be well guarded. Tammy, who still went to work every day toward town to her job at the electric company, had never reported any problems. The private roadblocks may have just been rumors or exaggerations of occasional incidents.</p>
   <p>Rumors were running rampant during the Collapse. It seemed like people with time on their hands, because they didn’t have normal jobs to go to, just sat around and said to each other, “Well, I heard…” People loved to outdo each other by telling an even greater tale of how bad things were. Rich had learned that things were rarely as bad as the rumors said they were.</p>
   <p>They started coming to the city limit and slowed down. Bennington pulled his car into the roadblock area which was manned by one other police car and about ten armed volunteers with blue ribbons tied around their left arms—the “Blue Ribbon Boys,” as they were known. They looked like decent guards, mostly young guys in hunting clothes. A lot like the Pierce Point guards, although Pierce Point had a greater variety of ages and some women. Three FC with the stupid hard hats were with the Blue Ribbon Boys at the city-limits roadblock. They had an RV there, which seemed to be the headquarters.</p>
   <p>The guards were particularly interested in the two extremely well-armed men in the back of Rich’s truck. They were signaling to hidden people apparently on the sides of road out from the roadblock. They must have snipers in the tree line. Pow and Ryan had the distinct feeling they were being viewed through rifle scopes.</p>
   <p>Ryan said to Pow, “Follow my lead. I’ve been through lots of checkpoints before.” Ryan put his right hand out to his side to show anyone looking through a rifle scope that he was not going to fire. With his left hand, he slowly cinched his AR sling so his carbine was tight against his chest and wouldn’t move around. This allowed him to have his hands free. Then he moved his left hand out to his side so now both hands were out as if to signal, “Yeah, we know your snipers have us scoped and we’re not going to do anything stupid.” But he could instantly pull on a separate flap on his SKT sling—the kind the Team all used—and his AR would be loosened and ready to bring up and fire. When Ryan was done and had his hands out, he said to Pow, “Now you do the same. Slowly.” Pow did.</p>
   <p>Bennington got out and motioned for Rich and his passengers to stay in their truck. Bennington talked to his fellow cop at the roadblock. The FC came over and Bennington started to explain something to them. Then he came over to Rich’s side of the truck and said, “You need to get out and get your ID. The rest of you should stay in the truck.” Bennington looked at Pow and Ryan as if to say, “You jump out of this truck and you’ll be dead.”</p>
   <p>Bennington walked to the back of the truck and told Pow and Ryan to stay put. They nodded. Their hands were still at their sides. They looked professional, like they’d been through roadblocks before.</p>
   <p>Pow, who did not suffer from a lack of self-esteem when it came to his tactical abilities, was glad to have a combat Marine like Ryan on the Team. He realized he had plenty to learn from Ryan and others. Pow had never mistaken himself for a professional, he just played the part very well, which was important out there. Appearing to be a trained fighter could save his life and the lives of others.</p>
   <p>Pow loved every minute of this. Even though he was literally in the crosshairs of a sniper, he thoroughly enjoyed sitting in the back of the truck with Ryan, armed to the teeth and out there helping people like Cindy and the people who needed the medical supplies. It took a different kind of person to enjoy this. And Pow, Ryan, and the rest of the Team were that kind of person. They were great people to have on your side.</p>
   <p>The Blue Ribbon Boys and the FC did not appear to be loving this. It was another morning of work for them. They’d been standing there, bored out of their minds, for hours. They were just doing this for the FCards and their cut of the loot that came through.</p>
   <p>It wasn’t clear what motivated the FC to be doing this. Maybe they genuinely wanted to save the town from Patriot “terrorists.” Whatever good Samaritan impulses they had were gone by now; about two weeks into the Collapse, the FC with the Blue Ribbon Boys were just doing it for the loot. It was amazing how quickly old ideals like “community service” disappeared from many people. This was a business now.</p>
   <p>As he was getting out of the truck to get his ID, Rich was taking in all he could about the roadblock. The number of men, the number and apparent organization of the FC, and the communications equipment they had. Rich had no intention of attacking the roadblock later, but he had gotten into the habit of evaluating every group of armed people and seeing if he could think of a weakness in their defenses. He was doing it now without even thinking.</p>
   <p>Rich noticed the boredom and lack of enthusiasm of the guards. They wouldn’t fight to the death. They would fire a few rounds and look for an escape route. Rich contrasted the Blue Ribbon Boys with the Pierce Point guards. Most of the Pierce Point guards would fight to the death. They were defending their homes and neighbors, not running a racket like these guys. It was an entirely different set of motivations. Rich expected some of the Pierce Point guards to fold under fire, but there would be enough hanging in the fight to motivate the ones who wanted to run away. Probably. Rich hoped he’d never have to find out.</p>
   <p>Rich went to the person Bennington pointed to; an FC guy with a clipboard who looked like he had previously worked his whole life in some government office. The FC guy handed the clipboard to Rich and said, “Fill this out.” It was an application. What a joke. No one would ever “process” this. What were they going to do? Deny his application? Rich had paid good money—well, actually, an AR—for safe passage into town. It was absurd to think the FC had any real control over his safe passage. Winters did. Everyone knew that.</p>
   <p>The application was just another bureaucratic paperwork thing. The FC guy could tell his boss back at some headquarters in Olympia or wherever that they issued a certain number of passes when, in reality, the only thing that mattered was that Commissioner Winters and his people said certain people got the IDs. The application seemed like a prop to maintain the mirage that there was a functioning and impartial government. That was a better impression to leave the population with than the truth: government-run gangs were in charge.</p>
   <p>Rich filled out the form. Under “occupation,” he put “security contractor.” He chuckled to himself. He had never actually thought of himself as one, but now, having to name his occupation, he thought that the term fit. The application had a part that said the applicant swore allegiance to the United States and agreed to accept the emergency powers temporarily being used to restore order. It had a box for their initials. Another total joke. What? Like initialing a box meant that they actually pledged their life to some non-existent thing like a functioning United States? The application was supposed to instill confidence that there was a real government agency working hard for the people. It produced the exact opposite effect on Rich. He initialed the box and sighed.</p>
   <p>He handed the clipboard back to the FC guy, who checked it over and sent Rich over to a Blue Ribbon Boy. That guy handed Rich a foot-long and two-inch wide cloth strip in a distinctive purple and gold pattern that, indeed, would be impossible to duplicate. They must have had some big piece of this cloth and used it to make these IDs. Pretty clever, really. “Put it on your left arm,” the Blue Ribbon Boy said, pointing to his own cloth strip tied around his arm. Rich did so. Now Rich had an official pass to go to town. Funny. He didn’t need to pay a bribe or have special permission to go to town in the past. This was life in Collapse America.</p>
   <p>Rich just stood there. He didn’t want to make any sudden moves. Finally, he asked the Blue Ribbon Boy who handed him the ID, “Can I go back to my truck now?” The boy nodded. Rich went back to this truck.</p>
   <p>He got in and Cindy asked, “How will it work for me getting the supplies?”</p>
   <p>“Dunno,” Rich said. “Bennington will tell us.”</p>
   <p>A minute or two later, Bennington came up to Rich’s side of the truck. “I’ll ride with you,” he said motioning for Rich to let him in the cab. Rich motioned for Cindy to get into the extended cab behind them. “Sorry,” Rich mouthed to Cindy. She understood. The guy with the directions needed to be up front.</p>
   <p>When Bennington got into the cab, he said to Rich, “Keep your left arm with the ID out the window.” Rich nodded.</p>
   <p>As Rich pulled away, Ryan in the back of the truck nodded to the Blue Ribbon Boys and FC and said, “Have a nice day, gentlemen.” They nodded back. This was just business.</p>
   <p>Rich wondered why Bennington didn’t just have them follow him in his patrol car. Maybe to save gas?</p>
   <p>Once Bennington was in the cab, Rich realized why. He was telling Rich a lot about the conditions in town. Bennington wanted to brief Rich in person, which meant in Rich’s truck. That seemed a little odd. Why didn’t Bennington care what Rich knew about the conditions in town? Rich got the feeling that Bennington was trying to get him on his side. For something. Rich didn’t know what, but Bennington was definitely trying to get Rich on his side.</p>
   <p>They came up to another check point. It only had two guys; two Mexicans. “That’s the Mexican sector or ‘Mexi Zone’ as we call it,” Bennington said. “Basically, they are keeping other people out and running things in there themselves. Apparently there was some white guy who pulled an AK on them in one of their grocery stores a few days ago. They’re taking care of themselves,” Bennington said.</p>
   <p>“The Mexicans are run by the Senorita,” Bennington said. “She’s a grandmother. Tough as nails. Kind of a godfather kind of lady. She came to power during the refugee crisis in California and Texas. The Mexicans rallied together to take care of themselves. Some gang members from Mexico came up here. She is related to one of them, an offshoot of the CDE or Cartel del Gulfo or Gulf Cartel. But, from what we can tell, the Senorita doesn’t run the place like the cartels back in Mexico. No beheadings or anything like that.”</p>
   <p>Bennington continued, “The Senorita runs the place like the Italian mob: not terribly violent and they don’t go after women and children. They will take care of business, but they don’t exactly terrorize their own. And they are good business partners.”</p>
   <p>“With who?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Us,” Bennington said, looking down because he was ashamed. “Commissioner Winters and us, the FC, the government,” Bennington said, like Rich was stupid not to know that.</p>
   <p>“Oh,” Rich said. Always the curious cop, Rich asked, “What kind of business do you do with them?”</p>
   <p>Bennington was embarrassed, but he wanted to tell Rich what was going on. So he said, “Oh, the Mexicans run the gas sales. We sell them the bulk fuel that we get from FEMA and others. They get to keep the profits. We let them run the drugs and girls. They have a lot of their own girls they use for that.” Bennington could see in his mind’s eye the faces of the teenage Mexican girls working the streets and it almost made him cry. He hated that. Hated it. He wished he could figure out a way to make it stop.</p>
   <p>“So all you get out of this is sales of bulk fuel?” Rich asked. That didn’t seem very lucrative for all the trouble Commissioner Winters was going to. There must be more.</p>
   <p>“We get a couple things out of it,” Bennington said. “First of all, we get peace. We have zero problems with the Mexicans. That’s a big deal. We don’t have the resources to be fighting more people. It’s hard enough to keep the anglos,” a term meaning non-Hispanics, “in line. The fewer people we have to police, the better. Commissioner Winters also gets customers from the Mexicans.”</p>
   <p>“Customers? For what?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“The stores,” Bennington said. “We get a cut from the food and other sales on the FCards. And we make reports to Olympia on the number of people we’re feeding. Headquarters likes to see that we’re feeding lots of people and have relatively less violence than elsewhere. We’re kind of a model.”</p>
   <p>A model? Rich thought. An ethnic ghetto, sex slavery, God-awful corruption? That’s the model? Apparently so.</p>
   <p>“There are some nice political benefits, too, for Commissioner Winters,” Bennington said. “The Senorita goes on radio and the internet and talks about how the government is taking care of everyone of every skin color.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah,” Rich said, “if ‘taking care of’ means letting them run a sector and running rackets. Is that really ‘taking care of’ people?” He realized he shouldn’t have said that.</p>
   <p>Bennington snapped back, “It’s complicated, OK? It’s complicated.” He was quiet for a while.</p>
   <p>Rich broke the silence by saying, “Sorry, man. I realize you’re playing the hand you’ve been dealt.”</p>
   <p>Hearing that was a relief to Bennington. “Thanks, man,” Bennington said. “Playing the hand I’ve been dealt. That’s right. I hate the way things are.” Bennington stared out the window. He was looking at closed down businesses. People were walking around aimlessly, and looked scared. Scared to be on the streets. Vandalized cars. Broken windows in stores from smash-and-grabs. A burned out restaurant. It looked like L.A. after riots. And this was the “model.”</p>
   <p>As they drove toward the hospital, Rich noticed some graffiti. It was everywhere. It was painted in yellow and said, “I miss America,” and “Resist.” Rich figured it was Patriot graffiti, but thought he’d ask Bennington.</p>
   <p>“What’s that?” Rich asked, pointing to the graffiti.</p>
   <p>“Some Patriot bullshit,” Bennington said. “I do miss America,” he said. Then he caught himself, “But those Patriots are just a bunch of terrorists, you know?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, yeah, that’s what I heard,” Rich said. He was starting to get the feeling that Bennington was a closet Patriot. Maybe that’s why Bennington wanted to brief Rich on the conditions in town.</p>
   <p>Nah, Rich thought. That was just wishful thinking. But Rich couldn’t shake the feeling that Bennington was an ally trying to reach out as much as he could. Rich would tuck that away in his mind and see if future information supported or contradicted that theory.</p>
   <p>More silence. Finally Rich asked, “So what’s the deal with the FC? How do they fit in?”</p>
   <p>Bennington said, “Oh, they’re a joke. Really. They can’t do a thing without back up. And by ‘back up’ I mean the National Guard. Those FC ass munchers are basically here to keep an eye on Commissioner Winters and make sure he’s doing what FEMA and Olympia want. That we’re not stealing too much,” Bennington said, darting his eyes down to the floor of the cab. He was embarrassed by that.</p>
   <p>“We could have them…offed in ten seconds,” Bennington said, “But then the Guard would come here. So we put up with their stupid FC forms and occasional directions. Of course, we let them run their own rackets. Little ones. We let them sell stuff on the side. One of them has a real problem with the ladies. We,” Bennington looked down at the cab floor again, “look the other way when he does bad things.”</p>
   <p>Rich felt sorry for Bennington. Rich had more in common with him than he had thought when they started the bribery that morning in the gas station parking lot. Back then, just an hour or so ago, Rich felt like Bennington was the complete opposite of him. But now he realized Bennington wasn’t. It was complicated, Rich now realized.</p>
   <p>“Can’t you do anything about it?” Rich asked. “Or would that get the National Guard or whatever involved?”</p>
   <p>Bennington just nodded. He realized that Cindy was in the extended cab and could hear all of this. He didn’t mind confiding in a fellow cop, or ex-cop, like Rich. But there were limits; he shouldn’t be saying these things to a civilian like Cindy. Bennington needed to change the subject.</p>
   <p>“The hospital is coming up,” Bennington said, even though Rich knew exactly how to drive to it. Rich had been there hundreds of times when he was a cop. Cindy got out her clipboard.</p>
   <p>“Things like these medical supplies,” Bennington said. “That’s another kind of thing Commissioner Winters runs. Any miscellaneous thing people need like this. It comes through us. We control these things and we make the money.” He seemed less embarrassed about it now. It was like he got some things off his chest earlier in the ride.</p>
   <p>Cindy hadn’t been to her old job for almost three weeks. That was when medical personnel quit coming to work because it was too dangerous. The hospital never told people to stay home, but all it took was one key person to be gone, like a key medical device technician, and all the work several others did was on hold. There was no use coming to work, so most people just stopped coming. On Cindy’s last day, she was one of the only people there.</p>
   <p>She had renal patients on dialysis. They would…die without the treatments. She couldn’t think about it. She got to know them from their regular sessions. Mrs. Fitch, Simon Butler, little Tony. What a brave little boy Tony…was. Past tense. Was.</p>
   <p>Cindy felt so guilty about not being there with them when they died. Part of her job, and her calling as a nurse, was to comfort and encourage people. But she abandoned them. Left them to die, even though she knew she couldn’t go in to work. The last day she was at work she convinced herself of that. As she left work that last day, she watched helplessly as the car ahead of her at the stop light got car jacked. God only knew what happened to the young woman driving and her baby.</p>
   <p>Back in the rear cab of Rich’s truck, Cindy shuddered as they drove through that same intersection. What had happened to that woman and her baby? Cindy prayed—she literally folded her hands and prayed—that losing the car was all that happened to them. Oh God. What had happened to America?</p>
   <p>“You got your list?” Bennington asked as he turned his head back toward Cindy.</p>
   <p>“Yes,” she said. It was the first time Cindy had said anything in quite a while. She thought Rich and Bennington didn’t know she was back there the whole time listening to how horrible things were.</p>
   <p>There were some guards at the entrance to the hospital. The parking lot was empty, except for a few vandalized and burned out cars. The lights were off for several floors of the hospital. Looking at the outside of the hospital, it seemed like it wasn’t open.</p>
   <p>That was an odd thought: the hospital might not be open. Hospitals were always open. Twenty-four hours a day; they never “closed.” But it looked like Frederickson General Hospital might actually be closed. It was hard for Cindy to come to grips with this sight.</p>
   <p>Bennington told Rich, “Slow down. Then stop here,” Bennington pointed to a barrel about twenty-five yards from the guards, “and keep your arm band out the window.” When the truck stopped, Bennington waved at the guards and yelled, “They’re with me. Official business.”</p>
   <p>The guards nodded. Bennington got out and pointed toward the back of the truck at Pow and Ryan. “They’re with me, too.”</p>
   <p>The guards nodded again.</p>
   <p>Bennington went to the back of the truck and said to Pow and Ryan, “You guys can stay out here. No need to come in. I’ve got it covered.”</p>
   <p>Pow and Ryan didn’t believe Bennington. Their instructions were to protect Cindy, her medical supplies, and Rich and that’s what they were going to do. They looked at Rich through the window of the extended cab. Rich mouthed, “It’s cool.”</p>
   <p>“OK,” Ryan said. Besides, Rich was armed. He only carried a pistol, but could take care of things. Ryan and Pow knew that there was a system when picking up black market products: The cops and, sometimes the customers, are the only armed ones. The customers’ armed escorts—especially extremely heavily armed escorts like them—needed to stay outside. It was like a drug deal, except that it was the government selling people medical supplies. Kind of the same thing, really.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 135</p>
    <p><emphasis>Private-Pay Medical Care</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Bennington went to the front of the truck and opened Cindy’s extended cab door and helped her out. Manners were still alive and well in Collapse America.</p>
   <p>Bennington went over to Rich’s door and motioned for him to get out. Pow and Ryan felt vulnerable in that parking lot. They could be hit by snipers from several directions. They did not feel comfortable just sitting there, but they didn’t want to make any moves and get shot by the guards. They nervously scanned the parking lot and the guards for threats. Things were quiet. There were virtually no cars. It was warm with a slight breeze. It was peaceful, in a weird way. It was like the pace of life had slowed down to a trickle. But, it wasn’t relaxing. They expected to be shot at any minute.</p>
   <p>Bennington led Rich and Cindy toward the guards. Bennington pointed to Rich’s arm band and the guards nodded. People nodded a lot during the Collapse. It was like they didn’t have things to say, just to verify that they understood things like “this guy will be coming toward you, so don’t shoot him.”</p>
   <p>Cindy was getting physically ill as she looked at what used to be the beautiful hospital. Trash was everywhere. It looked like people had been camped out in the parking lot and just left their garbage. She saw some baby diapers on the ground. That really hurt her. People must have been camping out with their kids waiting for care. Did they get care? Were they turned away? Did they get killed?</p>
   <p>Oh God. Cindy kept saying that. Oh God. She put her hand up to her mouth because she thought she might throw up.</p>
   <p>The next shock to Cindy was the entrance. Some bullet holes crumbled the cement walls. It looked like a scene from the Middle East. There were only about five bullet holes, but it was still something she never thought she’d see at a hospital. Or anywhere else. There were shell casings on the ground. Not too many. It didn’t look like there was a big gun fight there, just some shots.</p>
   <p>Then she saw it. A huge red stain on the pavement at the entrance to the hospital. It must have been gallons of blood. Someone had tried to clean it up as well as they could. There were splotches in different places. It looked like there had been lots of people, bleeding in lots of different places. The red stains were various colors. Some of it must have been from weeks ago and other stains from days ago. It reminded Cindy of the slaughterhouse she visited as a kid. Only this was human slaughtering.</p>
   <p>Then the smell hit her. It smelled like that distinctive hospital smell, but with the added overpowering smells of strong cleaning agents, vomit, body odor, and…death. It smelled like death.</p>
   <p>Cindy didn’t want to keep walking. She wanted to run back to the truck and go home. She actually stopped walking and thought about going back to the truck. Then she got a hold of herself and kept walking.</p>
   <p>She was a nurse; a professional who helped people. She had a job to do; a very important job, and she would do it. She would not let people down. There were other little Tonys out there who needed help. She couldn’t help him now, but she could help others. She started to cry. Rich and Bennington tried to ignore it, although it was hard. A crying woman is always something hard to ignore.</p>
   <p>They walked through the dimly lit entrance. The lights were on, just not many of them. Cindy listened for the hum of the generators that went on during the drills before the Collapse. She didn’t hear them. They weren’t on generator power, but still only had partial lighting. Cindy wondered why.</p>
   <p>Then she saw the reception area and knew why. It was empty. They didn’t have many lights on because there were almost no staff or patients there. With all the need for medical care out there, Cindy could not understand why the place wasn’t crowded.</p>
   <p>“Where are all the patients?” she asked Bennington.</p>
   <p>He shrugged. “There was a big rush here after about May Day,” he said. “Way too many people. It overwhelmed the hospital, so they had to put up security.” Bennington looked down at the ground again, a sure sign that he was ashamed of something. He paused, “It got a little violent, but all the people were scattered. Just not enough doctors or supplies for them.”</p>
   <p>Rich, who was curious by nature, asked, “If there weren’t enough supplies, why are we getting some today?” Once again, Rich regretted asking such a question.</p>
   <p>Bennington got red in the face. He tried to get his composure. He realized that getting mad wouldn’t change anything. But he was so tired. He hadn’t a good night’s sleep since May Day, and he felt himself starting to get pissed.</p>
   <p>“Why are you getting some today?” Bennington angrily asked. “Because you paid for them, dumbass.” Bennington just stared at Rich. “Don’t ask stupid questions any more. Seriously, Rich. Shut the fuck up. OK?”</p>
   <p>Bennington realized he was yelling at a potential ally, so he tried to smooth it over with Rich. He used a calm tone and said, “Sorry. After the rush here, and when everyone got turned away, word went out that the hospital was closed. It pretty much was. They were out of supplies. A truckload came in about a week ago. It was a small truckload. We didn’t tell people it was here because we’d just have to beat them back again,” Bennington said, once again looking down toward the ground. “There’s maybe five doctors and a dozen nurses on duty now. We let emergency personnel come in here. That’s it. Oh,” he added, and once again he looked at the ground, “and private-pay customers.”</p>
   <p>So this was government-run health care, Rich thought. A smashing success. It sucked before the Collapse, but now was non-functioning. Except for government people and “private-pay” customers. “Private-pay,” as in people who brought in AR-15s and a case of ammo.</p>
   <p>As they continued to walk down the hall toward the back of the hospital, they saw a few people. Some visitors of patients. One woman and a little girl had flowers. As they walked past them, Cindy heard the woman say to the girl, “Daddy is going to get better.” Maybe he was a cop or politician or something.</p>
   <p>As they turned down the next hall toward the medical supply storage area and pharmacy, there were four guards. Two were Blue Ribbon Boys and the other two were FC. All of them had military rifles. Rich thought this must be where the good stuff is.</p>
   <p>The guards had a radio and apparently were told that Bennington and his guests would be coming. Rich prominently showed his armband and Bennington nodded. They stopped several yards in front of the guards.</p>
   <p>“Lt. Bennington, we’ve been expecting you,” one of the FC said. It sounded so weird to Rich to hear Sgt. Bennington being called “Lieutenant.”</p>
   <p>Bennington motioned for Cindy to hand the clipboard to the FC guard. She did. He looked it over and told the others to open the door.</p>
   <p>“Only she goes in,” the FC guard said.</p>
   <p>“OK,” Rich said. He looked at Cindy and she indicated that this was OK. She wondered if this was some kind of trap, but she realized that Rich had to stay if that’s what the guards said.</p>
   <p>One of the FC guards went into the room with Cindy. He handed her a shopping cart, which looked so odd there in the hospital. He just stood at the entrance watching her, which creeped her out. But she had a job to do and it was almost over.</p>
   <p>When Cindy was in the medical supply storage area, she couldn’t believe what she was seeing. She had never seen it so bare. There was almost nothing there. It was surreal. It was like seeing the always-full shelves at the grocery store empty for the first time. Cindy had seen those empty grocery store shelves a week ago, so this shouldn’t look too odd, but it did.</p>
   <p>The magnitude of this tragedy was unfolding in her mind. If this is all the medical supplies the biggest hospital in the county had…</p>
   <p>Cindy knew where most things were, so she assumed it would go quickly. She pushed the shopping cart down the aisles like she was shopping. They had about two thirds of what she needed. They had some things she didn’t have on her list. She started to put them in her cart, but paused. Was this OK? Would she get shot? She thought she better ask.</p>
   <p>Cindy went back to the entrance where the FC was standing and asked, “You don’t have some of these things, but do have some other things. Can I make substitutions?”</p>
   <p>“As long as you aren’t trying to get things from the pharmacy, then it’s fine,” he said. He didn’t give a crap about these medical supplies. It was the painkillers and anesthesia that was worth the big bucks.</p>
   <p>Cindy nodded and started making snap substitution decisions. She hoped she got it right. She didn’t want to be trying to save a patient’s life and think, “I could have got some of what I need back when I was getting supplies but didn’t think we’d need this.” Her mind was racing. She had to get it right.</p>
   <p>Finally, Cindy had what she needed, or at least her best guess of what was needed. She brought her cart up to the guard. He looked over the items, asked for her clipboard, and attempted to compare the items to the clipboard. He really didn’t have any idea what he was doing, he was just told that he needed to do it. He said, “OK, now to the pharmacy.”</p>
   <p>Cindy followed him. They went out the door to the door across the hall. The FC guard had a separate key for the pharmacy.</p>
   <p>They went in and, once again, Cindy was struck by how abandoned the place seemed. Most of the pharmacy was empty. There was a big bloodstain near the door in the reception area. It looked like someone had come to the reception desk, gotten shot, and ran out the door. Probably a drug seeker. It must have been horrible to be a pharmacist during all this.</p>
   <p>The FC guard took her clipboard again. Politely, but firmly. He looked it over. “I will get these for you,” he said. There was no way they would let someone from the outside just walk through the pharmacy with all those valuable drugs; tiny pills could easily be slipped into pockets.</p>
   <p>He came back with very few pill bottles. “We’re a little low on painkillers, but we have extra liquid anesthesia for you.” Apparently there was less of a street market for liquid anesthesia.</p>
   <p>“That’s fine,” Cindy said. “We need the liquid more, anyway.”</p>
   <p>The guard went back and returned with various vials and bottles. He showed her what he had and they checked things off the list. Apparently, this guard had some pharmacy knowledge.</p>
   <p>He put it all in the shopping cart, which was full by now, and said, “I think you’re done.”</p>
   <p>“OK,” Cindy said, realizing that she had no power to say otherwise.</p>
   <p>Cindy and the guard left. As he was locking the door to the pharmacy, she looked back. The place looked so empty and abandoned. So dead, and so cold.</p>
   <p>They walked out. Rich, Bennington, and the other guards were there.</p>
   <p>“That was quick,” Bennington said. He was glad this was going smoothly. He had other business to do for Commissioner Winters before lunch.</p>
   <p>Rich asked, “Did you get everything you need?” Rich realized that while he didn’t have a lot of leverage here, a deal was a deal. Bennington had promised the items on the clipboard and Rich wasn’t going to leave without them, unless they pulled a gun on him. Then he’d have to.</p>
   <p>“Pretty much,” Cindy said. “They didn’t have some things, but let me substitute for others. It’ll be fine.” She hoped that she had thought of everything they’d need on her one and only shopping trip to the hospital for supplies.</p>
   <p>Rich, ever the gentlemen, offered to push the cart for Cindy. They walked back through the halls and saw a few nurses and one doctor. They saw two patients. It was about 5% of the activity Cindy was used to at the hospital. It seemed so empty. But, it was even weirder that there was a little activity than if the hospital had been entirely closed. Cindy had never conceived of a hospital operating at 5% capacity. She couldn’t fit what she was seeing into any mental template.</p>
   <p>They walked outside and there were Pow and Ryan sitting in the back of the truck. Bennington motioned to the parking lot guards that everything was OK.</p>
   <p>As Rich and Cindy got to the truck, Pow asked, “Everything go OK?”</p>
   <p>Cindy started bawling. Pow and Ryan were startled. They wondered what had happened.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, we got what we need,” Rich said. Bennington was silent. He was tired of having days like this. Tired of women crying. Tired of all this. Tired of Winters and all this corruption.</p>
   <p>Everyone was quiet on the drive back. The shock of seeing all the destruction in Frederickson had worn off. Cindy had stopped crying by now. She was trying her best to stop so she didn’t alarm the others.</p>
   <p>“Hey, I need some gas,” Rich said to Bennington. He had a full tank, but brought a few five-gallon gas cans. “Where is the best place to get some?” By “best place” Rich meant the approved gang gas station.</p>
   <p>Bennington pointed toward the Mexican sector. He wasn’t in a talkative mood. Once they got close to the Mexican gas station, Bennington asked, “What you got to pay for this?”</p>
   <p>Rich said, “I have some cash.” Drew had volunteered more of his stash, which Rich greatly appreciated.</p>
   <p>“How much?” Bennington asked.</p>
   <p>“How much a gallon?” Rich responded.</p>
   <p>“For cash? Probably $100 a gallon. I’ll go see.” Bennington got out of the truck and talked to the Mexican man running the station. Bennington came back.</p>
   <p>“Yep. $100 a gallon,” Bennington said.</p>
   <p>Rich got out Drew’s envelope of cash. He pulled out $1,000. He counted it out to Bennington.</p>
   <p>“Ten gallons for this gentlemen,” Bennington said to the Mexican man.</p>
   <p>Rich started to get out of the truck to get the gas cans and pump the gas. Bennington stopped him and said, “Nope. No self-service. We’d hate for people to ‘accidently’ put in more gas than they paid for. Not worth dying just because you put in an extra gallon, know what I mean?”</p>
   <p>It wasn’t like Bennington to talk like that, Rich thought. It didn’t seem natural for a decent guy like Bennington to say such a thing.</p>
   <p>The Mexican man put in ten gallons. Both gas cans were full. Bennington smiled at Rich. That was the Bennington he knew. Not the “you’ll die if you put in an extra gallon” side of Bennington that Rich just witnessed.</p>
   <p>Rich liked Bennington and also knew that he needed to get along with him for the sake of the people at Pierce Point, so he decided to keep talking to him, even though Bennington didn’t seem very chatty today.</p>
   <p>“We’ll be back soon with the FCard forms and start shopping in town,” Rich said to Bennington.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” Bennington said. “We’ll take you back to the city limits and get you the forms.”</p>
   <p>The trip back to the city limits was uneventful. When they got back to the city-limits roadblock, Bennington returned to his car. He checked the trunk. The ARs, magazines, and case of ammunition were still in the back. Bennington was never concerned that his truck would get robbed while he went into town with Rich. All the Blue Ribbon Boys and even the FC knew that stealing from Bennington—and ultimately from Commissioner Winters—would be a very bad idea.</p>
   <p>One of the FC handed Rich a stack of FCard forms to take back and fill out.</p>
   <p>“How many are there?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>The FC shrugged. “Dunno,” he said. “Enough. Fill these out, and if you need more, come back.” The government had no idea whatsoever who had FCards and didn’t really care.</p>
   <p>After all the horror of the trip into town, Rich was exhausted and didn’t feel like talking, but he thought he needed to say something to Bennington as they departed.</p>
   <p>“Hey, man, thanks for everything,” he said.</p>
   <p>Bennington nodded. He didn’t say anything. He was deep in thought about the biggest decision of his life. One that very likely would cost him his life. Bennington had decided to go through with his plan. And hopefully Rich would be part of it.</p>

    <p>Chapter 136</p>
    <p><emphasis>It’s Not Just Guns and Gardening</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>Rich was still exhausted, mentally and emotionally, from the trip into town. So was Cindy; she just looked out the window. She had stopped crying and she just felt cold and dark.</p>
   <p>On the way back, Rich kept thinking about the graffiti that said, “I miss America.” He couldn’t stop thinking about how that summed up everything. Everything.</p>
   <p>Ryan was also deep in thought. After a while, he couldn’t take the silence and had to say something. “Did you catch all that?” he asked Pow in the back of the truck.</p>
   <p>“All of what?” Pow asked.</p>
   <p>“The guards, the layout, the locations. All of that,” Ryan said.</p>
   <p>Pow was relieved that Ryan had been thinking the same thing he had. Pow didn’t want to admit that he had been thinking for some time now that surviving in Pierce Point was great, but they should be ready to hit back at anyone hitting them. Pow had gone from thinking purely defensively to offensively. The two were related in this situation.</p>
   <p>“Roger that, brother,” Pow said. “Roger that.”</p>
   <p>Ryan smiled. These UCG—“untrained civilian goofballs” as the Team called themselves—were pretty good at this, despite a lack of formal training.</p>
   <p>Ryan fished out two small notepads and pens from his kit. He handed one to Pow.</p>
   <p>“Here,” Ryan said. “Write things down now, while they’re fresh. Draw maps. Put it all down.” It was a little too bumpy in the back of the truck to write, but Pow started jotting down the important points he’d follow up on later, when the truck stopped.</p>
   <p>“Thanks,” Pow said. This was a lot more than shooting on the range with his buddies. This was sketching out maps of enemy facilities. This was getting bigger.</p>
   <p>When they were a half mile from the Pierce Point gate, Heidi Copeland, the “comm chick,” heard a crackle on the CB set to channel 11.</p>
   <p>It was followed by a whispered voice on her CB. “Company. Rich truck. No one following,” said the voice. It was Sniper Mike somewhere out there in the woods.</p>
   <p>Heidi replied, “Copy,” meaning she understood the message. She didn’t talk much to Sniper Mike, just acknowledged receipt of his messages. Mike had his volume turned down all the way, but still there was no need to send out lots of sound from Mike’s radio. She would hate for him to get caught because of her.</p>
   <p>Heidi radioed Dan on the daily use channel, which was 27 that day. They rotated it each day. “Fred One return,” she said into the CB.</p>
   <p>“Roger,” said Dan. “Fred One” was Rich’s radio call sign. They just made up “Fred One” for Rich. Dan consciously didn’t want to get “too military” with call signs like “Eagle One” or “Alpha One.” It seemed overly dramatic for what they were doing out there, which was just surviving. Dan knew that the guards and Team would be taken a lot more seriously by the residents if they kept it simple and low-key instead of “playing Army.”</p>
   <p>That being said, there was plenty of military structure out for the guards, the Team, and beach patrol. There had to be. They had to maintain discipline and be effective. But it would be easy to overdo it if they weren’t careful. Remember, Dan kept telling himself and the others, we’re just here to get through this. We are not a military unit and we’re not trying to be. Guarding your neighborhood is just temporary until things return to normal. “Winning” at this means there is no longer a need for guards. Or radio code names.</p>
   <p>Rich came up to the gate. He waved and a guard ran up to open the gate. Rich pulled into the volunteer fire station.</p>
   <p>He looked at his watch. It was 12:15 p.m. He was hungry and Mrs. Roth’s funeral was at 2:00 pm, but it was time to get some work done. He had to brief Dan and Grant on what had just happened. He asked Heidi to get Dan, Grant and the rest of the Team there.</p>
   <p>Cindy was still sitting in the cab of the truck. She didn’t want to get out. She was frozen.</p>
   <p>“You OK?” Rich asked her.</p>
   <p>“Oh. Huh? Oh, yeah,” she said. She had been zoning out so hard that she was nearly in a trance. She had been thinking so hard about all that had happened and the nearly empty hospital. The diapers in the parking lot. Little Tony. She needed to snap out of it and get to work.</p>
   <p>“We’ll get you and the new supplies up to the Grange,” Rich said to Cindy. She nodded.</p>
   <p>Rich realized that Cindy knew some things that shouldn’t spread around Pierce Point. Like the fake fifty Marines and dozen contractors, and the awful conditions in town.</p>
   <p>“Cindy,” Rich said to her in the privacy of the truck cab, “you saw and heard a lot of things in town that can’t get spread around. Please don’t talk about them.”</p>
   <p>Cindy nodded. She seemed to have snapped out of her trance and was listening.</p>
   <p>Rich went over all the things Cindy shouldn’t talk about. The bribe, the five squads of Marines, the corruption, and the lack of a real hospital. “We don’t want people in here to lose hope. Highlight the positive. We’re going to fill out FCards, that kind of thing. They…”</p>
   <p>“I know,” Cindy said. “I know. They need hope. I know.” Rich could tell that she needed hope herself. And that was much harder now that she’d seen what was going on in town. She got out of the truck.</p>
   <p>Rich noticed that Pow and Ryan were still sitting in the truck.</p>
   <p>“You guys gonna get out?” Rich asked, puzzled at why they hadn’t jumped right out.</p>
   <p>“Making some notes and maps,” Ryan said.</p>
   <p>Rich grinned. Wow. He was so lucky to have all these amazing people here. What a treasure trove of human beings.</p>
   <p>Rich thought about all the work he needed to do. It would be a few minutes before Grant and the Team got there. He was hungry. He headed over to the volunteer fire station to see if there was some food. Everyone was asking him how things were in town. “Fine,” he’d say. “We’re way better off in here, but there’s hope.” That’s all he’d say over and over again when he was asked the question.</p>
   <p>Some people asked him what the purple and gold armband was for. He told them that it was safe passage into town. That was good for them to know: there was such a thing as safe passage, but you needed a pass. And only Rich had it so don’t try going into town on your own.</p>
   <p>Rich ate some lunch. Beans and rice with some deer meat. One of the Mexican ladies in Pierce Point made lunch. It was fabulous. She was grinning from ear to ear; she loved to cook for people.</p>
   <p>They had been eating traditional foods like hamburgers up until now. Rich could tell that the “store bought” kinds of food, like hamburger buns and cheese must be running out. It was back to basic staples now. Hopefully those FCards would arrive just in time. For the first time, Rich was getting a little worried about the food situation.</p>
   <p>After a while, Dan, Grant and the rest of the Team showed up. Pow and Ryan joined them since they had first-hand accounts, and now notes and maps, to add to the debriefing. Rich took them out to his truck so the guards couldn’t hear. Rich told them about everything he learned on the trip into town. Getting FCard food from town quickly emerged as the most important item. They agreed to get working distributing the FCard applications. The next issue was who would go into town.</p>
   <p>“How do we control who goes in?” Grant asked.</p>
   <p>Rich pointed to his armband. “I got the only one.” That was a very effective way to control who went into town. They agreed that they’d round up any Marine fatigues they had out there—Ryan might have the only set—and get a few young “Marine looking” guys to be the ones to go into town. The “Marines” would have fake squad numbers and act like they were part of the “five squads.” They would be sworn to secrecy. The Team would go into town, too, in full kit. They would make up fake “contractor” personalities. Grant and Wes wouldn’t go into town because of the POI and AK things. They talked about gasoline and how to pay for it to go to town.</p>
   <p>They decided that runs into town would only be for FCard food. No vice runs. If people wanted booze or whatever, they had to risk it on their own.</p>
   <p>Actually, it was not OK for people to go do that. Pierce Point didn’t need people spending their gold, silver, ammo, eventual FCards, or cash on that stuff. They needed people to hold onto assets and spend them on food. They didn’t have the time or resources for that kind of stuff. They wouldn’t “outlaw” vice items at Pierce Point, but they would not give people rides to town to get them. The meeting out at Rich’s truck broke up. It was 1:30 p.m.</p>
   <p>People were getting in trucks to go to the Grange for Mrs. Roth’s funeral. They left enough guards, but most people went to the Grange.</p>
   <p>There were more people at the funeral service than at a typical meeting at the Grange. There were new faces there. Many people were more drawn to a funeral than to the “politics” of running the place.</p>
   <p>Fair enough. Not everyone had to be interested in what happened at the Grange meetings. “Politics” had acquired such a well-deserved dirty name with all that happened, so people couldn’t be blamed for shying away from it. At least the new people were out of their homes and involved in a community event, even if the occasion was not a happy one.</p>
   <p>Pastor Pete conducted the service. He kept it non-denominational and didn’t proselytize, but he acknowledged that Mrs. Roth was a Christian. Mary Anne told the story about Mrs. Roth’s absolute lack of fear about dying. That touched a lot of people. Several were crying. Many people at the service were strengthened by Mrs. Roth’s bravery. They knew they might be dying soon, too. They wanted the peace Mrs. Roth had.</p>
   <p>When the service was over, most people stayed and talked. Grant had never seen this before. Sure people talked for a few minutes after a funeral, but not an hour. Grant reminisced that funerals during peacetime—Grant marveled that he was calling the past “peacetime”—ended at a particular time because people had to get back to work or pick up their kids and take them somewhere. There was a hustle and bustle to get back to. Not now. Almost no one had a “job.” In fact, Tammy was the only person Grant knew with anything like a real job. With the gate and Grange guard duties taken care of at the moment, there was really no reason anyone at Pierce Point had to leave. Most of them hadn’t seen anyone other than their neighbors for days.</p>
   <p>People were talking about all the things affecting them. They were making arrangements to share and trade things. “Come on over and we’ll can those,” was something being overheard. Or “I’ve got some .22 shells. I need that old limb that blew over cut up and cut into firewood. Can you come over with your chainsaw?”</p>
   <p>Not everyone was in the sharing and trading mood. Some people, almost all of them new faces who hadn’t been to the Grange meetings, just sat back and watched. Grant got the feeling that they were sizing it all up. They weren’t mentioning they had food or something of value. They either didn’t have much or they were afraid of letting people know that they had anything. Or both. Or maybe they were Loyalists who still thought their government would ride in and save the day.</p>
   <p>Grant tried to mentally catalogue these people. He knew they would be trouble. Probably not violent trouble, but they would be the kind of people who looked to the community to support them without offering to do anything in return. This would be hard for them to pull off because if they wanted a meal card they needed to do something for the community. Grant smiled to himself. The meal card system was a thing of beauty. He was so glad he read that novel that provided the meal card inspiration. He would have never thought of that on his own.</p>
   <p>Grant noticed that a board had gone up at the Grange called “Wanted/For Sale.” It had index cards on it with things people wanted to buy and sell. Grant found Ken Dolphson and showed him the board. Grant suggested that Ken start putting the items on the board in the<emphasis> Pierce Point Patriot</emphasis>. It would boost readership. Ken laughed and said, “I can tell our little economy out here is taking off. I now have competition.” That was good news.</p>
   <p>Grant noticed that more people were wearing pistols. Mostly revolvers and some in makeshift holsters. Others were tucked in belts. There were bulges in pants pockets that Grant surmised were small handguns. The people who had been at the Grange meetings seemed more likely to be armed. None of the new faces had a visible pistol. It was like people were realizing that other people were wearing pistols so it was OK for them to. It was taking time for people to feel comfortable carrying a gun. But they were.</p>
   <p>Before the service, Grant asked the Team to store their ARs out with Chip. He thought it was somehow disrespectful during a religious funeral service to be sitting in the audience with a rifle. For many people, it was the first time they’d seen the Team without their rifles. It added a solemnness and respectful feeling to the service.</p>
   <p>Grant saw Lisa there. She had lots of people meeting her and asking her medical questions. She and the rest of the medical team were giving people good information on the prevention of various things. Tim, the EMT, was organizing a first aid class. Grant would have loved to spend some time with Lisa because that had been so scarce lately. But people were talking to both him and her. And the topics were important. They were both working. That was still hard for Grant to fully comprehend. They no longer had traditional “jobs.” Their duties at Pierce Point were their new jobs.</p>
   <p>Pretty soon, it was 5:00 p.m. The afternoon had flown by. Many of the people were still there. When people don’t have the gas to just drive wherever they want, whenever they want, they tend to stay at a location and get as much done as possible. At the Grange, that meant networking with their neighbors and, as it turned out, squeezing in a meeting while they were there. Several people asked Grant and Rich if they could just have the usual 7:00 pm meeting early so they didn’t need to go home for a while and just come back. Gas was at that much of a premium. If they had a 5:00 p.m. meeting, they could get people out before dinner time and free up the Grange space for the dinners for people working for the community.</p>
   <p>Rich said in a loud voice, “If it’s OK with everyone, we’d like to have a meeting now instead of at 7:00.” Everyone seemed OK with that. It had been long enough since Mrs. Roth’s funeral service that it didn’t seem rude to turn the gathering into a business meeting.</p>
   <p>Rich told the crowd the sanitized version of his trip into town. He kept it positive. He was proud to announce that they had some medical supplies out there, but that people shouldn’t expect the level of medical supplies they had before the Collapse. He asked Lisa to explain. She did, saying, “We have enough for some surgeries, but we will only use supplies on people who really need them.”</p>
   <p>Rich explained about the FCard applications and handed them out. That seemed to brighten up the crowd. A little too much for Grant’s liking.</p>
   <p>Grant, realizing the political implications of the FCards, felt compelled to remind people that the government wasn’t taking care of all their needs. “The FCards are nice, but understand that there isn’t enough on them to fully feed you. The FCards are a supplement to what you have or what you can grow or hunt,” he said.</p>
   <p>That seemed to bother some people, especially the new faces. They initially thought the FCards were a magical solution. They were disappointed to find out they were not. Good. Better to lower their expectations now rather than have them rioting later.</p>
   <p>Rich explained that it was too dangerous for people to go into town and, besides, he had the only armband ID. No one really had gas, either. Rich said a “town run crew” would be formed. They would be the only ones going into town, he said.</p>
   <p>“Are you saying we are forbidden from going into town?” someone asked.</p>
   <p>“Not at all,” Rich said, correcting himself. He didn’t want to appear to be authoritarian. “Be my guest. Burn up your gas. Try to get through the roadblock without one of these,” he said pointing to his armband. “If you get in, let us know how it went,” Rich said semi-sarcastically, which was unlike him. Later Rich would make sure the guards didn’t let anyone go into town except the town run crew. He needed to maintain the “Marines and contractors” story.</p>
   <p>Rich made a mental note to start implying to Bennington and others in town that the Marines and contractors were training off in a separate compound and didn’t mix with the civilians. To further this story, Rich would try to find a piece of land out at Pierce Point that was far away from everyone else and call it the “Training Grounds” or something like that. This would explain why someone from Pierce Point, if they made it into town, might say to the townspeople, “What Marines and contractors?”</p>
   <p>Rich explained that people needed to put in their grocery lists to one person who would pool the lists and come up with one big list for the “town run” people to take into town. Two people volunteered to coordinate the grocery lists for the town runs.</p>
   <p>It was amazing how much administrative work it took to run things like this, Grant thought. Then again, the volunteers doing it spent about one percent the time the government had spent running every aspect of everyone’s lives. But still, administrative things are part of what it takes to survive when there is no government. It’s not all guns and gardening.</p>
   <p>Rich said, “Don’t expect to get anything approaching what you put on your lists. First of all, the store may not have it. Second of all, we can’t spend the gas to go get a particular brand of something you like. When it comes to the FCards, you get what you get. Be glad you got it.”</p>
   <p>“After all, those groceries cost you your bank accounts and 401(k)s,” Grant said. It was a little obnoxious on his part, but he felt compelled to remind people that they should not view the FCards as charity from a benevolent government trying to help them. The FCards were the scraps from all the wealth the government had stolen.</p>
   <p>“Who goes first on getting their orders placed?” someone asked. Good question.</p>
   <p>Grant came up with an answer. “We’ll have a lottery. That’s the only fair way.” He was determined to show that there was no favoritism in anything. That was essential to holding the people together. The slightest rumor of favoritism would tear them apart. “Everyone who has an FCard will get a number and then we’ll draw however many numbers to see whose order gets on the town run.” That seemed to make sense to the crowd.</p>
   <p>Even people who didn’t contribute to the community would be eligible for the town-run lottery. This was because people with FCards who didn’t contribute would start to try to go town themselves and would either get shot or would blow the “fifty Marines” story. Grant didn’t want to push the community contributor thing too far; giving out meal cards was probably as far as he could take it without people getting too upset. Grant always had the ability to sense just how far he could take things politically before he had to accommodate the opposition. He had been doing it since he was a kid.</p>
   <p>Grant figured that people who won the lottery and got their list submitted to the town run crew would not necessarily keep all the food for themselves. They might share some, but they probably would trade some. That’s fine. In fact, that’s the free market at work. It was amazing how capitalism sprung up everywhere, even in a place where the government supposedly controlled everything.</p>
   <p>No government law can override the law of supply and demand. Supply and demand was a natural law, just like the law of gravity. Supply and demand is how the universe was set up to operate, just like gravity. The proof of this was a few feet away from Grant. The government outlawed bribery and the unauthorized selling of medical supplies, but a trunk load of now-illegal guns and ammo got all those medical supplies sitting a few feet from Grant in the locked room of the Grange. That’s all the proof needed to demonstrate the law of supply and demand.</p>
   <p>After discussing the details of the FCard lottery and the town run crew, Rich asked, “We have anything else to talk about?”</p>
   <p>“Yes,” someone said. “Someone busted into my shed.”</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 137</p>
    <p><emphasis>Tweakers</emphasis></p>
    <p>(May 14)</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Yeah, me too,” said another person after the first one said someone had broken into their shed.</p>
   <p>“Yep,” said a third person. “They came into my house.”</p>
   <p>Oh crap. It’s started, Grant thought. He was amazed that they’d gone two weeks without any crime out there. It was only a matter of time.</p>
   <p>Rich, the cop, went into investigator mode. “Where do you guys live?” he asked. They all lived on Frog Lake Road. Right near each other. That’s what Rich feared.</p>
   <p>It was the Richardson house. Those were the meth addicts and assorted “friends.” The Richardson house had been a constant problem for years.</p>
   <p>“Damned tweakers,” someone said. “Tweakers” was a term for meth addicts. Apparently when they got on a multi-day speed high, they would take apart mechanical things and try to put them back together out of nervous energy. They would “tweak” with things, hence the name.</p>
   <p>“What did they take?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“Tools, generators, chainsaws, some gas cans full of gas,” the second man said. He realized after he said it that it might not be good to tell everyone at the Grange about the things he had. Or used to have. Oh well. He wanted to get them back and this was how to do it.</p>
   <p>The third guy, who had them come into his house said, “They got my wife’s jewelry and two of my guns. They left the food, though.”</p>
   <p>That figured. Only meth heads would steal things like that but leave the food since they had no appetite.</p>
   <p>“Do you have any idea who did it?” Rich asked. He wanted to see if there was evidence that it was someone other than the Richardson tweakers.</p>
   <p>“Them damned tweakers,” the second man said. “It’s that damned Richardson house,” he said. “All those low lifes.” The crowd started buzzing.</p>
   <p>Rich wasn’t about to go arrest people on this little evidence. He didn’t want a mob to go after them either. He needed more proof.</p>
   <p>“How do you know it’s the Richardson house people?” Rich asked.</p>
   <p>“I saw one of them,” the third man said. “I saw one of them, a young guy, running out of my yard. I’ve seen him before at the tweaker house. He’s been hanging out there for the past couple weeks.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure?” Grant asked. He didn’t want the vigilante stuff, either. And, as the judge, it was Grant’s job to make sure innocent people weren’t convicted.</p>
   <p>“Positive,” the third man said. “He had the same black hoodie sweatshirt on I’d seen him in before at the Richardson house when he was out in the yard when I drove by. He looked like trouble. He was a new guy out there. I’m positive.”</p>
   <p>Normally Rich would do a lot more investigating before settling on a suspect. No need to turn over every rock on this one. Rich knew the Richardsons and instantly knew they did this.</p>
   <p>Rich pointed to the crime victims and said, “We’ll talk after the meeting. We’ll get the constables together and go get your stuff back.”</p>
   <p>The “constables,” of course, were the Team. Rich wanted to show that the self-government at Pierce Point would be handling things. He didn’t want a mob to form and go after the tweakers, but he wanted to show the crowd that the self-governing Pierce Point community would do something about it. Rich looked over at Grant and Grant looked at the Team. They gave the thumbs-up sign. Looks like they’d be going out to the Richardson place right after the meeting.</p>
   <p>Ryan was worried that the tweakers would get word of an impending raid. So he said to the crowd, “No one here talks to the tweakers. If they get tipped off about this and one of us dies, you will be an accessory to murder.” The room was silent. The seriousness of this was sinking in.</p>
   <p>In the past, before the Collapse, people would just call 911 and let the police take care of this. But now there were no police. They people in the Grange hall were their own police. They had to do this themselves. The upside was that someone would actually do something about this instead of just taking a police report.</p>
   <p>“Next time,” Rich said to the crime victims, “please come to us privately with these reports. We can’t have everyone knowing where we’re about to hit.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, sorry,” the third man said. He hadn’t thought about that. He was just answering Rich’s question about whether there was anything else that needed to be dealt with</p>
   <p>Rich didn’t want the guy feeling bad or worried that the situation was out of control. So he said, “No problem. We’ll handle this after the meeting. This is what the constables do. It’s no big deal.” Actually, it was. Rich and the Team knew it.</p>
   <p>It was a big deal because tweakers were not like other people, Grant thought. The good news was that they would probably be so high and sleep deprived that they couldn’t be too effective with weapons. The bad news was that the meth made them extremely aggressive and fearless. Absolutely fearless. And, at some level, wanting to die. That made them formidable opponents.</p>
   <p>Lisa looked at Grant and mouthed to him, “Don’t go.”</p>
   <p>Oh, great. His wife didn’t want him to go do his job. Not this again. Not this “stay at home like everything is normal,” crap again. He didn’t need this right now.</p>
   <p>The meeting broke up and the crime victims came up to Rich and the Team. Dan sat in on the conversation, too. Some volunteers also came up. “What can we do to help?” one of the volunteers asked. This was the most excitement that there had been in days out at Pierce Point.</p>
   <p>“Get out there right away,” Dan said to the volunteers, “and make sure no one goes in or out of the area by the house. But do it discreetly. Don’t get within earshot of the place. For all we know, someone here called them and tipped them off. No one goes in or out of the area.”</p>
   <p>The volunteers nodded and took off.</p>
   <p>Rich and the others came up with a hasty plan to go out—right then—to the Richardson house and “drop in” as they put it. It was still light out, so this was not the optimal time to do this. But, they didn’t want the tweakers to have any extra time to prepare. It had to be done right now.</p>
   <p>The Team had their full kit with them. Pow tapped the bulletproof plates in his vest and smiled. “This is what they’re for,” he said. That conveyed a sense of the seriousness of the situation.</p>
   <p>The crime victims drew a quick map of the tweaker house. The group decided which way the tweakers would probably try to escape. They tried to find out how many were in there. Were there any kids? People had seen some there, but it was hard to say. People came and went to that place.</p>
   <p>When the plan was laid out, Rich said, “OK, a quick plan is better than no plan. Everyone ready?” The Team nodded.</p>
   <p>They had never actually done this. No one had actually ever shot back at them. They’d been ready to shoot people like at the stopped car during the bug out to Pierce Point and when they went up to Gideon’s truck outside the gate. But they never had.</p>
   <p>It was weird. They weren’t scared. They were excited to finally do what they’d trained for. They were just going to do a job. Well, actually they were a little scared. But none of them could imagine saying, “I’m sitting this one out.”</p>
   <p>Grant looked over at Lisa. She had been listening to the planning. She once again mouthed “Don’t go” to Grant. She wasn’t pissed now. She was scared. She was terrified he would get killed. Grant grabbed his gear and walked by her to get into the truck. He had a job to do.</p>
