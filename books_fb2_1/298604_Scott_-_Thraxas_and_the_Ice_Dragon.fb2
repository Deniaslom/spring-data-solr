   </title>
   <p>It's some years since the last Thraxas novel was published.

    <p><strong>Chapter One</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>We've been stuck on this tiny boat for eight days. We haven't seen land since we drifted away from the shores of Turai. It's rained almost continually and the waves keep threatening to overwhelm us. I'm cold, wet, and fed up with everything.</p>
   <p>If you have to be stuck on a small boat in the middle of the ocean, Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, is not a bad companion. Her sorcery has at least kept us supplied with food. When Lisutaris snaps her fingers, fish just surrender. It saves a lot of messing around with fishing lines. She can purify water with another minor spell, so we won't die of thirst. Unfortunately, Lisutaris has no mastery over the ocean currents, and not enough power over the wind to be able to guide us back to the shore. We're drifting along, not knowing where, if anywhere, we're going to land.</p>
   <p>The City of Turai was under siege. We'd hoped to hold out till help arrived, but we failed. Turai fell to the Orcs. Their Sorcerers nullified our defences and Lord Rezaz the Butcher smashed through the north wall with his Orcish army. I escaped in the chaos, bringing Lisutaris and Makri with me. Lisutaris has been depressed from the moment she got on board. She's head of the Sorcerers Guild and one of the strongest users of magic in the West. It was her responsibility to protect the city from Orcish sorcery and she failed. In her defence, she was struck down by illness; even so, she blames herself.</p>
   <p>Makri, ex-gladiator and part-time barmaid, is an even less equitable companion. She's furious that she left the city without a fight. I think she actually blames me for rescuing her. The fact that Makri was so ill with the winter malady she was unable to walk, let along fight, doesn't prevent her from cursing herself for leaving Turai without striking a blow in its defence.</p>
   <p>The boat's tiny cabins give scant protection from the cold winter rain, and we've been lurching alarmingly in the heavy swell. These seas are notoriously bad during the winter months and it's something of a miracle that we haven't been swallowed up by a storm. Our single sail is torn and ragged, making steering almost impossible, something which Makri has found occasion to complain about.</p>
   <p>«Couldn't you have found a boat that was properly equipped?»</p>
   <p>«You think I had time to hunt around for a better boat? If I hadn't got us out of there quickly we'd have been dead on the beach with a dragon picking our bones.»</p>
   <p>«Your bones maybe,» says Makri. «I'd have gutted any dragon that came near me.»</p>
   <p>«You couldn't even walk.»</p>
   <p>«Well I can walk now,» Makri retorts, and strides around the deck. «Can't you take us back?» she demands, turning to Lisutaris. «Work a spell or something?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shrugs. She's already explained that while she can manipulate the weather to some degree, she doesn't have enough power over the wind to carry us back to land. None of us are much good as sailors. I've travelled the oceans in my time, but always as a soldier, never as a crewman. Makri has only ever made one voyage, to the Elvish Islands, and she was constantly sea-sick. As for Lisutaris, she's far more comfortable in the city. None of us have any bright ideas for escaping our predicament.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Two</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>The next day arrives, dull, overcast, and windless. I wake up shivering. I brought my magic warm cloak with me, but we've been sharing it. Lisutaris slept in it last night. I stride out onto the deck.</p>
   <p>«I've had enough of this,» I declare. «I'm as cold as a frozen pixie, not to mention wet as a mermaid's blanket. I'm stuck on a small boat with no beer, a depressed Sorcerer and an angry barbarian woman. I'm sick of it.»</p>
   <p>I look up at the sky, and offer up a prayer to whichever Gods might be watching in these parts.</p>
   <p>«How about taking us back to land?»</p>
   <p>Nothing happens. We remain becalmed. I start to feel annoyed, and shake my fist at the sky. «I demand you take this boat back to shore!»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris arrives on deck and looks at me questioningly. «What are you doing?»</p>
   <p>«I'm demanding that the Gods take us back to land.»</p>
   <p>«That's going to work,» grunts the Sorcerer, and sits down wearily at the side of the boat. «I'll catch us some fish for breakfast.»</p>
   <p>«I don't want fish. I'm fed up with fish. I want beer and I want to get back ashore.»</p>
   <p>I start shaking my fist at the sky again. «Saint Quatinius? How about some help? We built statues of you all over Turai. Shouldn't you be doing something in return? I can't keep going on fish much longer. I need meat. And beer. A lot of beer.»</p>
   <p>We remain becalmed. I feel irritated at Saint Quatinius. As a patron saint he's really not much help. Makri appears from her cabin, shivering.</p>
   <p>«Who is Thraxas shouting at?»</p>
   <p>«Saint Quatinius.»</p>
   <p>«Has he gone mad?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris nods. «He seems to have. Too much fish.»</p>
   <p>«We'd still have some venison left if he'd been able to control himself.»</p>
   <p>I glare at Makri. When we fled the city, I did have the foresight to bring along a large joint of venison. Properly rationed, it might have lasted for some time. Perhaps unwisely, I ate it all in one night, feeling in need of some proper sustenance.</p>
   <p>«So I ate all the venison. A man of my proportions can't keep going on fish. I need meat. And beer.»</p>
   <p>I shake my fist at the sky again, and complain to Saint Quatinius.</p>
   <p>«You couldn't expect Thraxas to go for a week without beer without cracking up,» says Makri, sitting down next to Lisutaris to share the warm cloak.</p>
   <p>I glare at her. «At least I'm trying to do something.»</p>
   <p>«Do what? None of us even believe in Saint Quatinius.»</p>
   <p>I gaze up to the sky. «Please do not abandon me because of this Orcish infidel, great Saint Quatinius. It's not my fault she doesn't believe in you.»</p>
   <p>«Hey!» yells Makri. «I'm not an Orc. And stop shouting to that imaginary saint.»</p>
   <p>«Ignore her, Saint Quatinius. Do not punish an honest Turanian citizen because he has the misfortune to be cast adrift with an unbelieving Orc.»</p>
   <p>Makri storms up and stands in front of me. «Will you stop calling me an Orc!»</p>
   <p>Makri has one quarter Orcish blood. It can be a sensitive subject.</p>
   <p>«Maybe if you said a prayer as well we might get somewhere.»</p>
   <p>Makri sneers. «I don't believe in your Western gods.»</p>
   <p>«Well how about your Orcish ones?»</p>
   <p>«I don't believe in them either.»</p>
   <p>I raise my hands in supplication. «You see what I have to put up with, Saint Quatinius? Send me back to land and I'll donate money to the nearest church.»</p>
   <p>Makri growls in frustration. She looks up at the grey clouds above. «Saint Quatinius, I'll start believing in you if you just get me ashore so I can escape from this oaf.»</p>
   <p>At that moment a wind springs up. Lisutaris rises to her feet. «It's coming from the south. If this keeps up it might get us back to land.»</p>
   <p>«Aha!» says Makri, and looks smug. «Now who's the unbeliever?»</p>
   <p>«What do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«It was my prayer that brought the wind.»</p>
   <p>«Stop talking nonsense,» I say.</p>
   <p>«Nonsense? I didn't see the saints paying any attention to you shaking your fist. Hardly surprising. Then I make a polite request and here we are, on our way.» She turns to Lisutaris. «You remember that time I stopped the rain in Turai? Do you think I might have some hidden religious powers?»</p>
   <p>I shake my head in disgust, then march to the bow to peer into the distance, hoping for a glimpse of land. There's no telling how far south we've drifted in the past week, but now at least we're heading in the right direction.</p>
   <p>«So how much money do you have in mind?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Pardon?»</p>
   <p>«You promised to donate to the church if Saint Quatinius took us back to land.»</p>
   <p>«If we make it ashore I'll give it some thought.»</p>
   <p>Shrouded in mist, we drift northwards for a long time. Such a long time that I start to worry.</p>
   <p>«What if we've gone so far west that there isn't any land left? We might just carry on till we»</p>
   <p>I let the sentence hang unfinished. Makri looks at me.</p>
   <p>«I keep telling you Thraxas, the world is round. You can't fall off the edge.»</p>
   <p>«I don't see why you're so sure about that.»</p>
   <p>«I heard Samanatius prove it with logic and mathematics.»</p>
   <p>«That old fraud?» I snort with derision at Samanatius. He was Turai's leading philosopher, according to Makri. But he's most probably dead, along with any number of people we used to know. Gurd, Captain Rallee, Tanrose, all my old companions. Who knows what happened to them when the city fell? Lisutaris can't be sure that any of her fellow Sorcerers escaped. The Orcs overwhelmed us so suddenly that even the most powerful might have fallen. I feel the spirit draining from me. Makri is keen to march back to Turai the moment she reaches land, and take up the fight again. Myself, I'm not so sure. I'm wondering about just heading to the furthest West, and looking for somewhere peaceful to live.</p>
   <p>«Land ahead,» says Makri</p>
   <p>As well as her Orcish blood, Makri also has some Elvish in her. Her eyesight is far better than ours. Lisutaris and I peer through the ocean mist, but we can't see anything. We wait anxiously as we drift northwards. Finally a thin line appears on the dim horizon.</p>
   <p>«The orange cliffs,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>The orange cliffs of Samsarina. A well known landmark. We haven't come nearly as far west as I feared. Just two countries along from Turai, in fact. Only Simnia separates us from home.</p>
   <p>«At least we're not landing in Simnia,» I mutter.</p>
   <p>«What are the Samsarinans like?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Not as bad as the Simnians. Which doesn't mean they're all that great.»</p>
   <p>As we drift in towards Samsarina, Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, is pensive. It's weighing heavily on her mind that Turai fell while she was head of the Sorcerers Guild. I'd say she's being hard on herself. There were plenty of worse failures in the city. Our Royal Family, the intelligence services, the army. None of them covered themselves with glory. I did my part, of course, but as for the rest of the degenerate population, they crumbled under the pressure.</p>
   <p>«News of Turai's fall will have reached here by now,» mutters Lisutaris. «I'm probably assumed to be dead. Lasat Axe of Gold will be rubbing his hands at the prospect of a new election.»</p>
   <p>It's unfortunate for Lisutaris that we're heading into Samsarina, where Lasat is the Chief Sorcerer. During the recent election for Head of the Sorcerers Guild, the Turanian government blackmailed him to ensure Lisutaris's victory. I doubt he'll give us a friendly reception. Lisutaris lights up a thazis stick. She glances at the pouch in her hand. «I'm running out of thazis.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris is a devotee of thazis. Normally a mild narcotic, the Sorcerer has taken its consumption to new levels. She's developed spells to make the plants grow faster, producing a much stronger variety than is commonly available. I doubt she could function without it. I have a notion that thazis might not be so tolerated in Samsarina as it was in Turai, but decide not to mention it. We drift in towards the Orange Cliffs.</p>
   <p>«I've been here before,» says Lisutaris. «We're not far from the port of Orosis. I know the harbour Sorcerer, Kublinos.»</p>
   <p>«So what's Samsarina like?» asks Makri. «Is it like Turai?»</p>
   <p>I shake my head. «Not at all. It's mostly farmland. Barons and peasants. Though it's quite wealthy. Good farmland.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris agrees with me. «It's not like Turai. No Senate, no Consul, no theatres, no university. Just a King and a lot of Barons vying for influence. Old-fashioned compared to our city.» Lisutaris purses her lips. «Their Sorcerers didn't like it when a woman was elected Head of the Guild.»</p>
   <p>«Cheer up,» I tell her. «We're war refugees. They're bound to sympathise.»</p>
   <p>«They won't sympathise if they think we let the Orcs beat us without a fight.»</p>
   <p>«Without a fight?» I scoff. «No one has ever accused Thraxas of giving up without a fight. Thraxas Dragon Heart, they used to call me.»</p>
   <p>«No they didn't,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Yes they did. I tell you Makri, you're in for a surprise. Don't forget, I won the sword-fighting championship in Samsarina. I doubt I'll be able to walk down the street without people recognising me. Wouldn't surprise me if they've put up a statue.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks at me dubiously. The sword-fighting championship in Samsarina is the most renowned contest of arms in the West. Makri never quite believes me when I tell her that I won it, twenty or so years ago. Of course I was in better shape in those days. Not so large around the waist.</p>
   <p>«Just concentrate on not outraging the natives Makri, and we'll be fine. Don't act like a mad woman, a mad Orc, or any combination of the two. And keep your pointy ears hidden.»</p>
   <p>«You'll offend them a lot quicker than me, you fat oaf,» retorts Makri. «How long till you're rolling around drunk?»</p>
   <p>«That depends on how far we are from the nearest supply of beer.»</p>
   <p>We drift slowly along the shore till the port of Orosis comes into view, large and grey, its sombre harbour walls protecting ships from the harsh winter conditions.</p>
   <p>«I'll be glad to get ashore,» says Lisutaris. «I'm sick of eating fish.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Three</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>We come to rest on a grey, shingled beach a little way west of the harbour walls. A few seabirds squawk noisily overhead as we arrive. It's a cold morning and the sky is dull. Though we're nearing the end of winter there's no sign of the temperature rising.</p>
   <p>«We should find Kublinos,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>We set off in search of the Harbour Sorcerer. The shingle crunches under our feet as we scramble along the shore. At the end of the beach we're faced with a problem. The harbour walls sweep up towards the cliffs, leaving no gap.</p>
   <p>«How do we get in?» asks Makri, and looks towards Lisutaris as if the Sorcerer might levitate us over the walls.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris purses her lips. «I'm not sure. Is there a gate?» She takes out her pouch of thazis and frowns as she rolls herself a small stick. «Just as well we reached civilisation. I've almost run out.»</p>
   <p>«I wouldn't get your hopes up,» I tell her. «Thazis is illegal in Samsarina.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks at me sharply. «I'm sure a supply will be forthcoming for the Head of the Sorcerers Guild.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe. Maybe not. Anyway, you probably shouldn't be smoking it when we arrive.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris ignores me, and smokes her thazis stick as we walk along the foot of the walls. Finally we come to a small, locked door. Makri pounds on it. Nothing happens. Lisutaris frowns.</p>
   <p>«I didn't cross the ocean in a leaky boat just to stand around on a cold beach for the rest of my life.»</p>
   <p>She raises her hand to cast a spell — which, I'm thinking, might not be the wisest thing to do, as no one likes having their harbour defences breached by strangers — when the door abruptly opens and a uniformed man stares at us suspiciously.</p>
   <p>«Who are you?» he demands. Behind him I can see a few more guards with their weapons ready.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, Head of the Sorcerers Guild,» announces Lisutaris, grandly. «Take us to Harbour Sorcerer Kublinos.»</p>
   <p>To our surprise, the guard bursts out laughing. «You don't look like a Sorcerer.» He turns his eyes on Makri, who, with her reddish skin, vast main of dark hair, pierced nose and man's tunic, does make for an unusual sight.</p>
   <p>«What are you supposed to be?»</p>
   <p>«Makri. Bodyguard to Lisutaris.»</p>
   <p>This produces further mirth. I shove my way to the front. «Do you have beer?»</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«Beer.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris turns her head towards me. «Could the beer wait for a moment, Thraxas?» she says, quite frostily. «Guards, take us to Kublinos. Turai has fallen and I must consult with your Sorcerers.»</p>
   <p>The guards let us through the gate, though they're still suspicious. Lisutaris is famous throughout the West, but I'm not sure that they believe the bedraggled figure at their gates really is her. I keep an eye out for beer as we're led through the walls and into a guard house. There's a long delay while soldiers and lieutenants come and go, asking Lisutaris questions, and sending off messages. Lisutaris comes close to losing her temper, and informs the lieutenant that if he doesn't hurry things along she'll prove who she is by causing his head to explode. As she's now looking angry enough to do it, he gets the message, and rushes off to fetch Kublinos.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris grunts in annoyance. «I knew Samsarina would be like this,» she mutters to Makri. «If you think women have a hard time in Turai, wait till you've been here a while.»</p>
   <p>I'm distracted by the sound of clashing swords. Several men are practicing their fighting technique in the courtyard below.</p>
   <p>«Officers make you practice a lot?» I ask the guard who's been left with us.</p>
   <p>«That's Basinos, sword fighting champion of the southern armies. He's getting ready for the tournament.»</p>
   <p>Of course, the great sword fighting tournament. I hadn't realised it was so close.</p>
   <p>«Is he a favourite?» I'm always keen to pick up tips in case there's an opportunity for gambling.</p>
   <p>«One of the best in Samsarina. But there are a lot of good fighters. I'd say Elupus the Simnian will win it again this year.»</p>
   <p>I've heard of Elupus, of course. He's won tournaments all over the West. Makri comes over to watch. After studying Basinos's combat technique for a few seconds, she makes a small sound of derision.</p>
   <p>«His defence is weak,» she says. «I'd send him packing soon enough.»</p>
   <p>The guard grins at me. Makri might be carrying two swords and an axe but he obviously doesn't imagine she knows how to use them. I grin back at him, because it's just struck me that while Makri is one of the most lethal sword-fighters ever to enter an arena, she's completely unknown in Samsarina. If she were to enter the tournament, no one would give her a chance. The bookmakers' odds would be immense. A man could make a fine profit by backing her.</p>
   <p>Finally an officer arrives to take us to Kublinos. «Send ahead for beer,» I tell him, but I don't think he's really paying attention. He leads us through narrow streets lined with fish vendors and sail-makers' shops. As we turn a corner he indicates a large, rather splendid looking building in the distance.</p>
   <p>«Kublinos's official residence.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris draws herself up as we approach. Bedraggled or not, she still exudes power and dignity as she strides through the gate of Kublinos's residence, where we're greeted by a uniformed attendant.</p>
   <p>«Tell Kublinos that Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky is here.»</p>
   <p>«And we need beer immediately,» I add.</p>
   <p>«Pardon?» The servant looks confused.</p>
   <p>«We need beer. The head of the Sorcerers Guild has just survived a dangerous voyage across the ocean. I'm shocked that no one yet has offered us beer. Bring flagons.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris purses her lips. «My eh… Chief Adviser Thraxas… is…» She shakes her head. «Just give him some beer. And take me to Kublinos.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris and Makri disappear down the purple carpet that leads to the main staircase while I head downstairs with a kitchen servant.</p>
   <p>«Does the Sorcerer require any particular sort of beer?» he enquires.</p>
   <p>«Hard to say. Just bring them all and I'll sample them. And don't stint on the flagons, keep bringing them till I tell you to stop.»</p>
   <p>I will say this for the Samsarinans — they may be a bunch of rural bumpkins who spend most of their time plodding along in fields, but they do produce some fine beer. Dark and full of flavour. With six or seven flagons inside me, and the remnants of four loaves of bread on the table, I start to feel more like myself again. For the first time since I was forced to flee Turai, life seems not quite so hopeless.</p>
   <p>«Of course,» I say, quite loudly, to the servant who brings me my eighth flagon. «You can't blame a man for feeling hopeless if he's stuck on a boat with a crazy Orc, a depressed Sorcerer, and no beer. Stronger spirits than mine would have quailed. Do you have any more bread? A few yams maybe?»</p>
   <p>I notice my flagon is empty. «What's the matter? Is there a beer shortage? The Head of the Sorcerers Guild isn't going to be pleased when she hears you've been stingy with the ale.»</p>
   <p>It seems to me that the servant is a little tardy in bringing my ninth large flagon, but I don't make a fuss. After all, I'm a guest in this country. To show my appreciation of their hospitality, I rise to my feet, fling my arm round his shoulder and draw him close.</p>
   <p>«You Samsarinans are not as bad as everyone says. Fine beer you have. Clears a man's head. You know, when I was on that boat I thought of packing it all in. Just let the Orcs walk over us. But now» I take out my sword. The servant, possibly misinterpreting this, attempts to wriggle free. — «I'll chase these damned Orcs all the way back to the dirt hills they came from. Right after you've brought me more beer. Try using a decent sized tankard this time. And more food, damn it, don't you know how to treat a guest in this country? Where's Lisutaris? I'm her adviser, I should be advising her.»</p>
   <p>The servant hands me another flagon of ale, then leads me back upstairs, where he shows me into a reception room and asks me to wait. I'm in no mood for waiting. I march swiftly through the large door in front of me, arriving in a stateroom containing Makri, Lisutaris, Kublinos the Harbour Sorcerer, and a few others.</p>
   <p>«We've wasted enough time on these pointless discussions!» I cry, banging my sword on the huge ornate desk in the middle of the room. «It's time for action! We need to organise an army and march back to Turai.»</p>
   <p>There's a brief silence. One of the men in the room, a beefy individual with blunt features and longish grey hair, looks at me in surprise, then turns to Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Who is this?»</p>
   <p>«My Chief Adviser,» says Lisutaris, wearily.</p>
   <p>«That's right!» I say. «And I advise you to stop talking and start marching.»</p>
   <p>Suddenly I feel quite suspicious of the grey-haired man. «Have you been talking about surrendering? Samsarinans never did have the stomach for a fight.»</p>
   <p>«How dare you talk to Baron Mabados like that!» cries an official with a fancy chain round his neck. I ignore him, having noticed a woman in a red gown standing in the doorway. She looks vaguely familiar. Possibly a servant I met on the way in.</p>
   <p>«Could you bring me some beer? A flagon or two will do for now.»</p>
   <p>«Thraxas!» yells Lisutaris. «That is Baroness Demelzos.»</p>
   <p>I focus my eyes on the woman. Aquiline features, fancy sort of tiara-like thing stuck in her hair. I suppose she might be a Baroness.</p>
   <p>«Is everybody in this room a member of the aristocracy? Isn't there anyone useful who might bring me a beer? They were quiet stingy in the kitchens.»</p>
   <p>«My kitchens are not stingy!» says Kublinos, offended.</p>
   <p>At that moment, weakened perhaps by the rigours of my sea journey, a greet tiredness overwhelms me, and I'm forced to take a seat at the table. It's a fine comfy seat, plushly upholstered in soft brown leather. As I drift off to sleep I'm still feeling some resentment towards the Samsarinans for their frugal hospitality.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Four</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I waken in a surprisingly comfortable bed. Soft mattress, feathered pillow and plenty of blankets. I can't remember how I got there. I'm still straining my memory when the door bursts open and Makri enters. I nod at her genially. Normally I find it annoying when Makri arrives without knocking — growing up in the Orcish Gladiator pits, she never learned any manners — but I let it pass.</p>
   <p>«Good morning,» I say.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas you cusux,» she barks, using a foul Orcish obscenity very rarely heard in the West. «Could you possibly be any more of a fool? No, you couldn't. You're number one chariot among fools.» She leans over the bed. «Do you have any idea of the trouble you've caused? Lisutaris is trying to organise a war against the Orcs and you almost ruin everything because you couldn't wait five minutes before getting drunk and behaving abominably.»</p>
   <p>I spread my hands wide. «I was on a boat for eight days. I needed a beer or two. Anyway, I'm sure you're exaggerating.»</p>
   <p>«Exaggerating? You accused Baron Mabados of being coward! And mistook his wife for a serving wench! Lisutaris has got enough problems without having to cover for your oafishness.»</p>
   <p>I attempt to protest but am unable to get a word in.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas. Stop talking, stop complaining, stop drinking, and get your obscenely fat carcass out of that bed. We're sailing up-river to Elath with the Baron and Kublinos to see the King. The barge leaves in ten minutes but if you'd rather stay here and roll around drunk in a tavern, no one will miss you.»</p>
   <p>Makri storms out. I get out of bed with a struggle, cross to the small sink in the adjoining room, and splash water over myself. No one is leaving me behind. I've been in Elath before. It's a small town not far from the capital, known for its hot mineral baths. It's also the place where they hold the sword-fighting contest. I have to rush to get ready before the barge leaves, but an old campaigner like myself is used to moving in a hurry. No more than ten minutes after Makri's appearance, I'm rolling up to the quay with a small keg of beer under one arm and a bag of bread and pastries under the other.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas,» says Lisutaris, glancing at me frostily as I stroll on board. «You made it.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris has made a swift return to her former elegance. I wouldn't say she was ever classed among Turai's greatest beauties, but she's a very attractive woman, always well presented; expensive robes, nicely coiffured hair and so on. Makri has also tidied herself up, though in her case that just means wearing an even more unsuitable man's tunic, brushing her ludicrously huge mane of hair in approximately the same direction, and cleaning her weapons. She now stands on deck with a sword at each hip and an axe at her belt, looking like the savage she is. Her appearance, reckoned as strange even in cosmopolitan Turai, is even more outlandish here among the solid citizens of Samsarina. In Turai, which borders on the wastelands, it's not unknown for a few people with Orcish blood to appear every now and then, but in Samsarina, I'd guess it's virtually unheard of. Crewmen eye her warily, probably wondering if she's the advance guard for the Orcish invasion. I offer her some breakfast out of the bag I'm carrying but she refuses, either because she's still annoyed with me or because she never eats that much anyway. Makri never complained of hunger when we were castaway. It's another odd trait.</p>
   <p>Also on-board is the Sorcerer Kublinos. I greet him genially. He doesn't respond. Obviously he hasn't been impressed by his first experience of Thraxas, private investigator and warrior. I brush it off. He'll soon come to appreciate my finer points, as I say to Makri in the cabin below decks.</p>
   <p>«You don't have any finer points,» replies Makri.</p>
   <p>«What's got into you? All right, I got drunk. So what? It's not the end of the world.»</p>
   <p>Makri's face softens a little. «I suppose not. Though it was crass, even by your standards. I'm on edge anyway. Everyone here keeps staring at me like I'm a freak. And I don't like the way Baron Mabados spoke to Lisutaris. I'm getting the impression the Samsarinans don't think she did enough to keep the Orcs out of Turai. It's ridiculous. Lisutaris was sick when the attack came. Anyway, if it hadn't been for her warnings, the city would have fallen sooner.»</p>
   <p>That's true enough; Lisutaris was the only one to correctly foresee the Orcish attack. Without her warnings, the city would have fallen earlier. But it looks bad for her that when Turai did eventually fall, it was because Deeziz the Unseen, most powerful of the Orcish Sorcerers, managed to sneak into the city undetected. Her sorcery outwitted everyone, including Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Have you been to Elath?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Yes. It's just a small town in the foothills. No one would go there if it wasn't for the hot baths. Have you thought about entering the sword-fighting tournament?»</p>
   <p>Makri shakes her head. «Tournaments are foolish.»</p>
   <p>Makri was involved in a tournament in the Elvish Isles. She trained a young Elf, very effectively, but had little patience for a fighting competition in which only practice weapons were used.</p>
   <p>«This tournament isn't like the junior Elves' tournament,» I explain. «They used wooden swords because the Elves didn't want their children getting hacked to pieces. This is more serious.»</p>
   <p>«With real weapons?»</p>
   <p>«Not quite,» I admit. «The points are blunted, and contestants generally wear enough armour to prevent them being killed. But it's serious enough. Plenty of injuries, and a few deaths on occasion.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks disgusted. While she's an enthusiastic fighter, the idea of not doing it for real doesn't appeal to her.</p>
   <p>«You can't tell who's the best fighter with blunt swords and a lot of foolish rules. Either you fight properly or you don't. I'm not getting involved in some pointless sham.»</p>
   <p>I find her attitude annoying. Makri's always got to make out she's the only one who knows anything about fighting. «It's not a sham, it's a tough contest. It takes a special sort of skill to win it.»</p>
   <p>Makri raises her eyebrows. «Like you did twenty years ago?»</p>
   <p>«Exactly.»</p>
   <p>«It's strange that no one else in Turai knew about this triumph.»</p>
   <p>«I told you. I had to enter under a false name because I was absent without leave from my unit. Wait till we get to Elath, there will be plenty of people who remember old Thraxas, terror of the fighting arena. Of course, if you're too scared to enter…»</p>
   <p>«Your pathetic attempts to make me angry won't work, Thraxas. I'm not entering. I don't want to. Anyway, I'm too busy being Lisutaris's bodyguard.»</p>
   <p>«But it's a wasted opportunity. You should enter.»</p>
   <p>«Why do you care?»</p>
   <p>«You'll enjoy it.»</p>
   <p>«No I won't.»</p>
   <p>«Yes you will. Besides, think of the gambling opportunities.»</p>
   <p>«Aha!» yells Makri. «I knew you just wanted to gamble!»</p>
   <p>«What's wrong with that? Think of the odds we'll get. An unknown woman entering the greatest tournament in the West? We might get something like a hundred to one. Can we, as responsible citizens, refuse odds of a hundred to one?»</p>
   <p>Makri looks momentarily interested. When she first arrived in Turai she had no interest in gambling. Since then I've managed to improve her character somewhat. These days she can get excited about a good wager. She sets her mouth firmly against it.</p>
   <p>«No. I'm here to help Lisutaris rally the Sorcerers, get the armies organised and march against the Orcs. I'm not getting distracted by anything else.» Makri looks angry again. «Lisutaris is worried they might not even acknowledge her as head of the Sorcerers Guild any more. Kublinos heard that Lasat's already suggested he should be the new chief.»</p>
   <p>This makes me frown, though it's not really a surprise. If the Sorcerers Guild believed that Lisutaris had perished, they'd need a new leader quickly, and there would be no time to organise a proper election. Lasat Axe of Gold would be the obvious choice. The Samsarinan Sorcerer has acted as temporary Head of the Guild before.</p>
   <p>I shrug. «Well, now Lisutaris is alive, there's no problem. She's still Head of the Guild.»</p>
   <p>«She has to be War Leader too,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Now you're getting ahead of yourself. It'll take a lot of discussions and negotiations before they choose a War Leader.»</p>
   <p>«I won't put up with any nonsense,» says Makri. «Lisutaris is going to lead an army straight back to Turai.»</p>
   <p>I don't disillusion her, but it's unlikely to be that simple. The armies of the western nations have had some time to prepare for the Orcish assault but I doubt if they're ready yet. Then there's the Elves to consider. We don't have much chance of defeating Prince Amrag without them on our side, and it'll take them a while to sail up from the Southern Isles. It could be months before we're in a position to attack. Even then, it's by no means certain that the disparate forces of the West will put the retaking of Turai at the top of their priorities. They might decide just to hold the line at the Simnian border, and wait for Amrag to come to us.</p>
   <p>Makri is irate at the thought. «So we just give up the city? Leave Turai in the hands of the Orcs? I can't believe anyone would think of doing that.»</p>
   <p>«Since when did you love Turai so much?»</p>
   <p>«Since I got into the Imperial University,» replies Makri. «The Deputy Consul said I could go and I'm going, even if I have to throw the Orcs out myself.»</p>
   <p>Well, it's a point of view, I suppose. Makri was studying at the Guild Community College. She was the top student there. Academically, she's now qualified to attend the university. In reality, she had no chance of going, because she's female and she has Orcish blood, two things which absolutely disqualify anyone from attending. However, after her considerable service to Turai during the siege, Deputy Consul Cicerius did say he'd use his influence to allow it. But Cicerius is probably dead, and I don't know if there will ever be another class at the university.</p>
   <p>The cabin door opens with a bang and Lisutaris strides into the room, her rainbow cloak flapping around her legs. She looks agitated.</p>
   <p>«This is more serious than I thought,» she says.</p>
   <p>«Have the Orcs advanced?»</p>
   <p>«No, I can't get any thazis anywhere. Can you believe it's completely outlawed in Samsarina? Damn this new King and his anti-thazis policies.» Lisutaris gazes with concern at her almost-empty thazis pouch. «Even Kublinos doesn't have any. Have you ever known a Sorcerer without any thazis? What's the matter with these Samsarinans?»</p>
   <p>I nod in sympathy. «They're strange. Have you noticed how they don't seem to have much beer around?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris sits down heavily and looks glumly at her shoes. She seems to have borrowed a nice pair, probably from the Baroness. They aren't cheering her up any, even though she's a woman who does like shoes.</p>
   <p>«Is there any war news?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«I really thought Kublinos would have some thazis somewhere,» says Lisutaris. «There had better be some in Elath, or there's going to be trouble.» She rises to her feet. «I'm Head of the Sorcerers Guild, damn it! You can't expect me to obey every petty little law in a no-account country like Samsarina.»</p>
   <p>«There will be thazis in Elath,» I say, reassuringly. «It's just a matter of knowing how to find it. I'll sort it out.»</p>
   <p>«Will you?» says Lisutaris, eagerly. «Good. As my Chief Adviser, this is your number one priority.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not actually your Chief Adviser.»</p>
   <p>«Well now I'm appointing you as a wartime emergency.»</p>
   <p>«Is there a salary?»</p>
   <p>«No,» snaps Lisutaris. «You just do it as your patriotic duty. And that duty is to find me thazis so I can function.» She peers out the small window. «I wonder if this barge can go any faster? Maybe I could work some sort of spell…»</p>
   <p>Makri looks frustrated. «About the war?»</p>
   <p>«Yes I know there's a war,» says Lisutaris. «You don't have to go on about it.»</p>
   <p>«Don't get angry with me because you're running out of thazis,» protests Makri «You're as bad as Thraxas and his continual craving for beer.»</p>
   <p>«What?» roars Lisutaris «Didn't you once collapse in Quintessence Street because you'd taken enough dwa to knock out a dragon?»</p>
   <p>Makri purses her lips. Dwa is a much more powerful drug than thazis. «That was only one time,» she says. «It hardly counts.»</p>
   <p>«One time?» I scoff. «And the rest. Who was it that vomited over the floor at the Sorcerers Assemblage?»</p>
   <p>«Almost everybody,» retorts Makri. «After the Turanians drugged and poisoned them all.»</p>
   <p>«The fact is, Makri, you're no more sober than anybody else.»</p>
   <p>«I'm much more sober that you. How can you compare the occasional experiment with dwa with your continual heavy drinking?»</p>
   <p>«I prefer to think of it as moderate indulgence. It's not like I'm addicted. Like Lisutaris with thazis, for instance.»</p>
   <p>«What?» yells Lisutaris. «You dare to criticise me? You haven't been sober in the last fifteen years.»</p>
   <p>«Well,» comes a voice from the cabin door. «Perhaps it's no surprise that Turai fell so easily to the Orcs.»</p>
   <p>It's Baron Mabados. He brushes away a few strands of his long grey hair, enabling him to fix his glare firmly on me. He's a very large man, tall and brawny. The sort of Baron who's used to leading his men into battle.</p>
   <p>«I see you decided to accompany us,» he growls.</p>
   <p>«I did.»</p>
   <p>«Take care your manners improve.» His eyes flicker towards Makri. If anything, his look of distaste becomes even more intense.</p>
   <p>«Is it customary for your serving girl to carry a sword?» he barks at Lisutaris. Not waiting for an answer, he tells Lisutaris that Kublinos has invited her to share his table.</p>
   <p>«Decent of him,» I say, affably, and head for the door. The Baron flings out an arm out to prevent me leaving.</p>
   <p>«The invitation is for the Head of the Sorcerers Guild only.» And with that, the Baron leaves.</p>
   <p>«He called me a serving girl!» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«How dare they not invite me to eat with them,» I protest.</p>
   <p>«Oh be quiet,» says Lisutaris, irritably. «I'll make sure someone sends you food.» She departs, leaving Makri and I to reflect that so far, we don't like Samsarina.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Five</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>We sail upriver past endless tracts of farmland, dotted with the occasional farmhouse and not much else. Since leaving the Port of Orosis we've hardly seen so much as a village. The bare fields stretching off into the distance make for a bleak sight. I try to enlist Lisutaris's support in encouraging Makri to enter the tournament, but the Sorcerer is by turns irritable and depressed, and I can't get her interested. I notice that Kublinos the Harbour Sorcerer does make an effort to cheer her up, joining her at the rails of the barge, making the odd Sorcerer's joke and so on, but it has little effect. Lisutaris is as miserable as a Niojan whore and nothing can shake her gloom. Makri paces the decks, angry about everything. I spend most of my time in my cabin, drinking from my beer keg and trying not to think about all the people I knew in Turai.</p>
   <p>We've been travelling for two days when Makri suddenly yells, and points to the sky. «A dragon!»</p>
   <p>I look up. I can't see any sign of a dragon. The Orcs surprised us by bringing dragons to attack Turai in winter but I wouldn't have thought they could make it this far. Makri seems certain, however, and and rushes off to fetch Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I can't see anything,» says Lisutaris, peering into the grey sky.</p>
   <p>By this time Baron Mabados and Kublinos, accompanied by an assortment of crewmen, servants and soldiers, are spilling onto the deck.</p>
   <p>«There's nothing there,» declares Kublinos.</p>
   <p>«The woman's imagining things,» says a soldier, sneering in Makri's direction.</p>
   <p>I'm not sneering. Makri has Elvish blood, and Elvish eyesight.</p>
   <p>«Are you all blind?» demands Makri. «It's right there.»</p>
   <p>She points up at the white sky and finally, to general terror and amazement, we see what she's talking about. A large dragon has just broken cloud cover and is streaking across the sky. It was hard to spot because it's white. I've never seen that before. Dragons come in grey, dark green, and bronze. Occasionally a sort of dull, dark silver. Never white. Apart from this one. The sight causes panic. Soldiers scramble for their longbows and crossbows, while the non-military men take cover.</p>
   <p>«Shall we make for the shore?» the captain asks Kublinos.</p>
   <p>Kublinos doesn't seem sure what to do. I'm guessing he's never been in action against a full-sized war dragon before. The first time you see one, it's a disturbing sight.</p>
   <p>«Get ready to repel an attack,» yells Lisutaris, who's faced dragons many times. She strides to an open piece of deck, hands hanging loosely by her sides. «Archers, get ready to fire once I've hit it with a spell.»</p>
   <p>Makri strides to Lisutaris's side, a sword in each hand. I join them. I can sense the power already growing in Lisutaris's hands. I was a failure at sorcery but I can still feel its presence. Lisutaris's eyes turn purple, which means she's summoning up something powerful. I saw her bring down two dragons at once on the battlefield outside the walls of Turai not three months ago, and I'll wager she'll do it again if she has to. As it turns out, she doesn't get the chance. The dragon flies overhead, paying us no attention. Its great white wings carry it high across our bows and swiftly on towards the north.</p>
   <p>«It's heading for Elath,» says Kublinos. «It must be on its way to attack the King.»</p>
   <p>Baron Mabados instructs Kublinos to make all speed to complete the journey. Unlike his soldiers, the Baron showed no sign of fear at the sight of the dragon. Lisutaris remains watchful, as her eyes revert to their normal colour. She turns to Makri. «Did you ever see a white dragon in the East?»</p>
   <p>Makri shakes her head. It's a mystery, and it bodes ill. Dragons can only be controlled by the Orcs. This could be the start of an invasion. The rowers pick up the pace, and we head towards Elath at full speed. Which, on this huge barge, is not that fast. These inland vessels are fine for travelling in comfort, but not much good for getting anywhere in a hurry. Lisutaris frets as she gazes after the dragon. «Is there no way this barge can go any faster?»</p>
   <p>«We could throw Thraxas overboard,» suggests Makri. «Probably double our speed.»</p>
   <p>I glare at Makri, but can't think of a suitable reply, still being distracted by recent events. We crawl slowly up the broad river, scanning the horizon for signs of destruction, expecting to see far-off plumes of smoke as Elath goes up in flames. Rather a waste of time, really, because we're still a long way from Elath. After a while I abandon scanning the horizon and go below deck to drink beer. Makri joins me.</p>
   <p>«This is frustrating,» she says.</p>
   <p>I nod. If the white dragon really is about to attack Elath, we're not going to get there in time to do anything about it.</p>
   <p>«It was only one dragon, though,» I point out. «There are a lot of Sorcerers in Samsarina. Lasat Axe of Gold, and Charius the Wise. They should be able to hold it off.»</p>
   <p>Makri has no confidence in Lasat or Charius, reasoning that any Sorcerer who hates Lisutaris can't be any good. She glances at the small mirror on the cabin wall, and fiddles with her nose ring. As with almost everything about Makri, her pierced nose, barely acceptable in Turai, is cause for outrage in Samsarina. I've seen servants shudder when she passes.</p>
   <p>«Kublinos looked paralysed when the dragon appeared,» I say. «Probably never seen one before. I don't take to him.»</p>
   <p>«Have you noticed how he's playing up to Lisutaris?» asks Makri. «I think he's sweet on her.»</p>
   <p>That's an odd thought. I've known Lisutaris for a long time. I don't remember her ever entering into any sort of romance. Makri is probably imagining it. Her views on romance are usually erratic. She had one fling with an Elf in the Southern Isles and when it didn't end well she moped about it for months.</p>
   <p>«Perhaps he's just trying to make sure he's well-placed with the Head of the Guild,» I suggest. «Sorcerers are always ambitious.»</p>
   <p>«But wouldn't being friendly with Lisutaris put him in a bad position with Lasat? And maybe Baron Mabados as well.» Makri looks thoughtful. «Of course, Baron Mabados has rivals at court. Maybe Mabados and Kublinos want Lisutaris as an ally. Apparently everyone's struggling for influence with the new King.»</p>
   <p>«Since when did you become an expert on affairs at the Samsarinan court?»</p>
   <p>«I just kept my ears open,» replies Makri, rather smugly. «The Barons are always trying to strengthen their positions. That's why this wedding is important.»</p>
   <p>«What wedding?»</p>
   <p>«The wedding everyone's been talking about.»</p>
   <p>«I haven't been paying attention.»</p>
   <p>«Baron Mabados's son is marrying Baron Vosanos's daughter. It'll make a strong alliance. Some of the other Barons aren't pleased at the prospect.»</p>
   <p>I've no wish to think about a power struggle between Barons. I'm still thinking about my old companions in Turai. And my favourite haunts — the bookmaker's shop, the pastry shop, the Avenging Axe. All burned to the ground, or infested with Orcs. I shake my head, and pour myself a beer. Lisutaris does little to cheer me up when she re-appears. She's irritable from lack of thazis, and pessimistic about her reception in Elath.</p>
   <p>«I hate these aristocratic power struggles. You can never do anything without offending someone.» She looks at me rather pointedly. «Something you're already expert in, of course. It's lucky for us the Baroness isn't travelling on this barge.»</p>
   <p>«Would everyone stop going on about the Baroness? So I mistook her for a servant. Could have happened to anyone.»</p>
   <p>«She was wearing a tiara!» exclaims Lisutaris. «When we get to Elath, try not to get drunk when there are important people around.»</p>
   <p>«I'll consider it. Are you planning on watching the tournament?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shrugs. «I doubt I'll have time. I'll need to meet with the other Sorcerers and start planning the war effort.»</p>
   <p>«I've been trying to persuade Makri to enter.»</p>
   <p>«Why?»</p>
   <p>«To gamble on her, of course. She'll be a shoo-in, no one will beat her.»</p>
   <p>«I hear there are a lot of professional swordsmen on their way.»</p>
   <p>I brush this aside. «Makri will destroy them.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris pours herself a goblet of red wine and empties it in one large gulp. Her hand is trembling. You can't smoke a whole thazis bush every day for twenty years and then not notice it when it's gone.</p>
   <p>«Can't you persuade her?» I ask Lisutaris. «You like a good wager yourself.»</p>
   <p>«I do. But Makri is my bodyguard. I need her around. Anyway, none of us have any money for gambling.»</p>
   <p>This makes me pause. I haven't a coin to my name, but with Lisutaris being so rich, I expected she'd be able to come up with something.</p>
   <p>«Don't you have any money invested in Samsarina?»</p>
   <p>She shakes her head. «I lost everything in Turai. Gold, property, antiques, banking interests, all gone. I still have my land I suppose, if we ever get the city back, but here I'm broke. I'm relying on charity from Kublinos.»</p>
   <p>«Well this is very unsatisfactory,» I exclaim. «Here we are approaching the biggest sword-fighting tournament in the West, and we can't put a bet on.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris is no longer listening. She's staring at the floor. Or maybe not staring at anything. I don't think her eyes are focusing properly. She really needs thazis.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Six</strong></p>

   <p>In the light of Makri's suggestion that Kublinos is sweet on Lisutaris, I take a closer look at him. He's about Lisutaris's age, maybe a year or two younger. Though there's little to distinguish him from the general population of dark-haired, medium-built Samsarinans, he does wear quite an elaborate rainbow cloak, and a blue queenstone necklace. The cloak and necklace are a little fancy, but not particularly extravagant by Sorcerers' standards. He's old enough to have fought in the last Orc War, but didn't, being injured at the time. Apparently he was laid up with a broken leg after a horse-riding accident. This doesn't endear him to me. I'm suspicious of anyone who didn't fight the Orcs. I don't know how powerful his sorcery is. Reasonably powerful, I suppose, as he's Harbour Sorcerer of Samsarina's major port. The King wouldn't give that position to anyone weak.</p>
   <p>Makri is leaning on the rail at the side of the barge, staring at some ruins in the distance. An ancient city by the looks of it. She asks me if I know anything about it. I shake my head.</p>
   <p>«Just some dead city.»</p>
   <p>«Aren't you curious?»</p>
   <p>I'm not. Makri, with her weird lust for knowledge, is dissatisfied. Eventually the landscape changes as we approach the southern edge of the great mountain range that splits the northern part of Samsarina. The river narrows, and the main road, visible from our barge, is busier. The miles of unbroken farmland give way to small clusters of houses, hamlets, and the occasional village.</p>
   <p>«What are the baths like?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Large. Warm. Quite pleasant to lie around in. Meant to be good for your health.»</p>
   <p>«Can anyone go in?»</p>
   <p>«Yes, but they keep the best ones for the Barons.»</p>
   <p>«So I'll be in an inferior pool?»</p>
   <p>«Definitely. Along with me. Well, not actually along with me. Men and women bathe separately. But we're not going to get into the Royal Bathing Houses, that's for sure.»</p>
   <p>The river veers east as we approach the mountains. It's possible to sail all the way to Samsara, capital of Samsarina, but to get to Elath we have to disembark and hire horses at a way station, then ride west into the foothills. Baron Mabados rides beside Lisutaris, deep in conversation. I'd like to hear what they're saying but the Baron has made it quite plain he doesn't welcome my company.</p>
   <p>«You'd think he'd have got over it by now,» I say to Makri, riding beside me at the rear of the party.</p>
   <p>«Lucky for you his wife isn't here.»</p>
   <p>That's probably true. Fortunately she's travelling separately. As we near Elath, the road becomes much busier. Tents and stalls have been erected on the outskirts of the town, where armourers, leather-workers and food vendors are plying their trade. We pick our way through carefully. Elath is a town which appears to have grown in a haphazard fashion. There are large, well-built mansions to the north, used as summer homes by the Barons, but the rest of the settlement is a dull collection of low, grey stone and timber buildings. Many of these show signs of cheap construction and poor maintenance. Narrow streets run in apparently random directions, clustered around a town hall which is anything but grand. Even the statue of St Quatinius looks second-rate.</p>
   <p>Makri look around her with distaste. «They don't believe in spending a lot of time on architecture, do they?»</p>
   <p>«Probably not. The place is mostly empty for ten months every year.»</p>
   <p>Kublinos's residence turns out to be one of the largest mansions on the north side of town. While he personally escorts Lisutaris to some luxurious guest suite, a junior servant leads me and Makri to two tiny rooms at the very top of the building. I'm not complaining. I've lived in worse. If I'm not exactly as happy as an Elf in a tree, I'm fairly satisfied. At least I'm warm, with a roof over my head. I shudder at the memory of the boat. I lie down on the small bed and drift off to sleep, thinking about the sword-fighting tournament, and the fine opportunities it affords for gambling.</p>
   <p>When I waken next day, I feel like a bath, which is convenient, as I'm in a town famous for its hot baths. Perhaps I'm setting my sights too low by allowing myself to be shuffled off to the common bathing house. After all, I'm Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky. That ought to worth something in terms of status. I tackle Kublinos about it over breakfast, which we eat in an oak-panelled room with heavy leather chairs and a nicely flickering fire in the grate. It's the sort of decor you'd expect to find among wealthy citizens of Samsarina. Comfortable, but nothing modern; furniture that was passed down to them by their grandparents, and silverware that's even older. Kublinos quickly squashes any hopes of me being admitted to the King's Bathing House.</p>
   <p>«The building is reserved for the aristocracy. Only the King, his Barons and certain members of the court are allowed entry.»</p>
   <p>«Does that include you?»</p>
   <p>«Senior Sorcerers are admitted, yes.»</p>
   <p>«But Lisutaris is going to the Queen's Bathing House. Don't I have some status as her Adviser?»</p>
   <p>Apparently I don't. Makri doesn't appear for breakfast. I find her outside in the grounds, practising with her swords. She never likes to go for long without a weapon in her hands. It makes it all the more ridiculous that's she's refusing to enter the tournament.</p>
   <p>«What are you looking unhappy about?» she asks.</p>
   <p>«This class-ridden society! It's not right that the Barons get all the best hot water and I have to squeeze into some grubby pool with a bunch of farmers.»</p>
   <p>«It was much the same in Turai, wasn't it?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so. But I thought that being Lisutaris's Chief Adviser might have boosted my status.»</p>
   <p>«You said goodbye to your status when you mistook Baroness Demelzos for a serving wench,» says Makri. «Anyway, your status isn't as low as mine.»</p>
   <p>«You should take revenge,» I say.</p>
   <p>«What do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«Show them you're as good as everyone else. Enter the sword-fighting tournament and win it.»</p>
   <p>Makri laughs. «Forget it. I'm not entering some ridiculous tournament. I'm busy. Lisutaris is meeting the Samsarinan Sorcerers and I'm going along as her bodyguard.»</p>
   <p>«She didn't tell me about any meeting. Where are you going?»</p>
   <p>«The Queen's Bathing House.»</p>
   <p>I blink. «What? You get to go to the Queen's Bathing House?»</p>
   <p>«Of course. You can't expect the Head of the Sorcerers Guild to walk around without her bodyguard in wartime. What if an Orcish spy tried to assassinate her?»</p>
   <p>I don't take the news well. The thought of Makri splashing around with the female aristocracy really irritates me. Damn it, you couldn't get more common than Makri. She was born in an Orcish slave pit. I'm a solid citizen with an exemplary record of public service and war-time heroism. They should be welcoming me into the King's Bathing House with open arms. Now in a poor temper, I decide to fortify myself with a beer or two. It's still early in the morning but there's no harm in checking out the local taverns. I stroll past some of the low grey buildings in the centre of town, reflecting that I might have a hard time making a living in Samsarina. I'm not certain that there's enough crime among the mainly-rural population to keep an investigator in employment.</p>
   <p>«Help me!» screams an anguished voice nearby. Maybe I was wrong about the crime. I sprint round the corner where I find an elderly gentlemen having his belongings removed by three armed men. I grab one of the men by his collar and toss him to the ground. His companions round on me.</p>
   <p>«Stay out of this.» One of them brandishes a knife in my direction.</p>
   <p>«Get out of my sight or I'll make you swallow the knife.»</p>
   <p>I place my hand on the hilt of my sword. With no more threat than this, he hurries off, followed by his companions. A very poor class of street thug, if that's all it takes to scare them. That's not to say my actions aren't appreciated by the grey-haired, grey-bearded man currently brushing down his cloak and looking relieved. He bows, thanks me, then introduces himself.</p>
   <p>«Arichdamis. Chief Mathematician at the court of King Gardos.»</p>
   <p>«Thraxas of Turai,» I reply. «Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky.»</p>
   <p>«Really?» My companion looks impressed. «Is Lisutaris here in Elath?»</p>
   <p>I look around for any sign of the thugs. They weren't the bravest robbers I've ever met but they might have friends nearby so there's no point in hanging around. I suggest to Arichdamis that we move on. He tells me he was heading for the baths. Reckoning that it's no bad thing to be on good terms with an important figure at the King's court, I offer to accompany him. It's a sacrifice, as I was hunting for a tavern, but one I'm willing to make. We walk back to the northern outskirts of town, then turn left towards the bathing houses.</p>
   <p>«Why were these thugs attacking you? And do you want to report it to anyone?»</p>
   <p>«Report it to anyone?» Arichdamis doesn't seem to have considered it. Though his eyes are quite alert, he has about him a slightly distracted air, as if he's got part of his mind permanently on some mathematical problem. He might have, I suppose.</p>
   <p>«I take it you live in one of the hillside mansions?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«I do.»</p>
   <p>«If you're heading for the baths, weren't you rather out of your way?»</p>
   <p>«Just taking a walk,» he replies, pleasantly. «Good exercise.»</p>
   <p>He's tall and thin, and stoops slightly. He looks like he could do with some exercise. I should just let it pass. Often there are things you shouldn't talk about. But not talking about things is something I've often found difficult.</p>
   <p>«Well, if you'll take my advice, next time you're out buying an illegal bag of thazis, don't walk down any dark alleyways.»</p>
   <p>This gets his attention. He stops, and stares at me. I take a package from my pocket.</p>
   <p>«You dropped this when you were attacked. I suppose it's what they were after. It would fetch a fair price around here, with it being illegal, and the King so keen to see it stamped out.» Arichdamis looks very alarmed. I hand over the bag. «Don't worry. I'm not about to tell anyone. I'm a Private Investigator by trade. I'm not in the habit of giving away secrets.»</p>
   <p>«It really is vitally important that no one learns of this,» he says.</p>
   <p>«I've never ratted-out a mathematician yet. Which baths are you going to?»</p>
   <p>I'm expecting him to be heading for the King's Bathing House, but apparently the post of Chief Mathematician doesn't carry that much status. He's heading for the common baths, same as me. We stroll up the hill together. I ask him if he's ever encountered Lisutaris. He hasn't, but he's heard favourable reports of her power, and her intelligence.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris would love to meet you,» I tell him.</p>
   <p>«Would she really?»</p>
   <p>«Undoubtedly.»</p>
   <p>Arichdamis looks pleased. As far as I know, Lisutaris doesn't care that much for mathematicians, but she'll certainly be pleased to meet a person with a nice bag of thazis in his pocket.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Seven</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Because of the King's presence, security is tight. Soldiers are stationed on the roads around the town's mansions. They have dark green tunics, polished breastplates and gleaming weapons. On the way back to Kublinos's house I'm halted at a checkpoint, where a Military Sorcerer searches me for hostile spells while the Captain of the Guard verifies my identify.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas of Turai, Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky,» I mutter. Already I'm sick of saying this. It's not like anyone believes I'm giving her advice.</p>
   <p>«Turai?» the Captain sneers. «Didn't hold out for long, did you?»</p>
   <p>I don't bother replying. The Samsarinans may be able to muster a large army, but they don't have a great reputation for warfare, no matter how smart the King's guards look. I make my way to Kublinos's mansion. Servants keep an eye on me as I take the side stairs up to the attic. So far I haven't been invited into Kublinos's state room, or his courtyard shrine, or his main dining room. Nonetheless, after my visit to the mineral baths, I'm feeling more like my old self. I had to do a fair bit of pushing and jostling to get myself a bit of room among the farmers and merchants, but once I'd done that, I had an excellent soak. Arichdamis wasn't a bad companion, for a mathematician. Apparently he designs war machines — siege devices and so on — which explains why he's employed by the King. As an old campaigner myself, I'm sympathetic to anyone who can tell a few good stories about campaigns he's been involved in, which Arichdamis could.</p>
   <p>While soaking in the hot water I did my best to pick up information about the sword-fighting tournament. If Makri won't enter, I can still bet on the other fighters. I anticipate a prosperous betting campaign, if I can just raise some money to get started. I'm musing on where exactly I might raise a stake when there's a sharp knock at my door and Lisutaris enters, looking angry. Ignoring all rules of decorum, she plants herself on the bed and starts complaining.</p>
   <p>«Life is hell,» she begins, and goes on from there. The Sorceress spent the morning in a meeting with King Gardos, his Barons and his Sorcerers. By her account, her reception was frosty. «Lasat looked at me like I was something washed up on the beach. Which I was, I suppose. He'd heard I was missing — some Sorcerer got a message to him, I don't know who — and he'd already started to take control of the Guild. Charius the Wise was there and he hates me just as much as Lasat. Damn these Samsarinan Sorcerers. The Barons are no better. The story has got around that an Orcish Sorcerer sneaked into Turai without me detecting her, and now people are whispering I'm not up to the job.»</p>
   <p>«What about the King? Is he against you?»</p>
   <p>«Gardos is young. He's only been on the throne for a few months. I don't think he's really established himself yet. I can't see him standing up to the Barons and Sorcerers on my behalf. Besides, he's not what you'd call intelligent.»</p>
   <p>«Isn't he?»</p>
   <p>«Of course not. If he had any sense he wouldn't be carrying on with this ludicrous anti-thazis policy.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris drums her fingers on the side of the bed. «Damn this place,» she mutters. She glares at me crossly. «Weren't you meant to be finding some thazis? You're my Chief Adviser. Is it really beyond you to»</p>
   <p>«I found some.»</p>
   <p>«What? Where is it? Give me it!»</p>
   <p>I admit I don't actually have any on me. «But I do know a user, and I'm certain he'd share with you. A man called Arichdamis. Mathematician to the King.»</p>
   <p>«Arichdamis? He's here?»</p>
   <p>«You've heard of him?»</p>
   <p>«Of course,» says Lisutaris. «He's one of the most famous scientists and mathematicians in the world. Are you sure he has thazis?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. And he was keen to meet you.»</p>
   <p>«Then let's go.» Lisutaris stands up.</p>
   <p>«Aren't you meant to be dining with Kublinos?»</p>
   <p>«Kublinos can wait.»</p>
   <p>Nothing will satisfy Lisutaris but that we set off right away. She summons a servant to take a note to Makri — currently practising with her weapons outside — telling her to meet us there, and we depart. Outside the sky is still grey but the temperature has risen a degree or two. Further east, the snows will soon be melting. The storms in the great ocean to the south will be calming down. It's almost the season for war.</p>
   <p>«Makri will want to meet Arichdamis,» says Lisutaris. «He's written quite a few important scientific treatises.»</p>
   <p>«No doubt she's read them all,» I respond, gloomily. «And will bore me to death with a long lecture abut some interminably dull subject no one in their right mind would care about.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris carries herself regally as we pass by the guards and soldiers outside. If she's feeling browbeaten by the local Barons, no one could tell from the way she freezes out a Sorcerer who tries to check me for spells. «The Chief Adviser to the Head of the Sorcerers Guild does not require inspection, thank you.»</p>
   <p>We sweep past. I thank Lisutaris. «It's time I got a bit of respect around here. Since I arrived in Samsarina it's been one insult after another.»</p>
   <p>«For instance?»</p>
   <p>«For instance it's outrageous that Makri gets to go to the Queen's Bathing House while I have to go to the common place. I almost drowned under the weight of farmers and blacksmiths.»</p>
   <p>«I'm sorry, Thraxas. They're willing to stretch a point for my bodyguard, but not my Adviser. Was it really so bad?»</p>
   <p>«No, not really. Crowded, though. What's the Queen's Bathing House like?»</p>
   <p>«Extremely elegant. Marble floors, steam rooms, masseurs, that sort of thing.»</p>
   <p>«How did the massed ranks of Baronesses react to the not-very-aristocratic-Makri?»</p>
   <p>My question makes Lisutaris frown.</p>
   <p>«What's wrong? Did she commit some outrage?»</p>
   <p>«No, she behaved quite properly. It's just… I don't suppose you've ever seen Makri naked?»</p>
   <p>«I have.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks at me with surprise. «You have?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. When she strolled into my room without bothering to get dressed. Until you've lived in the same tavern as Makri, you have no idea how uncivilised she is.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris continues to look at me rather dubiously for a few moments, then carries on. «Well, if you've seen her naked, you'll know what I'm talking about. She has a body like… like…» Lisutaris struggles to find a comparison. «Like a female athlete would be, if there were such a thing. Her stomach is completely flat. You can see the outline of her muscles, which I've never seen on a woman before. She doesn't appear to have a single ounce of spare fat anywhere. Apart from her breasts, oddly enough, which seem rather generously-sized. You've no idea the sensation this caused at the bathing house.»</p>
   <p>«Really?»</p>
   <p>«When she walked out of the changing rooms there was a sort of collective gasp. The Baroness beside me probably hadn't thought about her own body for the past twenty years but I swear she was sucking her tummy in when Makri strolled past. There was nothing but rich women looking sick with envy.»</p>
   <p>It's not something I'd anticipated, but I can understand it. The aristocracy in Samsarina are no doubt just as vain and frivolous as they were in Turai.</p>
   <p>«But what about the pointy ears?» I ask. «I'm sure they weren't jealous of her Orcish blood.»</p>
   <p>«Well no. But even so, she had quite a sensational effect. Makri, while swimming, displays remarkable muscular development. I caught sight of one young princess flexing her arm to see if there was any sign of a bicep. Which sadly, there wasn't.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks rather thoughtfully down at her own body. «How does she do it?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. She doesn't eat much, and she's always practising with weapons. But I've always thought she was too skinny.»</p>
   <p>«Really Thraxas? Only moments ago you were revelling in seeing her naked.»</p>
   <p>«I was not revelling. Merely reporting the facts.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris look irritated. «I need to win these Barons' support against Lasat. I'm not going to be popular if their wives are all miserable because Makri's made them feel flabby.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe they'd be pleased if their wives start taking better care of themselves?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shakes her head. «I got the impression the King wasn't very impressed with me having Makri as my bodyguard. Probably doesn't believe she can even fight.»</p>
   <p>«You should encourage her to enter the tournament. If your bodyguard won that, it would be a real boost to your status.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris doesn't dismiss the idea out of hand. By now we've reached the northern edge of town where the mansions are laid out in a haphazard manner. Presumably each Baron bought the best piece of land they could find, and started building. The streets between their mansions are narrower than might be expected, and there's an unusually high concentration of nobility in the area. At times there seems to be a Baron round every corner, and manners are probably more relaxed than they would be at court.</p>
   <p>I wonder if Lisutaris fully appreciates the risk she's taking in visiting Arichdamis. «You know how the King feels about thazis. If you're caught using it, he'll be down on you like a bad spell.»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress shrugs. «I'll risk it. Makri was right. It's a flaw in my character and there's nothing to be done about it. Are you sure we're going the right way?»</p>
   <p>«I think so.»</p>
   <p>«I don't want to ruin into Baron Mabados or Lasat again.»</p>
   <p>«Relax,» I say. «We're nowhere near the Baron's house.»</p>
   <p>I lead us round the corner. There, looking comfortable in his own front yard, is Baron Mabados. Lasat Axe of Gold is next to him. Lisutaris shoots me an angry glance and swears under her breath.</p>
   <p>«Baron Mabados,» she exclaims. «What a pleasant surprise to meet you again. And Lasat as well. It seems like only minutes since we parted.»</p>
   <p>If it sounds a little forced, it's a good deal more polite than Lasat Axe of Gold, manages. He barely acknowledges Lisutaris's greeting, though the Baron does manage to make the formal bow due to a woman of Lisutaris's status. We stand there awkwardly for a few moments. I feel sorry for Lisutaris, and her acute lack of thazis. I notice a few beads of perspiration on her brow. The front portal of the mansion opens and some men troop out. Another Baron, I'd guess, and several men with swords, including Basinos. sword-fighting champion of the southern armies.</p>
   <p>«My champion, and entrant for the sword-fighting tournament,» says Baron Mabados.</p>
   <p>«And mine,» chimes in Lasat, indicating the other swordsman. «Elupus of Simnia.»</p>
   <p>Elupus makes a small bow. He's not especially tall for a sword-fighter, but he's powerfully built, and carries himself confidently, as befits a man who's won tournaments all over the West. It's quite a surprise to learn that he's being sponsored by Lasat. The Sorcerer really must want to boost his own status.</p>
   <p>«Will you be entering your bodyguard in the tournament?» Baron Mabados asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«The thin woman?» says Lasat. «I doubt she'd want to trade blows with Elupus or Basinos.»</p>
   <p>«My bodyguard is not keen on tournaments,» says Lisutaris, evenly.</p>
   <p>«Quite wise,» replies Lasat. One wouldn't want to see her hurt.</p>
   <p>The other Baron in attendance, who's name I don't know, sniggers at this. Lisutaris is discomfited. I'm angry.</p>
   <p>«You can count yourselves lucky Makri isn't entering the tournament,» I say. «Or she'd show you who was number one chariot with a sword.»</p>
   <p>My outburst only provokes more mirth.</p>
   <p>«Is it really wise,» says Lasat to Mabados. «In these dangerous times, to engage the services of such an ineffectual bodyguard?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris is about to respond but she doesn't get the chance.</p>
   <p>«I am entering the contest,» comes a voice from behind us. Makri has arrived.</p>
   <p>«You are?» I say.</p>
   <p>«Of course,» replies Makri, quite calmly, as if she meant to do so all along. «And when I win, people will see which Sorcerer has the best judgement in bodyguards.»</p>
   <p>«Well put Makri,» says Lisutaris, «Now we really must be off. Good day, Baron, Lasat.»</p>
   <p>We walk on.</p>
   <p>«Thanks for doing that,» says Lisutaris. «I know you didn't want to enter the tournament.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not letting them insult us like that,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Lasat still thinks he can force me out of the Sorcerers Guild, and take over,» says Lisutaris. She pauses. I notice her fists are clenched. «Are we far from Arichdamis house? If I don't get some thazis soon I'm going to explode in a fireball which may destroy the entire town. Thraxas? Are you listening?»</p>
   <p>«Of course he isn't listening,» says Makri. «He's dreaming about his betting campaign now I've entered the tournament.»</p>
   <p>She's right. I can sense prosperous times ahead. Makri is going to sweep all opposition before her. If I can just raise a stake, I'll show these Samsarinan bookmakers a thing or two.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Eight</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>As we approach Arichdamis's house, Baroness Demelzos passes by on the other side of the road, in the company of two other well dressed women, both Baronesses, according to Lisutaris. Demelzos notices us, but barely acknowledges our presence.</p>
   <p>«That was quite rude,» says Lisutaris. «Only a few hours ago we were sharing the same mineral bath.»</p>
   <p>«But Thraxas wasn't there then,» Makri points out.</p>
   <p>«True. You can't expect her to stop for a chat when Thraxas is around. There's no knowing what he might come out with.»</p>
   <p>I ignore their mockery. It's the first time I've seen the Baroness since our unfortunate encounter in Orosis. Now I'm sober, Demelzos reminds me of someone, but I can't remember who.</p>
   <p>Arichdamis's dwelling is far more modest than those of the Barons.</p>
   <p>«I thought he'd have a bigger house,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Probably he just sits and thinks most of the time.» I suggest. «No real need for a lot of space.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks at me with contempt. «You have no idea of the extensive scientific interests of Arichdamis, have you?»</p>
   <p>«No. And if you're about to tell me about them, don't bother.»</p>
   <p>By this time Lisutaris is pulling on the chain by the door, ringing a bell inside. An elderly servant appears.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, here to see Arichdamis on important business.» She sweeps past without waiting for an answer. The servant, displeased at this breach of etiquette, attempts to block her way. I hold him back, not wanting to see him reduced to a pile of ashes, which is quite likely if he gets in-between Lisutaris and a bag of thazis. The Sorceress disappears rapidly through the door at the end of the hallway. Makri hurries after her, and the servant follows them, leaving me on my own. The hallway is slightly seedy. Not decrepit, just neglected. Arichdamis obviously isn't a stickler for cleanliness and I doubt his servants do more than they have to. I glance into his private temple, in the middle of the house. It's bare, with only a small statue of Saint Quatinius. From the dust on the floor, I'd say that Arichdamis doesn't visit much. The next room is crammed full of books and papers. The desk is cluttered with drawings, plans for strange machines. As I stroll through the house I see nothing that's well-upholstered, colourful or cheerful. Just some functional furniture and a lot of books and papers. It's like a gigantic version of Makri's room back in Turai.</p>
   <p>I find Lisutaris sitting on the grass behind the house, smoking thazis. It says something for her powers of persuasion that she managed to obtain the drug from the mathematician so quickly. Presumably, he wouldn't have been that keen to hand it over, but here she is, digging into his supply already. Arichdamis is talking quite intently to Makri.</p>
   <p>«Yes, I've calculated pi to a value between three and one-seventh, and three and ten seventy-firsts.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks excited. «Really? That's so accurate! Can I see your calculations?»</p>
   <p>I leave them to it, and take a seat on the grass beside Lisutaris. I hold out my hand. She hands over a small fragment of thazis.</p>
   <p>«Nice grounds,» I mutter. They are extensive, given that the house itself isn't large. They stretch a long way back, ending in a wooded slope that rises into the mountains. Lisutaris grunts, a sound I interpret to mean she doesn't care if the grounds are nice or not. I roll myself a small thazis stick and light it from hers. It's peaceful here in the garden; probably the first time we've been at peace since our city fell. We sit in silence for a long time. A few rays of sunlight penetrate the clouds overhead. It will soon be spring.</p>
   <p>«Plants will start growing,» I mutter.</p>
   <p>«Yes,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«And we'll be marching off to war.»</p>
   <p>«True.»</p>
   <p>«I wonder how many times I've marched off to war?»</p>
   <p>«There's a small dragon walking down the hill,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>This seems like an odd reply. «Eh… I'm not much good on symbolism. Does the small dragon represent us or the Orcs?»</p>
   <p>«It doesn't represent anything. There really is a small dragon walking down the hill.»</p>
   <p>I glance round, and immediately leap to my feet in alarm. As accurately reported by Lisutaris, a small dragon is ambling down the hill towards us. It's white, about the size of a very large dog, and it has a lot of teeth and talons. It makes straight for Makri and Arichdamis. I shout a warning. Makri catches sight of it and flies into action. She draws her twin swords, sinks into her fighting crouch and gets ready to defend herself. It takes me only a few seconds to reach her and I draw my own sword, ready to fight off the beast.</p>
   <p>The dragon draws near to Makri, rolls on its back, then sort of wriggles towards her and starts licking her ankles. Makri looks down at it suspiciously.</p>
   <p>«What is this vile beast?» she demands. «And why is it licking my ankles?»</p>
   <p>«It's the King's baby ice dragon,» says Arichdamis. «I'm looking after it.»</p>
   <p>«Why?»</p>
   <p>«It's a scientific project. They've hardly ever been raised in captivity.»</p>
   <p>«All right. But what about the ankle licking?»</p>
   <p>«Maybe it thinks you're its mother?» I suggest.</p>
   <p>Makri scowls. «I think I'm going to stab it.» She raises her sword.</p>
   <p>«No!» yells Arichdamis. «This dragon is very important to the King! It mustn't be harmed!»</p>
   <p>Although Arichdamis is keen to protect the young dragon, it doesn't actually seem that keen on him. When he puts his hands on its tail, attempting to drag it away from Makri, it turns its head towards him and growls, quite ferociously, before once more returning to Makri's ankles.</p>
   <p>Arichdamis looks puzzled. «I've never seen this behaviour before. Tell me, Makri, have you experience in looking after dragons?»</p>
   <p>«Certainly not.»</p>
   <p>«It's odd. He certainly seems to take to you.»</p>
   <p>Makri is not looking pleased, and keeps trying to back away from the beast, which, however, doesn't want to let her go.</p>
   <p>«Could you try this?» asks Arichdamis. He reaches down and attempts to stroke the dragon's head. The dragon lets out a fierce roar and bares its teeth. Makri sheathes one of her swords and reaches down. She gives the baby dragon a brief pat on the head. The dragon lets out a noise which, while not exactly pleasant, might be described as purring. Arichdamis looks delighted.</p>
   <p>«This is splendid! You've no idea the trouble we've had keeping him happy. It's been almost impossible to get him to eat. I've been worried he might just die, and I can't tell you how much trouble that would cause me. But now you've come along, everything will be different.»</p>
   <p>Not liking the way this conversation is going, Makri narrows her eyes. «What do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«You must help me care for the dragon. You'll have him eating again in no time.»</p>
   <p>«Completely out of the question,» says Makri, raising her voice. «I've got a sword-fighting competition to win, a Sorcerer to protect and a city to take back from the Orcs. I can't waste time looking after baby dragons.» Maki glares down at the beast. «I don't even like baby dragons.»</p>
   <p>«But you have to help,» pleads our host. «I've been at my wit's end. I'm sure the King will be most grateful.»</p>
   <p>At that moment a procession marches round the side of the house, made up of eighteen soldiers, three Sorcerers, three Barons, several officials and King Gardos. It's the first time I've seen the young King, but he's easily recognisable from the discreet gold circlet on his head. Arichdamis bows low. He doesn't seem surprised at their arrival, so I presume it's not the first time the King has marched into his grounds without knocking at the door. The King pays no attention to Arichdamis, choosing instead to glare at Makri.</p>
   <p>«What is happening here?» he demands. «What are you doing with my dragon?»</p>
   <p>«Your majesty,» exclaims Arichdamis, surfacing from his bow. «A remarkable occurrence. This woman has the power to soothe and comfort the dragon.»</p>
   <p>The King's scowl slowly fades at the sight of the small dragon playing at Makri's feet. «Astonishing!» he says. «Who is this young woman?»</p>
   <p>«Makri, your majesty. Bodyguard to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky.»</p>
   <p>The King's brow furrows slightly as he further examines Makri. «Is she an Orc?»</p>
   <p>«Partially, I believe,» says Arichdamis. «But she is very good with the dragon.»</p>
   <p>«We shall see,» says the King. «Bring forth the meat.»</p>
   <p>At the King's command a member of the royal household removes the lid of a silver platter to reveal a joint of raw meat.</p>
   <p>«Feed the dragon,» commands the King.</p>
   <p>The attendant edges forward nervously. He holds out the meat, trying to keep as much distance as possible between himself and the creature. As soon as he comes near, the small white dragon starts snarling at him. He retreats rapidly. The King looks at Makri.</p>
   <p>«Partially Orcish woman. Try feeding my dragon.»</p>
   <p>I'm concerned that Makri, being uncivilised, unused to monarchs, and never pleased to be described as an Orc, might refuse to co-operate. Fortunately she does seem to grasp that you can't go around being rude to a King when you're a refugee in his country. She shrugs, picks up the meat and thrusts it at the dragon.</p>
   <p>«Eat this you beast.»</p>
   <p>The dragon leaps for the venison and gobbles it down immediately. There's a collective gasp from the procession at the sight of the dragon feasting happily. When it's finished the meat, it again snuggles down around Makri's ankles. King Gardos turns to one of his counsellors, the most important one, I'd guess, from the gilded insignia on his cloak.</p>
   <p>«This woman must look after my dragon. Organise matters so that she has whatever she needs.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Nine</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>A few hours later, back in Kublinos's mansion to pack up our meagre belongings, Makri is complaining. «I don't want to look after a dragon.»</p>
   <p>«Look on the bright side,» I say. «We all get to move into Arichdamis's house which is a lot better than this servant's attic. You've got plenty of space to practise your sword fighting and Lisutaris can smoke thazis till her heart's content.»</p>
   <p>«It's certainly fortuitous,» agrees Lisutaris. «As long as you can keep that dragon happy I'll be in good standing with the King. And there's the tournament too. If you can win that it'll really boost my status.»</p>
   <p>Makri frowns. «How is that everything seems to be resting on my shoulders?»</p>
   <p>«Just the way things work out,» says Lisutaris, amiably.</p>
   <p>Makri continues to grumble. I point out that it won't be that hard looking after the dragon. «Just tickle it behind the ear and throw some meat at it. It can't be that hard.»</p>
   <p>«He tried to bit your hand off.»</p>
   <p>It's true. The creature did not take kindly to being stroked by me. I was fortunate to escape with my fingers still attached. It doesn't seem to like anyone except Makri. It's a strange phenomenon, though one I have encountered before. When we visited the Fairy Glade together, the centaurs, fairies, and assorted other magical creatures all seemed keen on Makri.</p>
   <p>«What if its mother comes back?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>We fall silent, thinking about the huge white dragon that flew overhead while we were sailing up the river. While we don't have any proof that it was our dragon's mother, it seems likely. According to Arichdamis, the baby dragon was found, as an egg, by a scientific expedition to the furthest reaches of the mountains in north. They handed it over to the King, who then gave it to Arichdamis with the instructions to rear it. Possibly he has some scheme to be the first western monarch to control dragons. It seems like a foolish endeavour to me. The King of Turai once had a dragon in his zoo, and that ended very badly.</p>
   <p>«What's the idea of telling the King you're my manager?» continues Makri.</p>
   <p>«I had to say that. I wasn't going to be left behind in this attic. Anyway, it's true enough. If you're entering the tournament you'll need someone to look after your affairs. I can do that. Which brings us to our first problem; money. There's the entrance fee, and you'll need weapons and armour, which aren't cheap. Lisutaris, can you help?»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress shakes her head. She's still living on charity from Kublinos. «I can't ask him for any more.»</p>
   <p>«Why not?»</p>
   <p>«It would be demeaning.»</p>
   <p>«So?»</p>
   <p>«It's hardly going to increase my status if people know I've been begging money to buy armour for my bodyguard, is it?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose not. Well, I'll have to think of something. There's the gambling to consider as well.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris nods sagely. «Of course, we must bet on Makri. If only I could earn something. Would it affect my status if I took on some private work?»</p>
   <p>«Yes it would,» declares Makri. «You're Head of the Guild. You can't be casting horoscopes to raise cash. Thraxas, if you're betting on me I want a fair share of the winnings. And none of your outlandish, risk-filled gambles either. I want a solid, practical betting strategy.»</p>
   <p>I smile. As I said, Makri is nowhere near as averse to gambling as she pretends. «Have I ever let you down?»</p>
   <p>«Almost continually.»</p>
   <p>It strikes me that I could probably earn money in Elath. «There has to be some crime going on here, with Barons, sword-fighters and assorted gamblers in town. Perhaps I could find something that needs investigating.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris stands up and cranes her neck to examine herself in the tiny mirror on the attic wall. «There's something wrong with this dress,» she mutters. «The clasp at the neck isn't fastening properly.»</p>
   <p>Makri stands behind Lisutaris and attempts to rectify the situation, but quickly becomes frustrated. «I can't close it. How does it work?'»</p>
   <p>I raise my eyes to heaven. If you're having problems in the female costuming department, Makri is never going to be any help.</p>
   <p>«Step aside and let a civilised Turanian look at it,» I say, and brush Makri aside. «The clasp is jammed.»</p>
   <p>«We know that already,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Let me try again,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«What with? Your axe? Not every problem can be solved by violence.»</p>
   <p>I take hold of the clasp and give it a tug. Nothing happens. I pull it harder. The clasp rips right out of the dress which then flops down around Lisutaris's waist. Makri bursts out laughing. At this moment Kublinos walks into the room. Seeing Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, with her dress around her waist, he looks surprised.</p>
   <p>«What is… eh…?»</p>
   <p>«Come Makri, let's go to my room and see if we can repair the damage,» says Lisutaris. They disappear. Kublinos looks at me very suspiciously.</p>
   <p>«What was that all about?»</p>
   <p>«Just a little clothing problem.»</p>
   <p>«Was it you who ripped Lisutaris's dress?»</p>
   <p>«Accidentally.»</p>
   <p>His eyes narrow. «I have to say, Thraxas, your attempts to win the favour of Lisutaris are quite inappropriate. Apart from your unsuitable character, there's the difference in class to be considered.»</p>
   <p>Before I can protest, he rushes on.</p>
   <p>«Just because you rescued Lisutaris — or claim to have — doesn't give you the right to inflict yourself on her. I've seen the way you operate and I don't like it at all.»</p>
   <p>Faced with an angry and apparently insane Sorcerer, I'm starting to think it's a good thing I'm wearing a powerful spell protection necklace. Kublinos's idea that I'm somehow trying attach myself to Lisutaris is so ridiculous I barely know how to answer.</p>
   <p>«You're forever whispering in her ear, trying to worm your way into her affections. No doubt you persuaded her to move with you to Arichdamis's house so you can carry on your deceitful campaign unhindered.» He leans towards me. «I'm warning you Thraxas, I've got plenty of spells just waiting to be used on any shameless adventurer with his eyes on Lisutaris's fortune.»</p>
   <p>There's no telling how this might end, but we're interrupted by the arrival of a servant. Apparently I'm wanted downstairs. I depart immediately, grateful for the interruption. There I find another servant, a young man wearing a fancy tunic with an unnecessary amount of gold braid.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas? Baroness Demelzos wishes to see you.»</p>
   <p>This takes me by surprise. I'd have guessed she'd happily live out her life without ever seeing me again. I shrug, and follow the servant into the narrow streets that separate the Baronial dwellings of Elath. Every few steps we pass by some richly attired group of aristocrats. Rarely can so many lords and Barons have been crammed together in such a small space. The servant stops in front of a smart carriage, with two horses in front and dark curtains on the windows. The servant checks the street to make sure no one's looking at us.</p>
   <p>«In there,» he says.</p>
   <p>The door opens. I step inside. It's a plush carriage, upholstered in purple with silver trimmings. Inside is Baroness Demelzos.</p>
   <p>«Please shut the door.»</p>
   <p>I do as she says, then take a seat opposite her. We sit in silence for a few minutes.</p>
   <p>«Nice carriage,» I say, eventually.</p>
   <p>She looks irritated. «You have no manners, have you?»</p>
   <p>«Not many.»</p>
   <p>«You never did have.»</p>
   <p>I raise an eyebrow. «Have we met?»</p>
   <p>«You mean before you mistook me for a serving wench in Orosis?»</p>
   <p>Baroness Demelzos looks more irritated. I'm starting to wonder if she just got me here so she could have someone to be irritated at.</p>
   <p>«Why were you so appallingly rude? And drunk?»</p>
   <p>«I'd just come off an eight-day stint in a boat with no sails. Before that I'd been chased out my city by Orcs. I felt I deserved a beer or two.»</p>
   <p>«You always did drink too much. Even as a young man you had a problem.» Baroness Demelzos leans over slightly and fixes me with an unfriendly stare. «I never expected you to treasure my memory, Thraxas, but I didn't think you'd completely forget me.»</p>
   <p>I look at her blankly. «Who are you?»</p>
   <p>«I'm Demmy, the barmaid you had an affair with after you won the tournament.» She sits back heavily. «I expect you forgot about me within a week.»</p>
   <p>This is all quite a shock. I did have a brief liaison with a barmaid while I was in Samsarina. That was more than twenty years ago. «You're Demmy? Well dammit, how was I meant to recognise you?»</p>
   <p>«I haven't changed that much,» said Demelzos. She eyes my waistline. «Unlike you.»</p>
   <p>«But you were a barmaid. I wasn't expecting you to become a Baroness. How did that happen?»</p>
   <p>«My father left his job in the mine and went up north to prospect for queenstone. He made the richest strike anyone ever saw. Two years after you left Samsarina I was the wealthiest young woman in the country. Soon after that I was a member of aristocracy. The Barons are an exclusive class, but a young woman with enough money is tempting for anyone.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness is wearing a queenstone necklace, and even inside the carriage, with the curtains drawn, the blue stones sparkle. It's a very precious material, only found in Samsarina as far as I know.</p>
   <p>«So what's it like being married to Baron Mabados?»</p>
   <p>«Better than being a barmaid. How did life treat you?»</p>
   <p>«Twenty years soldiering, then I ended up living in a tavern in the bad part of town.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos was an attractive barmaid, as I recall, and she hasn't lost much in the way of looks. Her long brown hair hangs freely over her shoulders, in the style of the local noblewomen, with two slender braids looping round to meet at the nape of her neck where they're joined by a silver clasp. Though the weather is becoming milder, she hasn't abandoned her fur cape, which is luxurious, even by the normal standards of fur capes. Her shoes, while neither as extravagant nor as high-heeled as those worn by the fashionable women of Turai, are stitched with gold thread. I'd say she hasn't done too badly for herself.</p>
   <p>«I'm guessing you'd didn't ask me here to discuss old times,» I say.</p>
   <p>«I didn't. Though if I did, I'd have something to say about the way you left without saying goodbye.»</p>
   <p>«I had to get back to my regiment. I was absent without leave.»</p>
   <p>«You could have said goodbye.»</p>
   <p>«Sorry. As a young man, I may have been lacking in manners.»</p>
   <p>«Have they improved?»</p>
   <p>«Not really.»</p>
   <p>I'm feeling discomfited by the encounter. It's hard to know the right tone to take with a Baroness you knew as a barmaid.</p>
   <p>«I'm told you call yourself an investigator,» she says. «What do you do exactly?»</p>
   <p>«I find out things for people.»</p>
   <p>«What sort of people?»</p>
   <p>«All sorts. Poor people who can't afford a good lawyer. Rich people who don't want a good lawyer knowing the sort of trouble they're in. People who've got on the wrong side of someone powerful.» I pause, waiting for her to speak. She remains silent. «Do you fall into one of these categories?»</p>
   <p>«How do you find things out? Sorcery?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know enough sorcery to tell what day it is.»</p>
   <p>«Didn't you go to the Sorcerer's college? I remember you used to talk about it.»</p>
   <p>«It never worked out.»</p>
   <p>«So how do you find things out?»</p>
   <p>«Mostly by trudging around asking questions that other people can't be bothered to ask. It would save time if you told me what the problem is.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos muses for a while longer. It's a comfortable carriage. I don't mind waiting. It gives me some time to digest the fact that the young barmaid I had a brief affair with went on to become a Baroness. Maybe I should have stuck around till she became rich.</p>
   <p>«My daughter thinks someone is trying to kill her,» she says, eventually.</p>
   <p>«Are they?»</p>
   <p>«I don't think so. Why would anyone try to kill a Baron's daughter?»</p>
   <p>«Baron have enemies, I suppose.»</p>
   <p>«Probably,» agrees the Baroness. «But I can't see any reason they'd trouble my daughter Merlione. But ever since the accident she's been scared.»</p>
   <p>I lean forward. «Accident?»</p>
   <p>«Her friend Alceten was killed by a runaway carriage. Merlione saw it happen. She'd gone to meet her at the Royal Record House. Alceten's father was the Record Keeper. She came out the building, waved to my daughter, and then she was struck down by a carriage. It was a terrible accident. Alceten's family is distraught. But that's all it was, an accident.»</p>
   <p>«Merlione doesn't think so?»</p>
   <p>Baroness Demelzos shakes her head. «She's convinced it was deliberate. Worse, she thinks she's next.»</p>
   <p>«Were there any other witnesses?»</p>
   <p>«I think so. Daringos, the King's Chief Steward, did carry out an enquiry. If there'd been any hint of foul play I'm sure it would have been discovered.» The Baroness sighs. Briefly, she looks older. «My daughter just won't accept it was an accident. She's a quiet girl…» The Baroness's voice tails off.</p>
   <p>«You mean quiet and sensible, or quiet and neurotic?»</p>
   <p>«My daughter is not neurotic.»</p>
   <p>«So she's sensible?»</p>
   <p>«I'd say so. And she's good-natured, and intelligent. I love her dearly. I'm sure she's in no danger but I hate to see her frightened. Do you think you could talk to her? Just in case there's anything in it?»</p>
   <p>I mull things over for a little while. Outside I can hear the civilised tread of passing Barons, and the voices of their children.</p>
   <p>«Is it difficult being married to a Baron? After growing up poor?»</p>
   <p>«Isn't that rather an impertinent question?»</p>
   <p>«Probably.»</p>
   <p>«My marriage to Mabados has been generally successful.»</p>
   <p><emphasis>Generally successful</emphasis> doesn't sound like the warmest description of a marriage I've ever heard. Sensing my doubts, Demelzos takes the opportunity to ask if I ever managed to stay in one place long enough to get married.</p>
   <p>«I did.»</p>
   <p>«And?»</p>
   <p>«Complete disaster.»</p>
   <p>«Any children?»</p>
   <p>«No. No property either.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness smiles. It makes her look younger, more like the barmaid I remember.</p>
   <p>«What does the Baron say about all this?»</p>
   <p>«He doesn't believe any of it. I can't really blame him, it all sounds so unlikely. It's putting a strain on my family. My daughter's refusing to leave the house. She wouldn't come with us to Orosis. My husband was furious.»</p>
   <p>«It must be awkward, with the wedding coming up.»</p>
   <p>«It is. If she's not at her brother's wedding, people will talk. Baronesses can be very vindictive with their gossip. Do you think you can help?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. I can.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness fishes around in her bag. «How much do you charge?»</p>
   <p>«Thirty gurans a day. But you don't have to pay me.»</p>
   <p>«That's gallant. I don't remember you being gallant. Weren't there some questions asked about your tactics in the tournament?»</p>
   <p>I grin. «One or two. But I still won. You don't need to pay me.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos smiles. She's pleased I'm not charging her.</p>
   <p>«But you could lend me some money.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos looks startled, and then laughs. «That's more like the man I remember. What do you need a loan for?»</p>
   <p>I explain that I need money for Makri to enter the tournament.</p>
   <p>«The Orc woman?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. Though she wouldn't like you calling her that.»</p>
   <p>«Can she fight?»</p>
   <p>«Champion of the Orcish gladiator pits.»</p>
   <p>«But she's just a skinny young girl.»</p>
   <p>«True. But she's part Orc, part Human, and part Elf. That's meant to be impossible, but she managed it somehow. The mixed blood's done something strange to her. It makes her move faster than anyone else. She likes fighting too, which makes a difference. But we need money for armour and weapons.»</p>
   <p>«And then there's your betting to consider, I imagine?»</p>
   <p>«You don't seem to have forgotten much about me. Yes, I may place a few bets.»</p>
   <p>«So which one of the women is yours?» she asks, while counting out coins.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«The Orc girl or the Sorceress? Who's you lover?»</p>
   <p>«Neither. I gave up on women when my marriage fell apart.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos plainly doesn't believe me, but lets it pass.</p>
   <p>«How much do you need?»</p>
   <p>«For Makri? About two hundred.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos hands me three hundred gurans. Twelve heavy gold coins.</p>
   <p>«That should keep you going. Make sure the Baron never hears about it.»</p>

   <title>
    <p><strong>Chapter Ten</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Makri stares at me suspiciously. «I can't believe you had an affair with a Baroness.»</p>
   <p>«She wasn't a Baroness at the time. She was a barmaid.»</p>
   <p>«I can't believe you had an affair with a barmaid.»</p>
   <p>«What's so strange about it? I'd just won the sword-fighting tournament. There were barmaids all over Samsarina keen to have an affair with me. Just because I don't boast about these things doesn't mean I wasn't a man for the ladies in my younger days.»</p>
   <p>Makri shakes her head. «Are you sure you're not imagining it?»</p>
   <p>I tap the purse I'm carrying. «You should be grateful the Baroness liked me so much. Otherwise we wouldn't have money for your armour.» I shake the purse, making the coins jangle. «I expect she's remembered me very fondly over the years.»</p>
   <p>«You're loving this, aren't you?» says Makri, who, for some reason, seems unnecessarily scathing about the whole thing.</p>
   <p>«I suppose it does say something about the vigorous love-making of the youthful Thraxas that she still remembers me so kindly. But I'm not bragging.»</p>
   <p>«If Baron Mabados ever finds out he'll throw you back in the ocean.» Makri doesn't sound too displeased at the prospect.</p>
   <p>We're walking through Elath, on our way to buy armour and weapons. Makri's preferred method of combat is to use two swords, but tournament rules stipulate that each fighter must enter the arena carrying a sword and a shield.</p>
   <p>«A blunted sword,» mutters Makri. «What use is that?»</p>
   <p>Weapons have to have the edge taken off before they can be used. Makri keeps grumbling about it. We walk eastwards through the town till we reach the outskirts, where tents have been set up selling all sorts of goods. Makri becomes more interested as we approach. She does like weapons, and can't help but be interested in the rows of swords, shields, helmets and so on. We're studying a display of daggers when someone claps me heartily on the back.</p>
   <p>«Saxarth? Is that you? You old dog!»</p>
   <p>I turn round to find myself confronted by a man a few inches shorter than me, grey haired, but wiry and vigorous.</p>
   <p>«Combius?»</p>
   <p>«Saxarth!» He claps me on the shoulder again. «Good to see you!»</p>
   <p>«Saxarth?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«It's the name I used when I won the tournament. I was absent without leave from the army at the time. Had to disguise my identity. Makri, this is Combius of Juval. Champion the year before me, and as good a fighter as I've met.»</p>
   <p>«I'd have been champion next year too if I hadn't been injured,» roars Combius, cheerfully. A quite untrue statement, but I let it pass.</p>
   <p>«<emphasis>Saxarth</emphasis> is just <emphasis>Thraxas</emphasis> backwards,» says Makri. «Couldn't you come up with something better?»</p>
   <p>«What are you doing here, Combius?»</p>
   <p>«Selling weapons. Set myself up as an armourer after I retired from fighting.»</p>
   <p>«Then you're just the man I've been looking for. This is Makri. She needs weapons for the tournament.»</p>
   <p>Combius looks at Makri in surprise. «You're entering the tournament?»</p>
   <p>«Couldn't you think of anything better than Saxarth?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>I purse my lips. «Could you drop the inquisition about my name? Yes, Combius, Makri is entering the tournament. She's currently bodyguard to the Head of the Sorcerers Guild and I give her every chance of doing well.»</p>
   <p>Combius doesn't look especially convinced, but he's not going to turn away our business. «I've got the full range here. What do you need?»</p>
   <p>«Everything. Sword, shield, mail shirt, gorget, mail gloves, helmet, boots, leggings. At a generous discount for an old companion, I trust.»</p>
   <p>Combius leads us behind his table and signals to a young assistant to help him find suitable armour for Makri.</p>
   <p>«She's a good deal thinner than anyone else I'm outfitting,» he muses. «Going to need some adjustments.»</p>
   <p>Makri has picked up a sword from the table and makes a few practice thrusts. As she walks down the row of merchandise, examining the various pieces of armour, Combius lowers his voice. «What's the idea, Saxarth? She's not really entering the tournament is she?»</p>
   <p>«She is.»</p>
   <p>«Did you lose your mind when Turai fell to the Orcs? People die in this tournament. Why risk the girl's life?»</p>
   <p>«She's not risking her life.»</p>
   <p>«Really? Orc blood isn't too popular around here. It's madness letting her enter.»</p>
   <p>By now Makri is trying on some of Combius's chainmail shirts, all of which are too large for her. She complains about the weight, comparing them unfavourably to the Orcish armour she left in Turai, something that doesn't go down well with Combius.</p>
   <p>«The Orcs can't make armour.»</p>
   <p>«Yes they can. Good armour.»</p>
   <p>Neither Combius nor his assistants look pleased. No western armourer will acknowledge that Orcish smiths have any skill.</p>
   <p>«How about that small shirt at the back?» I suggest, to move things along.</p>
   <p>«Might do,» says Combius. «It's a youth's size. Made if for a Baron's son. Killed in a horse riding accident before he could wear it, poor lad. I might be able to adjust it for her.»</p>
   <p>By the time we leave Combius's weapons tent Makri has purchased a sword, a shield, and chainmail gloves. We have to call back for the rest later, after alterations. Makri scowls at her sword.</p>
   <p>«It's blunt.»</p>
   <p>«Of course it's blunt. Can't you get it through your head that you're not meant to kill anyone?»</p>
   <p>«No. And I still think <emphasis>Saxarth</emphasis> was a poor choice of name. I'd have seen through it right away.»</p>
   <p>«Yes Makri, that's fascinating. Fortunately no one in Elath at the time had your mighty intellect. Now I have to eat. Which I should be able to do at that tent with the flag on top.»</p>
   <p>«The flag with a meat pie on it?»</p>
   <p>«That's the one. Lets go.»</p>
   <p>By now the fields are crowded, but it takes a good man to prevent Thraxas from advancing towards a meat pie. I clear a path, enter the tent, plant myself on an available bench and beckon a serving girl in our direction.</p>
   <p>«Three pies, a tankard of ale and whatever side dishes you have. And quickly, if you can, I haven't eaten for a long time.»</p>
   <p>The waitress looks towards Makri. Makri shakes her head, not wanting anything.</p>
   <p>«You should keep your strength up, Makri. You've got a tournament to win.»</p>
   <p>Makri's lips twist in a faint sneer. «I could win this tournament in my sleep. What do any of these people know about fighting? I slaughtered the entire honour guard of an Orc Lord on my own so I'm not about to start worrying about any tournament fighter.»</p>
   <p>«There will be a lot of good swordsmen here.»</p>
   <p>«None of them are any good.»</p>
   <p>I don't like Makri's over-confidence. «I'm telling you, there will be good fighters. Elupus, for instance.»</p>
   <p>Makri scoffs. «Elupus? He can't fight.»</p>
   <p>«How do you know that? You've never seen him in combat.»</p>
   <p>Makri shrugs. «I can tell. I wasn't impressed when I met him. I'll beat him. Easy as bribing a Senator. I'm more interested in Arichdamis and his inventions. Do you know he's making a special sort of huge crossbow for bringing down dragons? He showed me the plans.»</p>
   <p>It's my turn to be sceptical. «It will never work. People have tried before. You can't build anything big enough to fire an arrow tough enough to pierce a dragon's hide. The machine would be too cumbersome.»</p>
   <p>«Arichdamis doesn't think it's impossible. He's got a new swivel mounting which will allow for fast manoeuvrability. And he's invented this new sort of sight for aiming, it's got this little mirror in it, it was one of the cleverest things I've ever seen.»</p>
   <p>I'm about to pass an unfavourable opinion on the intellect of anyone foolish enough to think he can bring down a war-dragon with a crossbow when Makri unexpectedly looks sad.</p>
   <p>«I really wish Arichdamis could visit Samanatius,» she says. «But I expect Samanatius is dead.»</p>
   <p>There's not much to say to that. Samanatius is almost certainly dead. I doubt very much if the elderly philosopher escaped from the wreckage of Turai. Makri's gloom quickly transfers itself to me and I eat my pies rather quietly, thinking all the while about Gurd, Captain Rallee, Tanrose, and the other people I knew in Turai.</p>
   <p>«We should be marching back there right now, not sitting here,» declares Makri.</p>
   <p>«I know. But it takes time to get these things organised. Once Lisutaris has re-established her control over the Sorcerers Guild, we'll see some action.»</p>
   <p>Though the food marquee is busy, a small space has cleared around us. No one wants to sit next to Makri. If she notices, she doesn't let it show. I'm expecting some awkwardness when we enter her for the tournament. There's a smaller marquee where entrants put their name down for the competition. It's a bustling scene as contestants call out to each other, and swap friendly insults, while their supporters eye up the opposition and exchange information on the fighters' recent form. Here, even more than elsewhere, the Samsarinan class system has relaxed. Barons and their retinues mingle with their favourite sword fighters, trainers and armourers. As we approach, the banter subsides. The officials don't make any objections as Makri gives her name — the Samsarinan tournament prides itself on being open to anyone — but they're far from welcoming. I register Makri in an atmosphere of hostile silence.</p>
   <p>«I'm as welcome as an Orc at an Elvish wedding,» mutters Makri, as we emerge from the marquee.</p>
   <p>«True.»</p>
   <p>«Do you think Elves will ever invite me to a wedding?»</p>
   <p>«Probably not.»</p>
   <p>Now that Makri has entered the tournament, I'm keen to place some bets as soon as possible. There are several bookmakers taking bets on the tournament, all of them operating out of tents close to the fighting arena. The largest operation is run by Big Bixo. As far as I can learn, he's honest enough, if only because the whole operation is overseen by Baron Mabados himself, who, as presiding noble in the area, has a hand in most profitable business arising from the tournament. He'll have to hand over a good share of that profit to the King, of course, but it's still a good earner for the Baron.</p>
   <p>I ask Makri is she wants to accompany while I place my bets, but she declines. She has to accompany Lisutaris to a meeting. The first of the Elvish ambassadors have arrived, as well as military officials from Hadassa, Kamara, and other countries to the south and west. It's now several weeks since Turai fell, and it was several weeks before that the Orcs marched out of the East. Even so, the forces of the West still aren't ready to face them.</p>
   <p>«Lack of leadership,» says Makri. «Simnia and Samsarina are the largest states but they can't agree about anything. Nioj doesn't get along with anyone, and the League of City States is a shambles. What it needs is someone to take matters in hand.»</p>
   <p>«It wouldn't be so bad if the Elves had a decent warlord,» I say. «But even they seem to be disorganised at the moment. There's no natural War Leader. General Acarius is probably the only decent soldier we have left.»</p>
   <p>«But he's Juvalian,» says Makri, who has apparently become an expert on world politics. «Juval's a small place and Simnia and Samsarina won't follow a Juvalian. There's only one candidate — Lisutaris.»</p>
   <p>«Well maybe,» I say. «But there are a lot of soldiers who don't like having a Sorcerer as commander.»</p>
   <p>«The Head of the Sorcerers Guild has led the West to war before.»</p>
   <p>«That was a long time ago, and the Head of the Guild wasn't a woman then. I'm not sure the Simnians and the Samsarinans will follow Lisutaris. Where is she now?»</p>
   <p>Makri looks troubled. «Preparing a spell.»</p>
   <p>«For what?»</p>
   <p>«Making her new thazis plants grow faster. I'd better go. I need to make sure she's in a fit state for the meeting.»</p>
   <p>Makri hurries off, carrying her new armour. I shake my head, and carry on towards Big Bixo's tent. I need to acquaint myself with the odds on offer, and prepare my betting strategy. With limited resources, I have to plan carefully. When the tournament gets going properly, there are thirty-two fighters involved. However, to reach this stage, Makri will have to qualify. Of the thirty-two places, sixteen are available only by invitation. Some of these invitations go out to internationally renowned swordsmen. Others go to local champions, mainly sponsored by the Samsarinan Barons, and a few more to fighters backed by aristocrats from neighbouring countries. The remaining sixteen places are up for grabs, but it takes a good swordsman to win through. I had to qualify myself, and it was tough. Some of the fighters were highly skilled, even if they weren't well known. I'm gripped by a momentary worry that Makri isn't taking it seriously enough. I'm not certain she appreciates the standard of the opposition.</p>
   <p>I shake off the worry. Makri is the best fighter I've ever seen, and I've seen plenty. She'll win the competition. I enter Big Bixo's tent with an air of quiet determination. It's time to begin the process of reducing the Samsarinan bookmakers to despair.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Eleven</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>After placing my bets I head towards Baroness Demelzos's mansion, where I'm due to talk to her daughter Merlione. In Turai there were carriages for hire but the only carriages in Elath seem to belong to the Barons and their ilk. Commoners walk everywhere. The young servant who admits me is wearing a plain white tunic. I'd have expected Baron Mabados's servants to be wearing something fancier. Embroidered, at least. Maybe the Baron is too cheap to dress his servants well. Or maybe in Samsarina it's a sign of good taste to dress your servants plainly. I can't tell. I don't know the nuances of servants' apparel the way I did back in Turai. I don't know the nuances of any part of society here.</p>
   <p>«The Baroness asked me to escort you to our western reception room. Merlione is waiting for you.»</p>
   <p>For what is effectively a holiday home, it's a large enough place. We walk along plain white corridors hung with pictures of the Baron's ancestors, and past the central shrine, where I catch a glimpse of a rather modest statue of St Quatinius. It's some time since I prayed. In Turai it was standard to pray three times a day. Religious rules in Samsarina are different. There's a period in the evening when everything stops for prayer, but no set time during the day. Probably the Barons don't want their farmers suffering too many interruptions as they work in their fields.</p>
   <p>I've formed a picture of Demelzos's daughter as a shy girl, full of imaginary fears and worries. It turns out to be not particularly accurate. For one thing, she's a little older than I expected. Eighteen, perhaps. Old enough to have been married off in some favourable dynastic match. The fact that she hasn't been probably says something about the family, but I don't know what. She greets me in a confident enough manner. She's a reasonably attractive young woman — though I'm finding that harder to judge as I get older — dressed quite simply, with a plain blue robe over a long white dress that looks much the same as those worn by most woman in Elath. They're well-cut garments, but you wouldn't necessarily take her for a Baron's daughter. She isn't wearing any fancy jewellery, which would have been obligatory for a rich young woman in Turai. She does sport a discrete queenstone bracelet.</p>
   <p>I take a seat and get down to business. «I understand you think someone is trying to kill you?»</p>
   <p>«Someone is,» she says. «And no, I'm not imagining it.»</p>
   <p>«Who thinks you're imagining it?»</p>
   <p>«Everyone. But they're wrong. And Alceten's death wasn't an accident either, no matter what anyone says. She was murdered.»</p>
   <p>Merlione looks me in the eye, defying me not to believe her. She has very dark eyes. She looks a little like her mother did when she was younger. It gives me a faint memory of being a lot younger myself.</p>
   <p>«Tell me what happened.»</p>
   <p>«Only if you're here to help find out who killed her. If you're here to try and persuade me it was an accident, I'd rather not.»</p>
   <p>«I take it you weren't impressed by the original investigation?»</p>
   <p>Merlione laughs, quite bitterly. «Investigation? There was no investigation. Daringos, the King's Steward, asked a few questions and believed whatever was easiest for him to believe. The carriage that killed Alceten was owned by Baron Girimos so he wasn't going to cause any trouble there.»</p>
   <p>«Who's Baron Girimos?»</p>
   <p>Merlione looks at me in a rather less friendly manner. «Shouldn't you know that?»</p>
   <p>«I'm new in town.»</p>
   <p>«That wouldn't seem to qualify you to find out the truth.»</p>
   <p>«Indulge me. I have hidden talents. Who's Baron Girimos?»</p>
   <p>«He owns land all over the west of the country. Very rich and important. He's one of the King's main allies, so no one was going to accuse him of anything.»</p>
   <p>«Do you think Baron Girimos was behind the death of your friend?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. I can't see why he would be. But someone deliberately drove that carriage into Alceten. They said it was just runaway horses but I saw someone driving them. He was lying on the seat, almost hidden from view by the footboard. He couldn't ride properly like that, but he still whipped the horses into action and they mowed down Alceten. The carriage raced off down the street. When it was recovered there was no sign of a driver.»</p>
   <p>«And no one else saw him?»</p>
   <p>«No. But I did.»</p>
   <p>«This was in the evening? When it was dark?»</p>
   <p>«Quite dark, yes.»</p>
   <p>«And raining?»</p>
   <p>Merlione looks offended. «Yes, it was raining. But I know what I saw. There was someone in the carriage.»</p>
   <p>«Were there any other witnesses?»</p>
   <p>«Only Zinlantol. She works at the Record House. She told the King's Steward that there was no one driving the carriage. But she came out the building after Alceten, she can't have seen it properly.»</p>
   <p>«Has anyone explained why the horses bolted?»</p>
   <p>«Daringos told us they must have been startled by some dogs. There are dogs there, sometimes. But I didn't hear any of them barking.»</p>
   <p>I take this in. I have known horses to be startled into bolting by dogs. I've known people to be killed by runaway carriages too, in narrow city streets. I ask Merlione what she was doing outside the Royal Record House.</p>
   <p>«Alceten asked me to meet her. Her father was the Royal Record Keeper.»</p>
   <p>«Did you often meet her there?»</p>
   <p>«Not often,» says Merlione. «But sometimes we'd meet before going to the Queen's Bathing House. That day she sent me a message, saying she wanted to see me.»</p>
   <p>«What about?»«I don't know. The message just asked me to meet her in the evening.»</p>
   <p>«And you arrived just in time to see her killed. Do you have any idea at all what might be behind it? Had she any enemies?»</p>
   <p>«Not as far as I know.»</p>
   <p>«Have you?»</p>
   <p>Merlione shakes her head, though for the first time in our interview, she looks troubled. «I didn't think so. But I was very close to Alceten when she was run over. I think the carriage was hoping to run us both down. That's not all that's happened. Two days ago I was walking along King's Royal Way and a slate came off a roof and shattered right beside me.»</p>
   <p>«You think that wasn't an accident?»</p>
   <p>«I'm sure it wasn't.»</p>
   <p>I'm not immediately convinced. A slate falling from a roof isn't that uncommon. King's Royal Way, despite the fancy name, is a fairly dilapidated row of buildings that leads from the Baron's houses into the centre of Elath. The road is in poor repair, and so are the houses.</p>
   <p>Merlione sips water from a silver goblet. «Why did my mother hire you?» she asks, abruptly.</p>
   <p>«To find things out.»</p>
   <p>«But you're a stranger in town. Why you?»</p>
   <p>«I'm a professional investigator. You don't have any in Elath.»</p>
   <p>Merlione looks doubtful. «It seems odd to me. Did someone recommend you to her?»</p>
   <p>I'd rather avoid the subject of how I know Baroness Demelzos. It strikes me that I haven't had beer for a while.</p>
   <p>«Could you send for some beer?»</p>
   <p>«You mean wine?»</p>
   <p>«No, beer.»</p>
   <p>«I don't think we have any.»</p>
   <p>«Servants usually have some.»</p>
   <p>Merlione is surprised by my request, but claps her hands, causing a servant to hurry in.</p>
   <p>«Do we have any beer for our guest?»</p>
   <p>The servant gives me a look of withering contempt. «I believe the chef may have a supply in the kitchen.»</p>
   <p>Merlione is smiling as the servant leaves. «I don't think anyone has ever asked for beer before. Is it true you have an Orcish wife?»</p>
   <p>«No. I have a companion who is part-Orc.»</p>
   <p>«Is she very savage?»</p>
   <p>«At times. She's also a scholar.»</p>
   <p>«Really?» Merlione, who seems altogether friendlier since I asked for beer, leans forward, interested. «What does she study?»</p>
   <p>«Everything. Now we've moved in with Arichdamis she's been talking to him about measuring the volume of cones. Or cylinders. Or parabolas. Something like that, I'm not clear about it.»</p>
   <p>When the servant returns with my beer, I ask Merlione to tell me more of her circumstances. I'm not really convinced that her friend was murdered, or that her life is in danger, but I owe it to Baroness Demelzos to investigate properly. Partly because she's paying me, and partly because I did skip out without saying goodbye properly. Even if it was over twenty years ago, that bothers me a little.</p>
   <p>Most of what Merlione tells me I already had some idea of, from Demelzos — her brother's Orgodas's wedding for instance. The household is in a state of high excitement about his upcoming marriage to the eldest daughter of Baron Vosanos, yet another of Samsarina's wealthy nobles. I get the impression that Merlione isn't that close to her brother, or her father, and may not be as interested in the wedding as she should be. I wonder if that might be influencing her reluctance to leave the house, though insisting your life is in danger just to avoid a wedding does seem like taking things to extremes.</p>
   <p>Merlione doesn't seem to have any other close friends, even though Elath has plentiful supply of Baron's daughters, who should be suitable companions. But she's a serious young woman, studious maybe. Not the type to spend her time shopping and gossiping. As I take my leave I'm not sure what to make of the whole affair. I have some sympathy for Merlione, who seems like an isolated figure, but whether or not there's any truth in her suspicions, I can't tell.</p>
   <p>Outside it's started to rain. The water flows neatly down the gutters in the paved roads around the Barons' houses, but further into town, where the roads are not so well constructed, the earth is beginning to cut up. Many of the buildings are poorly maintained. It wouldn't surprise me if slates fell off the roofs all the time. I walk past the town hall, another not-very-impressive, grey stone construction, and take a look at the water clock in the main square, beside the statue of St Quatinius. The clock was designed, so Makri informs me, by Arichdamis. Water flows through underground pipes and makes it work. I've no idea how.</p>
   <p>By now Elath is filling up with people, many of them exotic by local standards. That's partly because of the tournament, and partly because of the approach of war. There's an odd atmosphere. A mixture of anticipation and fear. I recognise the emotion. I've seen it before. People feel reckless, wanting to have some enjoyment in what might be the last weeks of their lives. One or two Elves have appeared, having either risked an early voyage from the Southern Isles, or come overland from neighbouring lands. Sorcerers, mercenaries, soldiers, generals and ambassadors are all arriving in Elath. The King's Guard has increased their patrols, looking for suspicious characters. It strikes me that I'm here in the company of undoubtedly the most suspicious character in the entire country, namely Makri. If she wasn't employed by Lisutaris she'd have been run out of town already, and probably me as well.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twelve</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I'm looking forward to a few ales and a pie from the larder when I get back to Arichdamis's house. Unfortunately I find the house in uproar, or as much uproar as can be created by one elderly mathematician, two servants and an agitated part-Orc swordswoman, all of whom are engaged in near-incomprehensible babble as I enter the hallway. I have to shout to make myself heard.</p>
   <p>«Makri? Shouldn't you be at a meeting with Lisutaris?»</p>
   <p>Makri whirls round. «Lisutaris can't go!»</p>
   <p>«Why not?»</p>
   <p>«Too much thazis. She can't move.»</p>
   <p>This isn't a huge surprise. I've seen Lisutaris unable to move after too much thazis. Notably, a couple of years ago when I was trapped in a Sorcerer's mansion in Thamlin with a maddened crowd outside baying for blood. On that occasion it took a hefty slap to bring her round. I expect something similar will produce results now. Makri leads me to where Lisutaris is lying in the gardens, her head resting comfortably on a small hillock, a peaceful smile on her face. Beside her is a pile of ash. I take her by the shoulder and shake her.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris. Important meeting. Barons and Sorcerers. You have to get up.»</p>
   <p>She doesn't stir. I shake her harder.</p>
   <p>«It's no good,» cries Makri. «She made a new spell for making Arichdamis's thazis more powerful and she's overdone it. What are we going to do?»</p>
   <p>Horses hooves clatter along the road, coming to a halt outside Arichdamis house.</p>
   <p>«That must be messengers from Lasat, wondering where Lisutaris is,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>I notice that Makri's hand has drifted towards her sword. «Killing the messengers won't help. They'd just send more.»</p>
   <p>It's time for swift action. I drag Lisutaris to her feet and thrust her into the arms of Arichdamis and a servant.</p>
   <p>«Walk her round the garden. Makri, come with me.» I march back though the house and open the front door to find two messengers on the doorstep.</p>
   <p>«Lasat Axe of Gold begs to know when Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, plans to arrive at the meeting.»</p>
   <p>I regard them coolly. «Lasat Axe of Gold must have made a mistake. Lisutaris reconvened the meeting here.»</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«The meeting is to be held here, in Arichdamis's residence.»</p>
   <p>«But it's meant to be at Lasat's. He won't be pleased at this.»</p>
   <p>I draw myself up. «Lisutaris is Head of the Sorcerers Guild. She outranks Lasat. In fact, she outranks everyone. So if Lisutaris wants to hold the meeting here, that's where it will be held. Kindly tell Lasat that Lisutaris regrets the mix up in communications, but looks forward to everyone assembling here at their earliest convenience. And pass on the best regards of Thraxas, Chief Adviser to the Head of the Sorcerers Guild.»</p>
   <p>The messengers don't like it. Still, it's not their job to argue. They mount up, and ride off. Beside me, Makri is impressed. «You really pulled that off well.»</p>
   <p>«Thank you.»</p>
   <p>«Although it does strike me that in around fifteen minutes, a collection of angry Barons and Sorcerers are going to discover that Lisutaris is completely intoxicated by thazis, in a country where thazis is illegal.»</p>
   <p>«So we've got fifteen minutes to get Lisutaris into a fit state.»</p>
   <p>We hurry back to the garden where Arichdamis and his servant — both quite elderly, and neither of them strong — are still gamely walking Lisutaris around the garden. So far, it doesn't seem to be helping.</p>
   <p>«It was very unwise of Lisutaris to boost the power of her thazis,» says Arichdamis, who seems shocked by the occurrence. «Is the Mistress of the Sky prone to this sort of excess?»</p>
   <p>«Very rarely,» I reply, and send the other servant off to make deat, a herbal brew with some powers of sobering up the intoxicated. Makri and I take over walking Lisutaris around while Arichdamis slumps into a garden chair to rest.</p>
   <p>«You might want to tell your servants that Barons, Sorcerers and probably some foreign ambassadors will be arriving soon.»</p>
   <p>Arichdamis leaps to his feet. «What? I'm not ready to receive Barons. We have no food prepared, or drink, or»</p>
   <p>«Tell them there's a war on. Everyone has to rough it a little. Damn you Lisutaris, will you stop grinning stupidly and open your eyes?»</p>
   <p>As soon as Arichdamis disappears inside I fetch Lisutaris a fairly hefty slap on the face. Her eyelids flicker. So desperate is the situation that Makri doesn't object. Lisutaris opens her eyes.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas, if you slap me again I'll make your head explode.»</p>
   <p>We sit Lisutaris down on the garden chair and start pouring deat inside her. The Sorceress shakes her head.</p>
   <p>«Spell must have been too powerful. But Arichdamis's thazis is inferior. I was just trying to boost it a little.» She yawns. «I'd better lie down for a while.»</p>
   <p>«You can't lie down!» exclaims Makri. «Have you forgotten the meeting?»</p>
   <p>«Meeting?»</p>
   <p>Makri brings Lisutaris up to date with recent developments. Lisutaris's eyes open wide.</p>
   <p>«I don't want to meet Barons. I'm not ready.»</p>
   <p>Horses hooves and carriage wheels sound in the street outside. Lisutaris casts a baleful glance in my direction, then rises to her feet. Her legs give way and she slumps back into her chair.</p>
   <p>«I can't walk,» she says, rather feebly.</p>
   <p>«Arichdamis,» I say. «Tell the Barons that Lisutaris will receive them in the back garden.»</p>
   <p>At this moment the junior dragon, until now absent from the proceedings, decides to put in an appearance. It wanders out from a clump of bushes and makes straight for Makri.</p>
   <p>«Go away you vile beast,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>The dragon starts rubbing itself against Makri's legs. Makri tries to shove it away, which only makes it more enthusiastic. It rises on its hind legs and tries to lick her face. Makri winces as it digs its claws into her shoulder. She bats it back to the ground, quite violently. The dragon, thinking this is a splendid game, purrs in pleasure and starts climbing up her again.</p>
   <p>«I'm getting fed up with this,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>Baron Mabados, Baron Marcos, and Lasat Axe of Gold come storming into the garden.</p>
   <p>«What is the meaning of this change of location?» demands Lasat. «It shows an outrageous lack of respect for the council.»</p>
   <p>Elupus, his bodyguard, is next into the garden. Several more Samsarinan Barons follow, along with their entourages. After them come a group of Sorcerers, including Kublinos, and various men in military uniform, Generals from the Samsarinan army. Finally Daringos, the King's Chief Steward, resplendent in his crimson robe, strides in with his nose in the air. There's some confusion, with questions being asked from all sides. The loudest voice comes from a Baron I haven't met before, an extremely large man, at least in girth, who demands to know where the refreshments are.</p>
   <p>«Don't tell me we've been invited to a house where's there's nothing to eat?» he says, looking round the empty gardens with some dismay.</p>
   <p>«Never mind food, Baron Girimos,» says Daringos. «I'm still waiting to hear why Lisutaris has chosen to inconvenience us all.»</p>
   <p>A full complement of hostile eyes turn towards Lisutaris. Unfortunately she hasn't yet recovered her wits. She looks around her, eyes not quite focused, and mumbles something unintelligible. Lasat studies her very suspiciously. I think he might be sniffing the air for traces of thazis. I hurriedly put my foot over the pile of ash.</p>
   <p>«It's quite simple,» declares Makri, loudly. «And Thraxas, Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, will now explain everything.»</p>
   <p>I purse my lips. This was always going to be the difficult part. A flaw in my plan, you might say. But only if you were unacquainted with exactly how resourceful a man like Thraxas can be in a crisis. Sharp as an Elves ear, as my admirers have been know to say. I march over to the table, sweep up Arichdamis's plans for the crossbow sight, and brandish them dramatically.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris realised that Arichdamis — finest inventor, mathematician, and scientist in the West — has hit upon a device so vital, so important to our war effort, that she was unable to leave it unguarded. She decided, quite rightly, that the meeting must be re-convened here, to prevent any risk of it falling into enemy hands, before she's had time to construct a mighty spell of protection.»</p>
   <p>Lasat Axe of Gold frowns. «Couldn't she just have brought the plans with her?»</p>
   <p>«Too important to carry around,» I say, though I know right away it's not the most convincing of answers.</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris has also been busy helping me look after the young dragon,» says Makri. «You know how important that is to the King.» At this moment the young dragon decides to give Makri a playful nip on the ankle. «Damn you!» she cries, and deals it a hefty kick in the ribs.</p>
   <p>Lasat Axe of Gold is by this time looking completely exasperated, and from the expression on Chief Steward Daringos's face, he won't be reporting that favourably on Lisutaris to the King.</p>
   <p>«Perhaps the Mistress of the Sky would like to tell us herself why she summoned us here,» he says.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris rises to her feet, a little shakily. «As my Chief Adviser has explained, I've been engaged in important work. I would not have wished to report to the King that the unwillingness of his Sorcerers to travel a short distance had led to the loss of our new weapon.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris hasn't really said anything more convincing that Makri or I, but she has an air of authority, and it sounds better coming from her.</p>
   <p>«What is this weapon?» enquires Baron Mabados.</p>
   <p>«An advanced crossbow featuring a special sighting device which will enable our troops to bring down an Orcish war-dragon in full flight.»</p>
   <p>«What?» exclaims Mabados. «That's impossible. No bolt from a crossbow could pierce a dragons hide,»</p>
   <p>«I plan to build a device which can fire an eighteen-inch steel shaft with a hardened tip right through its scales,» says Arichdamis, in defence of his pet project.</p>
   <p>«To fire such a heavy bolt high and fast into the sky would require a crossbow of tremendous power,» protests Mabados, who's seen dragons in combat. «Surely such a machine would be too bulky and slow moving? Dragons don't just hang around in the sky, waiting to be shot.»</p>
   <p>«My crossbow is mounted on a rotating trestle and uses a new type of sighting device. I believe I can hit a dragon in mid-flight.»</p>
   <p>Arichdamis's claims are met by some cynicism by the assembled visitors, particularly the military men. But by now, everyone's attention is being drawn towards Makri and the dragon. After some tussles back and forth, the creature has settled down comfortably at her feet.</p>
   <p>«Is that beast purring?» asks one of the Generals, a dark, weather-beaten man in a green military cloak.</p>
   <p>«My bodyguard Makri has a way with wild creatures,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>It is quite an impressive sight. The baby dragon, previously known for its aggression, now seems almost docile in Makri's presence.</p>
   <p>«Have you experience with dragons?» asks the General.</p>
   <p>«I fought one in the arena when I was fifteen,» replies Makri, and no one scoffs at her reply. Even Elupus looks thoughtful.</p>
   <p>With Lisutaris now regaining control of the situation, I take the opportunity to study our visitors. Most of them are still occupied by the sight of Makri and the dragon, but Baron Girimos is looking round him with the attitude of a hungry man. I wouldn't mind talking to Girimos. According to Merlione, he owned the carriage that killed Alceten. I sidle up to him and lower my voice.</p>
   <p>«You'll have to excuse Arichdamis for his lack of preparation. He's too eccentric to provide proper refreshments for his guests.»</p>
   <p>«It's really most unsatisfactory,» says the Baron, with feeling.</p>
   <p>I nod sympathetically. «Don't worry, his servants keep the cellars and pantries well-stocked. Come with me and I'll put matters in hand.»</p>
   <p>Baron Girimos follows me eagerly back into the house. Behind us Makri is answering questions from the General about her days as a gladiator, while Chief Steward Daringos is reminding everyone that they still have a meeting to get through. Downstairs in the food cellars, I find the Baron quite a genial companion. Eschewing ceremony, he takes a whole smoked ham from a hook, drags out a crate to use as a chair, and gets to work. I take another whole ham for myself, fetch two bottles of wine and a small barrel of Elath Mountain Beer from the room next door, and join him on the next crate. We eat and drink heartily, and swap a few war stories. Like me, the Baron has fought against the Orcs. Along with his hearty appetite, it's another point in his favour.</p>
   <p>«Of course, I was in better shape back then,» says the Baron, patting his considerable belly. «Could you hand me down that duck from the shelf?»</p>
   <p>While sharing the cooked duck, I manoeuvre the conversation round to the present, and manage to gain quite a lot of background information about affairs among the Barons. On the topic of Demelzos and Mabados's marriage, and the upcoming wedding of their son, he's quite informative.</p>
   <p>«Mabados got lucky,» he tells me, while starting on a second bottle of fine red Elvish wine. «Married the richest girl in the country. Commoner, of course, which raised a few eyebrows. Not as many as you'd think, mind you, when word got round about how much money she had. Her father found more queenstone than anyone had ever seen. And Mabados's family was broke. Everyone knew that, though they tried to hide it.» Baron Girimos laughs. «He'd still be broke if it wasn't for her income.»</p>
   <p>«But he controls Elath. Isn't that lucrative, with the baths, and the tournament?»</p>
   <p>«Should be, if he wasn't such a fool with money. Terrible gambler, you know. And he made some bad investments in shipping that all went down the drain. The yield from his farms hasn't been that great recently, either. Doesn't matter too much though, while they've got the Queenstone mines.»</p>
   <p>All of Demelzos's property will, of course, have been transferred to the Baron on their marriage, enabling him to waste money as he chooses. I ask Girimos about the upcoming wedding.</p>
   <p>«I'll be a fancy affair. Mabados's son and Baron Vosanos's eldest daughter. Vosanos is one of the wealthiest men in the country. Shouldn't be surprised if they bring in some top foreign chefs for the catering.» Baron Girimos obviously relishes the idea of a banquet prepared by top foreign chefs. It's not hard to see why he's a man of such impressive girth. I'm liking him more and more. By this time the Baron is so genial it's not difficult to raise the subject of the runaway carriage that killed Alceten.</p>
   <p>«Sad affair,» says the Baron. «Still no idea who took the carriage.»</p>
   <p>«It was stolen?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. It disappeared from my stables the night before the accident. Thieves up to no good, no doubt. Elath's like that, when the tournament's on. A lot of rascals arrive in town.»</p>
   <p>When we emerge from the cellars, the meeting is well under way. Given the unpromising start, it goes quite well. Lisutaris talks with authority about her plans for rallying Sorcerers, troops, and governments. Lasat and his detestable minion Charius attempt to undermine her, but I wouldn't say they have the best of it. Lisutaris is still labouring under the disadvantage of having allowed Turai to fall, but she's been in battle on many occasions, and her reputation as a war-time Sorcerer remains high. Several of Samsarina's leading military men have seen her in action, back in the Orc wars when they were junior officers and she was a promising young Sorcerer. The meeting adjourns, and arrangements are made to talk with the King in two days time, along with several more foreign ambassadors who should have arrived in Elath by then.</p>
   <p>«I'd say you're still in a strong position,» I tell Lisutaris, after the Barons have departed. «Particularly as the Elves will still support you.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris is not convinced. «Did you see the way Lasat objected to everything I said? The man hates me.» The Sorceress frowns. «Why did you tell everyone I was protecting Arichdamis's new weapon like it was the most important thing in the world?»</p>
   <p>«I had to come up with something to cover for you.»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so. But I'm going to look silly if this weapon doesn't work. Where is Arichdamis, anyway?»</p>
   <p>«Examining the ruin of his cellars. Baron Girimos has a very hearty appetite. I tried to restrain him but it was practically impossible. Who was that General who seemed so interested in Makri?»</p>
   <p>«General Hemistos. He's in charge of the infantry phalanxes.»</p>
   <p>«Hemistos? The young centurion who led the expedition over Gazgar Bridge?» I remember him now. He was decorated for his bravery, eighteen or so years ago. I didn't know he'd become a General. «Just goes to show, some countries reward their war heroes properly. If Turai was like that, I'd be a General too.»</p>
   <p>«Undoubtedly,» says Lisutaris, and brushes her long brown hair back from her forehead. She stares at her silver and queenstone bracelet. A present from Kublinos, I believe.</p>
   <p>«I apologise for my mistake with the thazis. I won't allow it to happen again.»</p>
   <p>Makri has finally got rid of the dragon, shooing it back to its nest in the trees. «General Hemistos wants to watch me fighting at the tournament,» she says. «Was he really the most decorated centurion in the last war?»</p>
   <p>«Maybe,» I reply. «But you know these Samsarinans. They give out medals for anything.»</p>
   <p>«Where are the plans?» says Lisutaris, suddenly.</p>
   <p>«What plans?»</p>
   <p>«The plans for the crossbow and sighting device. You know, the important military secret I'm meant to be protecting.»</p>
   <p>«They're on the table.»</p>
   <p>«No they're not.»</p>
   <p>We all stare at the table. The plans are gone. I yell for Arichdamis. He pokes his head out of the window. He doesn't have them. The four of us engage on a frantic search of the vicinity. The blueprints are nowhere to be found. Arichdamis moans, and sits down heavily.</p>
   <p>«How can they just disappear?» demands Makri.</p>
   <p>I ask Lisutaris if she can perform some sort of quick searching spell. Unfortunately Lisutaris is no longer listening. Her bag of thazis is open on her lap. She swiftly rolls a huge stick, snaps her fingers to ignite it, then inhales deeply. I sit down next to her.</p>
   <p>«Give me some of that,» I say.</p>
   <p>«Me too,» says Makri. «We're really in trouble now.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Thirteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Gloom descends over Arichdamis's house. It's hard to believe that someone stole the plans from right under our noses. Arichdamis is frantic, believing that enemy spies have made off with them. He's already imagining himself being executed for treason. Neither Lisutaris, Makri nor I believe that an enemy spy took the plans. It's far more likely that Lasat Axe of Gold was behind it.</p>
   <p>«He'll do anything to discredit me,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«If Lasat did take them, what will he do with them?» wonders Makri.</p>
   <p>«He'll produce them whenever he thinks it's most damaging,» says Lisutaris. «Probably along with some fake story about an Orcish spy stealing them from me, and him heroically recovering them.»</p>
   <p>«We should have reported the theft when it happened!» says Arichdamis. «Now it looks like we're colluding with the enemy.»</p>
   <p>«We can't let anyone know. It will look too bad for Lisutaris.»</p>
   <p>Arichdamis has taken to pulling anxiously on his long grey beard. He goes away muttering about what a black day it was that he allowed Turanians into his house. Relations between us, previously cordial, have plummeted. Makri watches him go. «Now we've offended Arichdamis,» she says, and sounds genuinely upset.</p>
   <p>«If we're sure Lasat took the plans, shouldn't we be trying to get them back?» I suggest.</p>
   <p>«Lasat will have them well hidden by now,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«So? You're more powerful than he is. Or you were till recently.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris's eyes blaze. «What do you mean by that?»</p>
   <p>«I mean you don't have so much power when you're continually intoxicated by thazis.»</p>
   <p>«Don't lecture me on intoxication,» cries Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Why not? You haven't been thazis-free since you set foot in this place. No wonder Lasat got the better of you.»</p>
   <p>«You're being unfair!» says Makri. «After all, Lasat is a secret addict too. He takes dwa, remember? Probably he's even more intoxicated than Lisutaris, some of the time.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not intoxicated!» cries Lisutaris. «If I was, could I do this?»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress whips out a vial of kuriya, a black liquid used for various magical purposes. For most Sorcerers, controlling it is a difficult art. Not so for Lisutaris. She pours the liquid into a saucer and snaps her fingers.</p>
   <p>«I'll show you who's intoxicated. Kuriya, where are the plans?»</p>
   <p>Makri and I peer at the pool of dark liquid. Lisutaris, using her mighty powers, should be able to produce a picture of the current location of the missing item. We stare for a long time. Nothing happens. The Mistress of the Sky tries again.</p>
   <p>«Show me the location of Arichdamis's plans.» Nothing happens. «The moons are obviously in the wrong alignment,» says Lisutaris. «I must consult my charts.»</p>
   <p>With that, she strides off briskly, leaving a non-functioning kuriya pool behind her. Makri looks at me with a worried expression. «Are her powers really on the wane?»</p>
   <p>I shrug. «It's hard to say. Looking at the kuriya is always difficult, and it hasn't been working well for a lot of Sorcerers lately. The three moons do go through cycles. Maybe we're entering a bad one.»</p>
   <p>Makri's first fight is scheduled for later in the day. Both she and Lisutaris are planning to visit the Queen's Bathing House before going on to the tournament field. I'm heading off to investigate. I'm still far from certain that there's really anything that needs investigating, but I'll do it anyway. I plan to visit the King's Record House, where Alceten died, to examine the scene and ask questions. There were witnesses who should be worth talking to. Before I leave the house I offer a final word of encouragement to Makri.</p>
   <p>«I've bet all our money on you. If you don't win your fight we'll be begging on the streets.»</p>
   <p>Equipping Makri used up most of the money I borrowed from Baroness Demelzos. I only had sixty gurans left, a frustratingly small sum given the good odds which were available at the bookmaker. Big Bixo was offering six to one on Makri winning her first fight, sixteen to one on her qualifying from her group, and a hundred to one on her winning the tournament. I'd hoped that her odds for winning the tournament might be better, given that she's completely unknown, but the bookmakers here won't offer anything larger, in case an unknown fighter turns up who happens to be a sword-fighting prodigy. That's extremely rare, but it has happened. No one knew me when I gloriously defeated all opposition all those years ago.</p>
   <p>After studying the odds for a while, and weighing up my options, I place thirty gurans on Makri to win her first fight, and thirty more on her winning the whole tournament. I still regret only having sixty gurans to gamble with, but at least it's a start.</p>
   <p>By now Elath is really starting to come alive. There's hardly a room to be had anywhere. Visitors are camped out in tents in the fields around the town. Everywhere you go, people are discussing the chances of their favourites, or passing on bits of gossip about who's in good form with a sword, who might have an injury, or who might have been spending too much time in taverns. Elupus is still the popular favourite but there's plenty of backing for other famous fighters. Gabril-ixx, from some isle in the far north, won a tournament recently and is getting a lot of attention. So is Uzbister, from Mattesh. He was out of action for a year following a bad shoulder wound, but now he's back, and he's a popular fighter.</p>
   <p>The King's Record House, behind the town hall in the main square, is another ugly building. The road in front is narrow. Not much room for dodging if a carriage were heading your way. There are two guards at the door but they hardly bother to look at me as I enter, and don't acknowledge my announcement that I'm Chief Adviser to the Head of the Sorcerers Guild, here on official business. Inside, the building is no more impressive. A few pillars, an old statue of Saint Quatinius, some small stone figures of minor saints, and a badly designed fresco of an ancient Samsarinan King marching off to war. There's only one person in sight, a woman with long, greying hair, sitting behind a very large wooden desk, writing something in a ledger. I greet her politely.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas of Turai, Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky.»</p>
   <p>I'm expecting this middle-aged record keeper to be hostile but instead she greets me quite warmly. Maybe she's bored at work. Though she's plainly dressed, I notice she has a nice pair of queenstone earrings.</p>
   <p>«How can I help you?»</p>
   <p>«I'm looking for Zinlantol.»</p>
   <p>«I'm Zinlantol.»</p>
   <p>«I'm told you were a witness when Alceten was killed.»</p>
   <p>Zinlantol's lips compress. She puts down her quill. Suddenly, she's not so friendly.</p>
   <p>«I was. I'd rather not talk about it.»</p>
   <p>«I'd just like to ask you a few questions.»</p>
   <p>Zinlantol is about my age, maybe a little older. She has a surprisingly steely gaze. «Who sent you?» she demands.</p>
   <p>«Baroness Demelzos.»</p>
   <p>Zinlantol looks at me very suspiciously, wondering if I'm telling the truth. «Did you actually see the accident?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«Can you tell me what happened?»</p>
   <p>«I already told Chief Steward Daringos everything I know. He conducted a very thorough investigation.»</p>
   <p>That seems like an odd answer. I haven't implied that he didn't. I persevere. «Did you see any sign of a driver in the carriage that knocked Alceten over?»</p>
   <p>«Of course not. I would have reported it if I had. It was simply an accident. The horses weren't secured properly, and they bolted.»</p>
   <p>«Why?»</p>
   <p>«Pardon?»</p>
   <p>«Why did they bolt?»</p>
   <p>«Presumably something startled them.»</p>
   <p>«But you don't know what?»</p>
   <p>«No. I'd only just left the building when the accident happened. All I saw was poor Alceten being run down.»</p>
   <p>«It doesn't sound like you had much time to see what was happening. I hear it was raining too. Heavy rain. Visibility can't have been that good. How can you be sure there was no driver?»</p>
   <p>Zinlantol rises to her feet. «If you have no official business at the King's Record House, I think it's time for you to leave.»</p>
   <p>We stare at each other. I take in her dress, the plain woollen drape that covers her shoulders, and a thin metal band on her ring finger, all of them cheap. But then there's the valuable queenstone earrings.</p>
   <p>«Nice earrings,» I say. «A present from a friend?»</p>
   <p>The record keeper abruptly spins on her heel and walks off, disappearing from view through a door marked 'private.' I walk towards the entrance, past the statue of Saint Quatinius. I think he might be staring at me.</p>
   <p>«That's what I do,» I tell him. «Bully middle-aged women for a living.»</p>
   <p>The soldiers outside the door ignore me as I leave. They're discussing the tournament.</p>
   <p>«Elupus will win it again,» says one «I've got my money down already.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Fourteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>The weather is improving rapidly. Spring appears quickly in these parts. It's warm, and I'm labouring slightly as I make my way towards the Bathing Houses to meet Lisutaris and Makri. As I pass the King's Bathing House, General Hemistos emerges looking clean, healthy and weather-beaten. To my great surprise, he greets me in very friendly manner.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas, wasn't it? Is your companion Makri due to fight today?»</p>
   <p>«She should be, unless the other fights run late.»</p>
   <p>«Excellent,» says the General. «I look forward to it. Was she really champion gladiator of the Orcish lands?»</p>
   <p>There's an eager tone in Hemistos's voice which makes him sound younger than his years. I recognise the tone. I've heard young men sounding eager about Makri. Usually when they've just seen her walk by in the tavern wearing her chainmail bikini. General Hemistos is full of questions, and even when we encounter Baron Girimos and Harbour Sorcerer Kublinos, he doesn't stop. We meet a few more Barons, all heading to the Queen's Bathing house to pick up their wives before heading to the tournament. Normally I'd be shunned by such a company but such is their interest in Makri that for once I'm a welcome guest.</p>
   <p>«She usually favours a twin sword technique, I believe?» says the General. «Will she be able to cope with a sword and a shield?»</p>
   <p>«She should,» I reply. «Makri can use any sort of weapon.»</p>
   <p>While it's gratifying not to be shunned, I'm not actually all that pleased about Makri's sudden rise to prominence. I'd rather she remained an outsider. If these Barons start favouring her, her odds will plummet. It was a mistake for her to appear in front of them all yesterday, shoving that young dragon around like it was a puppy. And of course, in her frankly-indecent man's tunic and leggings, she was exhibiting a lot more female shape than they're used to seeing. No wonder she got their attention.</p>
   <p>«Vosanos!» calls Baron Girimos. «Just arrived in town?»</p>
   <p>I recognise the name. Baron Vosanos, father of the girl that Demelzos's son is marrying. I observe him as he walks across the busy road to join his fellow Barons. He's an elderly man, the oldest Baron in view by some way. Slightly built, long, thinning grey hair, with a polished walking stick in his hand. Despite the warmth in the air, he's wearing a heavy cloak, with a thick fur collar, the sort of cloak that lets you know the owner has plenty of money. His daughter's a good match for Demelzos's son, according to everyone.</p>
   <p>«I say!» says General Hemistos, loudly. All eyes follow his in the direction of the Queen's Bathing house. The marble steps leading down to the road are busy with women going in and out. All of them wealthy, and all of them perfectly attired. As is Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, who walks down the steps with her normal straight-backed elegance, robe and rainbow cloak perfectly arranged, not a hair out of place. Beside her is Makri who has not bothered to get fully dressed before leaving the building, and strolls down the stairs still pulling her tunic over her head. With a lot of flesh on display, two swords at her hip and a her still-wet hair flopping all over the place, she makes for an unusual sight.</p>
   <p>«Good Lord!» says the elderly Baron Vosanos. «Who is that?»</p>
   <p>«Makri,» says the Simnian Ambassador, who joined the party a little while ago. «Lisutaris's bodyguard. She's fighting in the tournament.»</p>
   <p>«Splendid figure,» barks the Baron. «Haven't seen anything like that since I was out in the East.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris seems gratified to find a large collection of Barons outside the Bathing House. She greets them politely, exchanging pleasantries.</p>
   <p>«I think they're starting to take to me,» she says, as we head towards the tournament fields.</p>
   <p>«Where's your amour and shield?» I ask Makri.</p>
   <p>«Right here,» says Lisutaris, dangling a tiny yellow purse by it's drawstring.</p>
   <p>«A magic pocket? Where did you get that?» Magic pockets are valuable items. You can carry around any amount of heavy items safely inside, all apparently weightless and without volume, until you take them out again.</p>
   <p>«Kublinos lent it to me. He's lending me a carriage as well.»</p>
   <p>The qualifying round starts later this afternoon, but until the draw is made, we won't know exactly when Makri is fighting. Reaching the tournament fields with time to spare, we take a stroll through the busy tents and stalls.</p>
   <p>«Look at that sign — <emphasis>Pie eating contest. Prize — fifty gurans</emphasis>.» I come to a swift halt. «I could win that. Easy as bribing a senator.»</p>
   <p>«You'd be a clear favourite,» agrees Makri. «Are you going to enter?»</p>
   <p>«No, he's not,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Why am I not?»</p>
   <p>«How is it going to reflect on the status of the Head of the Sorcerers Guild if her Chief Adviser is found wallowing around in a pie eating contest?»</p>
   <p>I admit she has a point, though it galls me to pass up the opportunity.</p>
   <p>«Maybe he could enter under a false name?» suggests Makri. «Saxarth perhaps?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris dismisses this. «That wouldn't fool anyone.»</p>
   <p>«We could do with the fifty gurans,» I point out. «We have no funds left.»</p>
   <p>«But you've bet on me, haven't you?» says Makri. «So that's guaranteed winnings.»</p>
   <p>I hope so. I still don't like Makri's over-confidence. We press on through the crowd, heading for the large marquee where the draw will be made. It takes a while to force our way through. Even Lisutaris's rainbow cloak, easily recognisable, isn't enough to make the crowd part without a struggle. I'm obliged to use my bodyweight to clear the local peasantry out the way.</p>
   <p>«You'd think they would pay more respect to the Head of the Sorcerers Guild,» I say, as I clear a path. «Not to mention me. I'm a past-champion. These stalls should be selling figurines of me.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe there should be a large statue,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«I don't see why not. There's not been many warriors like Saxarth the Invincible, I can tell you.»</p>
   <p>Makri laughs. «Never mind. At least Demelzos remembers you fondly.»</p>
   <p>This brings Lisutaris to an abrupt halt. «Baroness Demelzos? What does she remember fondly?»</p>
   <p>«Thraxas.»</p>
   <p>«Why?»</p>
   <p>«They had a passionate affair, a long time ago.»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress gapes. «Thraxas had an affair with Baroness Demelzos? Is this true?»</p>
   <p>«She wasn't Baroness Demelzos then,» I say. «She was Demmy the barmaid.»</p>
   <p>«I can't believe it,» says Lisutaris. «Thraxas and Demelzos? The mind reels.»</p>
   <p>I'm not feeling very pleased by any of this. For one thing, Makri shouldn't have blabbed about it, and for another, Lisutaris doesn't have to react as if it's the strangest occurrence in the history of the world.</p>
   <p>«Why were you so rude to her in Orosis?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I didn't recognise her. It was more than twenty years since I'd seen her. And I'd had one or two beers.»</p>
   <p>«It must have been a shock for the Baroness,» says Makri. «Seeing her past return to haunt her in the shape of Thraxas. No woman could be prepared for that.»</p>
   <p>«You should have told me this earlier!» cries Lisutaris. «Have you had affairs with any other members of the Samsarinan aristocracy?»</p>
   <p>«Is it any of your business?»</p>
   <p>«Of course. You're my Chief Adviser. I don't want to be discomfited by shocking revelations from the past. Does Baron Mabados know about this?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«That's just as well.»</p>
   <p>«I knew Demelzos before she ever met the Baron,» I point out. «It's not like she cheated on him.»</p>
   <p>«He'd still be furious. How would he feel if the other Barons learned his wife was once rolling around with a sword-fighter?»</p>
   <p>«I don't care what Baron Mabados feels about anything. Here's the Marquee we're looking for.»</p>
   <p>I head inside to make enquiries, leaving Lisutaris and Makri beside the area sectioned off for fighters to warm up. The organisers have just completed the draw for the qualifying rounds and are busy pinning up lists of fighters. There are forty-eight hopefuls, of whom sixteen will qualify for the tournament proper. The organisers have divided these forty-eight fighters into eight groups of six. I already know the rules but I scan them again, just to be certain. All the fighters in each group fight each other once. The winner is awarded one point. The top two from each group qualify for the real competition. Makri will have five fights. She shouldn't have any difficulty finishing in the top two. The only bad thing is that Makri's group is the last to be scheduled, which means a long wait.</p>
   <p>I head back to the warm-up area where Makri is now in conversation with General Hemistos. Kublinos has also put in appearance and is standing close to Lisutaris. I tell Makri what's expected of her.</p>
   <p>«I'll win the group,» she says, matter-of-factly.</p>
   <p>«You should warm up,» I suggest.</p>
   <p>Makri shrugs. «I won't be fighting for a while. I'll do it later.»</p>
   <p>«Ah, Mistress of the Sky,» comes a voice. It's Lasat Axe of Gold, in the company of Chief Steward Daringos. He glances towards the Marquee. «Qualifying round? Best of luck. My fighter, Elupus, doesn't have to qualify, of course.»</p>
   <p>I'm surprised at the pettiness of this. For the nation's top Sorcerer, Lasat never misses an opportunity to make some footling criticism.</p>
   <p>«Elupus is a strong favourite,» continues Lasat. «What do the bookmakers have to say about your young lady?»</p>
   <p>«Nothing,» I say, muscling my way into the conversation. «Which is unfortunate for them, because we're cleaning up when Makri wins the tournament.»</p>
   <p>«Really? What say you, Lisutaris, to a small bet on whose fighter progresses furthest?»</p>
   <p>«I say that's a good idea,» replies Lisutaris, rising to the bait. With so many Barons looking on, it would be difficult not to.</p>
   <p>«Say five thousand gurans?»</p>
   <p>I blink. That's a lot of money when you don't have any.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris doesn't blink. «Only five thousand? I thought you were confident. Let's make it ten.»</p>
   <p>Lasat is taken aback, though he does his best not to show it. «Ten thousand? Very well. To whoever goes furthest in the tournament.»</p>
   <p>Lasat bids us farewell, and departs with a smile on his face. Throughout all this Makri has shown no sign of emotion. Kublinos, however, is very concerned.</p>
   <p>«Ten thousand gurans? I don't mean to be rude…»</p>
   <p>He casts a glance towards Makri. «But are you certain about this?'</p>
   <p>„Quite certain,“ declares Lisutaris. „Lasat Axe of Gold is not going to intimidate me. Makri will be victorious. Thraxas, I have a small matter I need to discuss with you.“</p>
   <p>Lisutaris draws me aside, out of earshot. „Thraxas, find me a quiet space where I can inhale some thazis.“</p>
   <p>„Here? It's risky.“</p>
   <p>„Not as risky as me lighting up a stick in full view of everyone. Which I will do in about fifteen seconds if you don't find me somewhere private. Do you realise I just bet ten thousand gurans?“</p>
   <p>„I thought you carried it off well, in the circumstances.“</p>
   <p>„I don't have any money! What if Makri loses?“</p>
   <p>„We could flee. Fleeing from gambling debts isn't so bad, I've done it a few times.“</p>
   <p>„Really?“</p>
   <p>„Yes, it's quite an established tradition.“</p>
   <p>By now I've led us to a quiet spot beside one of the small huts used as changing rooms. We slip inside. Lisutaris takes out a thazis stick and snaps her fingers. Her magical power really is considerable. I doubt if any other Sorcerer in the world could simultaneously cast spells to lock the door, light a thazis stick and erase the smell of smoke with one hand, while rolling another stick with the other. „If Makri loses I'll probably have to marry Kublinos. He's got a lot of money. I didn't really notice he was attracted to me till Makri pointed it out.“ She pauses. „Strange really. Men aren't often attracted to me.“</p>
   <p>The hairs on the back of my neck tingle. I have an uncanny sense of when a woman is about to say something concerning romance, emotion and affairs of the heart, none of which I want to talk about.</p>
   <p>„Why do you think that is?“ says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>„Probably just put off by your position. You know, Head of the Sorcerers Guild. It can be intimidating.“</p>
   <p>Lisutaris isn't convinced. „I don't think it's that intimidating.“</p>
   <p>„Well there's probably some other simple explanation,“ I hazard.</p>
   <p>„I'm not attractive? Is that what you're saying?“</p>
   <p>„I didn't say that at all.“</p>
   <p>„There's no real need to say it, is there? I mean, face facts. Men simply regard me as unattractive.“</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks so unhappy I'm worried she might burst into tears, something I'm completely unable to cope with.</p>
   <p>„Could we stop having this conversation?“ I say, desperately. „We have to get back to Makri.“</p>
   <p>„Of course, you can't last five minutes without Makri,“ says Lisutaris. „It's obviously tedious spending any time in my company. You're wasting your time you know, Thraxas. A beautiful young woman like Makri is never going to go for you, no matter how much you keep trying to seduce her.“</p>
   <p>„I've never tried to seduce Makri,“ I protest.</p>
   <p>„I suppose <emphasis>seduce</emphasis> is the wrong word. More like skulking around the Queen's Bathing House, hoping to see her naked again. I tell you Thraxas, it looks bad for a man of your age. People are starting to notice.“</p>
   <p>„What people?“</p>
   <p>„Many people. Your relentless pursuit of Makri is the talk of the Baroness's swimming group.“</p>
   <p>„I refuse to continue this conversation.“</p>
   <p>„Hah.“ Lisutaris smokes the rest of her thazis in gloomy silence. I think her moods are becoming worse. I've no idea why. I suppose the prospect of abject humiliation in front of her peers might have something to do with it.</p>
   <p>„I need to speak to the King's Chief Steward, Daringos,“ I say. „Could you arrange that for me?“</p>
   <p>„I suppose so,“ says Lisutaris. Why?»</p>
   <p>«He carried out the original investigation into the death I'm looking into for the Baroness.»</p>
   <p>«I should be able to arrange it. I'll talk to him.»</p>
   <p>When Lisutaris has finished her thazis, I open the door. Somehow it's no surprise to find Kublinos outside, glaring at me suspiciously. Lisutaris walks by him without a word. I try to do likewise but the Sorcerer grabs me by the arm.</p>
   <p>«I'm warning you, Turanian,» he hisses. «I'm not going to stand idly by while you try to take advantage of a fine woman like Lisutaris.»</p>
   <p>I glare back at him. «Let go of my arm or I'll kill you.»</p>
   <p>Kublinos, surprised, lets go. I turn round and walk off, angry at the foolishness of everyone. By now, tournament officials are pinning hastily-prepared signs to the public noticeboards, laying out the schedule for the remainder of the day. Makri, being in the final qualifying group, will only have one fight this evening, and will have to complete her group tomorrow. It's a minor inconvenience, nothing more. Makri appears completely relaxed as she departs with Lisutaris to change into her armour. General Hemistos, Baron Girimos and several others are still around. When I see Baron Mabados approaching I withdraw into the crowd, not feeling like dealing with another unfriendly Samsarinan at this moment.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Fifteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Makri's visor covers her face. Tournament rules state that all entrants must be fully armoured. As well as the helmet, Makri is wearing a metal gorget to protect her neck, and a thick steel breastplate. Her leggings are covered in chainmail, with steel plates hanging over her thighs, and there are more metal plates on her upper arms and forearms. It's all much heavier than the armour Makri would normally wear. I hope she's adapted to it. I'm not sure how often she's worn it for practice.</p>
   <p>I make my way to her side and escort her into the tournament field. The field is roughly circular, with banks of wooden seats set up for spectators, making it into a temporary arena. There's a good crowd. While excitement during the early rounds is not exactly fevered, everyone is eager to see if there might be any new talents coming through. In the centre of the field, the presiding Marshal, in his distinctive red costume, checks her equipment. He studies the edge of her sword, making sure it's properly blunted, then examines her shield, checking that the rim hasn't been illegally sharpened. He glances at her armour. The Marshal is meant to ensure that no one's armour is deficient in any way, but in truth his examination is quite perfunctory. While the organisers do make a public display of protecting fighters' safety, the general feeling is that you enter at your own peril. If your helmet is so poorly made that it shatters under the impact of a sword, that's your problem.</p>
   <p>The Marshal checks Makri's opponent. I couldn't find out much about him, other than his name is Parasas, and he's from Nioj, which is unusual. Niojans don't go in for tournament fighting, as a rule. He stares at Makri. Makri stares back at him. His manager stares at me. I stare back at his manager. The Marshal waves us back and we retreat, leaving our fighters behind us. Lisutaris is waiting for me at the edge of the field. Behind her are several Barons, two ambassadors, some Sorcerers, and General Hemistos, all here to see how Makri performs.</p>
   <p>On the northern edge of the field there's a small wooden tower, another temporary construction. Sitting at the top is Markinos Moonstone, tournament Sorcerer. It's his responsibility to ensure that no one cheats by using magic. It's not unknown for Sorcerers to influence fights by boosting a combatant's abilities, particularly if there's a lot of gambling involved. A competent tournament Sorcerer should be able to detect and prevent this. I've no idea how competent Markinos is. Lisutaris thinks he's probably honest, though she has little regard for his abilities.</p>
   <p>There are few formalities. The Marshal has a staff with a small yellow pennant. He raises it, then brings it down, starting the fight. Makri and Parasas approach each other. Each has their sword in their right hand and a small, round shield in their left. I don't like the way Makri carries her shield. It looks too casual. Parasas lunges in first. Makri easily blocks his blow, and counters immediately. I'm half-expecting her to land a lethal stoke, such is her speed, but Parasas blocks in turn. He's fast. Quite talented as well I'd say, from the way he next attacks. Makri blocks his sword but he hits her with his shield. Makri is knocked backwards. She thrusts with her sword but it passes over Parasas shoulder. He advances very quickly. To my surprise, Makri loses her footing, something she would never normally do. Parasas swings a blow at her neck, which connects, making a loud clanging noise. Fighters are not meant to deal mortal blows, but no one holds back much, and it's a powerful strike. The crowd roars. Makri stumbles backwards. The Marshal leaps in-between the fighters, raising his staff.</p>
   <p>«Lethal Stroke!» he cries. The fight is over. Makri has lost.</p>
   <p>I set off at a run, worried in case the blow has wounded Makri. By the time I reach the centre of the field, Makri is on her feet, shouting at the Marshal.</p>
   <p>«What do you mean I lost? I didn't lose! You didn't count my blow to his neck!»</p>
   <p>«You didn't hit his neck,» says the Marshal.</p>
   <p>«I did! You're just too slow to see it.»</p>
   <p>«You missed!»</p>
   <p>«I didn't miss! And something made me lose my footing! I've been cheated!»</p>
   <p>Makri is furious. I know there's no point arguing. The Marshal isn't going to change his mind. Even if she did get in a strike which the Marshal didn't see, she still suffered a knockdown, and a very obvious hit to the neck. It was a poor performance. As I escort Makri from the field, she's still complaining furiously.</p>
   <p>«Something grabbed my ankle! Someone must have used a spell against me.»</p>
   <p>I didn't feel any sorcery in the arena. Neither did Markinos Moonstone, or he'd have called it. We come to a halt beside Lisutaris. The Sorceress is very pale, probably imagining the financial catastrophe that threatens to engulf her.</p>
   <p>«Are you all right?» she asks.</p>
   <p>«Yes. I'm sorry I lost.»</p>
   <p>«Bad luck,» says General Hemistos. Behind the General, Baron Mabados, Lasat, Charius and several others are making no attempt to hide their amusement. Lisutaris's much-vaunted bodyguard, claimed by the Sorceress to be a champion gladiator, has lost her first fight to an unknown outsider. Makri is seething with fury and humiliation. «The next fight will be different,» she says.</p>
   <p>Makri walks off. Lisutaris and I follow her. We walk as quickly as we can back to Lisutaris's carriage. I ask Lisutaris if she sensed any sorcery in the arena. She shakes her head. The three of us clamber into the two-person carriage. I take the reins. As we ride off, I can feel my own anger rising. I've lost my bet on Makri winning her fight, and we have no money in reserve. I knew she didn't prepare properly. I decide to give her a piece of my mind.</p>
   <p>«Well that was a waste of time,» I say, by way of getting started. «You»</p>
   <p>I don't make it any further. Makri bursts into tears. It's a shocking sight, both for myself and Lisutaris. We ride home in silence, save for Makri's sobs, which go on for a long time. I try and think of something comforting to say, but nothing comes. Makri, champion gladiator of the Orcish lands, undefeated in combat since she appeared in the West, has just lost her first fight in a tournament, and nothing I say is going to make that better.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Sixteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I don't have much time to dwell on our misfortune because I've arranged to visit Baroness Demelzos's residence to give her an update. That's not to say I'm not thinking some depressing thoughts as I walk through the town. Makri's unexpected defeat has destroyed my betting strategy. I still have my wager on her winning the tournament, but I've no money to bet on each individual match. Makri has to fight four more times. I'm still confident she can beat her next opponents, but it's going to leave a sour taste in my mouth if I can't get a bet down.</p>
   <p>As for Arichdamis's missing plans, that's another problem we haven't even begun to deal with. Lisutaris firmly believes that Lasat took them and intends to use them to embarrass her. She's probably right, but we can't decide what to do about it. We can't openly accuse him of theft. I'd consider burgling his mansion and searching for them, but a powerful Sorcerer like Lasat has plenty of defensive spells to deter burglars.</p>
   <p>A female servant opens the door and leads me to the Baroness. Demelzos is suitably attired for receiving visitors, which means she's wearing a robe and jewellery that cost more than my yearly income. She rises to greet me.</p>
   <p>«You're late.»</p>
   <p>«I was busy at the tournament.»</p>
   <p>She doesn't ask me how it went, which is a relief.</p>
   <p>«My family has an invitation to dine with Baron Vosanos tomorrow,» she tells me.</p>
   <p>I look at her blankly.</p>
   <p>«My daughter refuses to attend. It's a serious embarrassment. Have you cleared things up?»</p>
   <p>«That depends on what you mean by <emphasis>cleared things up</emphasis>.»</p>
   <p>«Can you convince Merlione that her friend wasn't murdered? And that she has no reason to worry?»</p>
   <p>«Is that what you're expecting?»</p>
   <p>«It's what I'm hoping for,» says the Baroness.</p>
   <p>I notice a tempting bottle of wine on the table. The Baroness hasn't offered me any. Perhaps that's beneath her.</p>
   <p>«I think it's quite possible that Alceten was murdered. That might mean your daughter does have reason to worry.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos looks aghast. «Surely you're not serious?»</p>
   <p>«I talked to people at the Royal Record House and I'm not convinced they're telling the truth. I think they've been got at, to keep quiet. Persuaded, or bribed.»</p>
   <p>«Do you have proof of that?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«Any sort of evidence?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«So I'm to allow my family to descend into chaos because you have some vague suspicion?»</p>
   <p>I shrug. «You don't have to allow anything. It's up to you. But you asked me to find out if there was any truth in Merlione's suspicions, and I think there might be.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos sits down, very troubled. «What can I possibly tell my husband?»</p>
   <p>«I take it he doesn't know you hired me?»</p>
   <p>«No. And he's not going to be pleased to learn.» The Baroness shakes her head. «Thraxas, are you really sure about this? If Merlione's in danger, then I have to protect her, but it's going to cause an awful lot of trouble.»</p>
   <p>«I think there was something suspicious about Alceten's death. Whether that means Merlione's in danger too, I can't say for sure. It might have nothing to do with your daughter. She might just have arrived there at the wrong time. But your daughter did think the carriage was trying to run her down as well, so I'd say you should take the threat seriously.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos reaches out, picks up the bottle, and fills two silver goblets with wine. She passes one to me. «What do I do now?»</p>
   <p>«Keep Merlione safe and out of sight while I do some more investigating.»</p>
   <p>«What if you can't find out anything?»</p>
   <p>«I will,» I say, and finish my wine quickly. «I'll need to talk to Alceten's father. I understand he's an important official.»</p>
   <p>«Cetenos? He is fairly important, I suppose.»</p>
   <p>«Would you give me a letter of introduction? It will make my life easier.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness hesitates. «If I do that, everyone will soon know I've hired you to investigate.»</p>
   <p>«Is that a problem?»</p>
   <p>«The King's Chief Steward already made enquiries. Me hiring you is like telling everyone I don't trust him.»</p>
   <p>«He's going to know that soon enough anyway, because I'll be talking to him too.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness's brow creases with worry.</p>
   <p>«I could get by without the letter of introduction.»</p>
   <p>Baroness Demelzos thinks for a moment. «I'm not having my daughter's life put in danger for fear of a scandal.» She claps her hands and a servant hurries into the room. «Bring writing materials,» she says. «And my official seal.»</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Returning to Arichdamis's house with Demelzos's letter of introduction in my pocket, I pass the Jolly Bandit, an attractive-looking tavern with light and music spilling from the shutters. Minstrels are playing a lusty drinking song. I can hear the crowd banging their tankards as they join in with the chorus. I sigh. There's nothing I'd like better than to join in with a drinking song, and get a few ales inside me. Unfortunately, I don't have a guran to my name. I shake my head at the injustice of it, and carry on slowly up the road. I'm in no hurry to get home. Arichdamis has been miserable since his plans went missing, and Lisutaris is no better. I hope Makri has stopped crying.</p>
   <p>«Damn it,» I say out loud. «Not crying was one of her only good points. What am I meant to say to her now?»</p>
   <p>Makri knows I can't cope with women crying. We've discussed it. It wouldn't surprise me if Lisutaris has joined in. She's been as miserable as a Niojan whore all day. I'm slightly heartened by the thought of Arichdamis's cellars. They've been severely depleted since I moved in, but I can probably find a pie or two down there, and a bottle of Elvish wine. With luck, I can sneak them off to my room without encountering anyone.</p>
   <p>«Maybe it won't be so bad,» I mutter, fumbling with my key in the unfamiliar lock. «Maybe they've pulled themselves together.»</p>
   <p>I enter the house and practically trip over Lisutaris, who's lying on the floor. Obviously she hasn't pulled herself together. At least she doesn't seem to be crying. The hallway is enveloped in the sort of thick haze that can only be produced by the most determined of thazis smokers.</p>
   <p>«Ah, Thraxas. My Chief Adviser. A Chief Adviser who's full of good advice. Whatever Thraxas advises, you'd best do it. He is my Chief Adviser, after all.»</p>
   <p>«Is something wrong?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris drags herself into a sitting position. «I'm being mocked on all sides and I'm about to become the poorest woman in the West. Apart from that, everything's fine.»</p>
   <p>«Makri can recover. She's not out of the tournament yet.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shakes her head. «Help me up.»</p>
   <p>I take hold of Lisutaris by her shoulders and drag her to her feet, then help her along to the main guest room where she collapses on a couch.</p>
   <p>«You know, smoking all this thazis isn't helping,» I say.</p>
   <p>«I'm the Head of the Sorcerers Guild. I'll smoke whatever I want.»</p>
   <p>«Where's Makri?»</p>
   <p>«In the gardens, breaking things with her axe.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris yawns, then closes her eyes. I gaze at her, wondering if it's really such a great idea to have this woman lead our armies against the Orcs. Lasat might be a fool but at least he’s conscious most of the time. Actually, he probably isn’t, not with his dwa habit. Damn these Sorcerers. Can’t they stay sober for five minutes?</p>
   <p>I take my illuminated staff out into the gardens. A familiar smells fills my nostrils. I frown, and follow the aroma till I find Makri, prostrate on the grass. The dragon is curled up beside her, sleeping. On the ground beside Makri there's a cheap tin box with a hole on top, blackened by flames. It's the sort of device you use to burn and inhale dwa. I'm appalled at the discovery. I've no idea where she might have procured the drug. It's unbelievably foolish behaviour. Apart from the inherent dangers, it would probably mean execution if the authorities learned of it. If the King doesn't like thazis, that's nothing to what he thinks about the much more powerful dwa.</p>
   <p>I bend down and pick Makri up. The dragon stirs, but doesn't waken. I take her indoors and along to the guest room where I lay her on another couch, next to Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«This is all going to end badly,» I mutter.</p>
   <p>The nights aren't yet warm. I take the thick, embroidered cloth that hangs on the back of each couch and cover both of the slumbering figures. Still carrying my illuminated staff, I head down to the cellars. A brief examination reveals a side of roast beef, a half-round of goat's cheese, and a cask of ale.</p>
   <p>«I'm surrounded by fools,» I say, as I open the cask. «Dragging me down, as always.» I get busy on the beef, the cheese, and the ale, meanwhile cursing my misfortune at being saddled with such useless companions.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Seventeen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I wake with a neck-ache from sleeping on the hard stone floor. I soon discover I have a headache too. As I drag myself upright to negotiate my way out of the gloomy cellar, I clatter into some empty wine bottles. I don't remember drinking wine. Must have seemed like a good idea after the beer. My head is pounding. Even a champion drinker such as myself can suffer the occasional mild hangover from mixing ale and Elvish wine, and I seem to have made a reasonable attempt at emptying Arichdamis's cellars. I need a Lesada leaf. The Elvish plant is highly effective against hangovers. I realise I have a raging thirst. I stumble my way up the rest of the stairs and barge into the kitchen. There's a young cook, busy at the range. Ignoring his protests, I commandeer the bucket of fresh water by his side, drinking freely then ducking my head in the remainder.</p>
   <p>I remember last night's events and realise I'm still angry at Lisutaris and Makri. What a pair. Completely incapable of coping with problems without resorting to intoxication. I find them both still lying on their couches in the guest room.</p>
   <p>«There you are!» I cry. «What have you got to say for yourselves?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris yawns as she wakens. «What are you talking about?»</p>
   <p>«You're completely out of control, Lisutaris. The slightest setback and you immediately» I pause. Suddenly my headache seems a lot worse. I feel nauseous. I sit down very heavily on a vacant couch.</p>
   <p>«Having problems?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Do you have any lesada leaves?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris starts to laugh, but it turns into a fit of coughing.</p>
   <p>«Hypocrite,» she gasps, when the coughing subsides. «You've been emptying the cellars again.»</p>
   <p>«There's nothing wrong with a bit of ale. Have you got a lesada leaf or not? My head is killing me.»</p>
   <p>«At least thazis doesn't give you hangovers,» says Lisutaris, smugly. She raises herself on one elbow. Her face takes on a greenish-tinge, and she lies back down. «I don't feel very well.»</p>
   <p>Makri chooses this moment to wake up. As soon as she does she vomits over the side of the couch.</p>
   <p>«Now I'm feeling worse,» moans Lisutaris. «What's wrong with Makri?»</p>
   <p>«She's been taking dwa.»</p>
   <p>«What?» Lisutaris looks horrified. «Is that true?»</p>
   <p>Makri is sick again. I hope the carpet wasn't too expensive.</p>
   <p>«As soon as I feel better I'm going to be really angry,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Do you have any lesada leaves?»</p>
   <p>«I can't remember. I put all my supplies in my magic purse. There might be some in there.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris starts fumbling around in her purse.</p>
   <p>«Dammit my head is sore,» I moan.</p>
   <p>«You drink too much,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>I'm about to direct some cutting remarks in her direction when Arichdamis appears. He takes in the sight of Lisutaris, Makri and me sprawled on his fine couches, and the mess on the floor.</p>
   <p>«What is the meaning of this?» he demands. «I did not invite you into my house to turn it into a den of hopeless intoxication!»</p>
   <p>Makri is sick again, then falls off the couch. Lisutaris erupts in a terrible outbreak of coughing, ending with her moaning and gasping for breath. Arichdamis gazes at them, appalled.</p>
   <p>«Do you have any lesada leaves?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«No!» barks Arichdamis. «And from what I've seen, I don't have anything left in my cellars either.»</p>
   <p>«I did take a small jug of ale. I'll replace it, of course.»</p>
   <p>The elderly mathematician glares angrily round the room. «I'm very disappointed in all of you. You in particular, Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, ought to know better.» With that, he departs.</p>
   <p>«I don't see why he's blaming me,» mutters Lisutaris. «Thraxas is much worse. Everyone knows that.»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress sticks her hand so far into her purse that her arm disappears. «I can't get used to this new magic pocket, I can never find anything.» She produces a sword, then a spell-book, before finally finding what she's looking for.</p>
   <p>«Lesada leaves. I've had these a long time. I'm not sure if they're still potent.»</p>
   <p>I take two of the leaves, eating one and giving the other to Makri. Lisutaris puts one in her mouth, grimacing at the bitter taste. We lie in silence for a while. The leaves, being old, take a while to work, but I slowly start to feel better.</p>
   <p>«Who'd have thought Arichdamis would be so bad-tempered?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«He'll get over it. Makri can smooth things out by talking about mathematics or something. Do you have a spell for cleaning the carpet?»</p>
   <p>As we recover, I fill Lisutaris and Makri in on my investigation. There was a time when I'd never share details of my work, but these days I'm used to letting Makri know about my cases. As for Lisutaris, we're all in such a tricky situation together I figure it's as well she knows what I'm doing.</p>
   <p>«You're dealing with important people,» says Lisutaris. «Baron Mabados, Baron Girimos, Vosanos, Chief Steward Daringos.»</p>
   <p>«I know. I'll try not to give them any reason to blame you for anything.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris makes a face. She stands up unsteadily, and crosses to the large mirror which hangs in a plain bronze frame above the fireplace.</p>
   <p>«Don't worry about it,» she says. «I'm fed up being discrete. I'm fed up with this Samsarinan hairstyle too.» She unpins her hair, letting it flow untidily around her shoulders. «I'm fed up trying to appease Samsarinans in general. They can like me or not like me. It's time I took control.»</p>
   <p>I share the Sorceress's sentiments. All this worrying about status is getting us nowhere. If I was in Turai, I'd have already been a lot more forceful in my investigation.</p>
   <p>«At the next meeting I'm going to tell the King it's time we elected a War Leader,» says Lisutaris. «And I'm the obvious candidate.»</p>
   <p>«That's probably when Lasat will produce the missing plans,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris loses a little of her newly regained colour, but rallies. «We'll sort that out.»</p>
   <p>«How?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. Thraxas? Any thoughts?»</p>
   <p>«Not at the moment. But I do have something else in mind. The pie eating competition.»</p>
   <p>«Pardon?»</p>
   <p>«You didn't want me to enter because it might be bad for your status. If you're no longer worried about that, I'm entering. We need the money.»</p>
   <p>«Fine,» says Lisutaris. «Enter the competition. We might even be able to turn it into a heroic achievement»</p>
   <p>«I doubt that,» says Makri. «Have you seen Thraxas eat?»</p>
   <p>Makri is due to fight later on in the day. She's determined not to put up such a poor showing again. «I know someone used a spell against me,» she mutters.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris didn't detect any sorcery, but admits she wasn't concentrating fully, as Markinos Moonstone was there. If any hostile magic was used, he should have sensed it.</p>
   <p>«I'll make sure no sorcery is used against you from now on,» promises Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>Makri still insists that she won the fight anyway. «I cut his neck. In a real fight he'd have been dead. Useless judges.»</p>
   <p>She heads out to the gardens, still complaining. Lisutaris has another meeting this evening. She asks me if I want to attend with her. Ambassadors from Nioj have finally arrived. Nioj, Samsarina and Simnia will be providing the bulk of the armies in the upcoming war. Many smaller states will lend support, but the only other really large ally is the Elves. Their ambassadors should be here soon.</p>
   <p>«I thought the Barons didn't want me at their meetings?»</p>
   <p>«They don't,» says Lisutaris. «But I'm taking control. You're my adviser so you should be there. If they don't like it that's their problem. Is there any chance you won't be drunk and unpleasant?»</p>
   <p>«There's always a chance.»</p>
   <p>«If Daringos is there I'll try and arrange for you to speak with him,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>After breakfasting on a loaf of bread and the last smoked ham in the cellar, I make my way back to the King's Record House to speak to Cetenos, father of the unfortunate Alceten. I'm carrying Baroness Demelzos's letter of introduction. The same two soldiers are on guard, and this time they don't ignore me. They're inquisitive about my business, and not friendly. Obviously someone's been talking about me. I tell them I'm here to talk to Cetenos.</p>
   <p>«The King's Record Keeper doesn't talk to visitors.»</p>
   <p>«He'll talk to me,» I reply. «Not that you have any reason to prevent me from entering.»</p>
   <p>One of the soldiers laughs. «Let him in. Zinlantol will throw him out anyway.»</p>
   <p>Zinlantol is sitting behind her desk. She starts her hostile glare while I'm still some distance away, and keeps it up.</p>
   <p>«I'm here to talk to Cetenos.»</p>
   <p>«He's not available.»</p>
   <p>«My letter of introduction from Baroness Demelzos says otherwise.» I waste no time brandishing it. Zinlantol takes it as quite a blow. After studying the official seal she reluctantly admits to herself that it's genuine. She rises from her chair, and speaks to a young assistant.</p>
   <p>«Tell Cetenos there's someone here to see him. An investigator from Turai, with an introduction from Baroness Demelzos, if you can believe it.»</p>
   <p>I wait a long time while Zinlantol pointedly ignores me. Behind her are rows and rows of shelving, full of books and scrolls. Next to the shelves are cabinets, wood darkened with age. As I watch, an assistants arrives with a box and starts loading papers into one of the cabinets.</p>
   <p>«What are they?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«Mining records,» mutters Zinlantol. «Please don't interrupt, I'm busy.»</p>
   <p>Eventually the first assistant arrives back and beckons for me to follow him. He leads me through several dimly-lit rooms full of dusty books and scrolls, up a winding staircase, though more rooms, and finally into something which might pass as a private reception room, were it not also full of boxes of papers, some of them obviously still waiting to be organised. I take a seat, and wait. For something to do I try reading a few of the documents on the table beside me, but they're all about productivity levels at a silver mine, and my eyes glaze over.</p>
   <p>Cetenos turns out to be older than I was expecting. He must have married late. He's using a walking stick as he shuffles slowly into the room. His hair is thin and grey, but longer than I'd expect for a Samsarinan government official. His cuffs are frayed, and his boots, once smart, are scuffed and worn. He looks like a man who's not much interested in his appearance any more. As I rise to greet him he stands motionless, staring at me, weighing me up in silence. I take out Demelzos's letter.</p>
   <p>«The Baroness requests that you talk to me.»</p>
   <p>He glances at the letter. «You're asking questions about Alceten?»</p>
   <p>«That's right.»</p>
   <p>The elderly man's arm starts to tremble, and so does his cane. It's a relief when he makes it to a chair safely.</p>
   <p>«Her death was a terrible shock,» he says. «The pain of it has almost…» His voice tails off.</p>
   <p>«When did you last see her?»</p>
   <p>«Minutes before it happened. She was here, in this room. But why are you asking about this?»</p>
   <p>«I'm just trying to clear up a few details.»</p>
   <p>Cetenos, while distressed, hasn't lost his wits. «Is there some suggestion that my daughter's death wasn't an accident?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. But if you repeat that to anyone it will make it harder for me to investigate.»</p>
   <p>«How could it not have been an accident? No one would have wanted to harm Alceten.»</p>
   <p>«Could you tell me what she was doing that day, just before she left the building?»</p>
   <p>«She was in here, sorting out records.»</p>
   <p>«What records?»</p>
   <p>«I'm not certain. Alceten had taken over a lot of my work.» He waves his hand, indicating the jumble of shelves and boxes. «We have so much here…»</p>
   <p>«What sort of records do you keep in this building?»</p>
   <p>«Everything. Crop yields, taxation, mining rights, import duties, family records, births, amendments to laws — it's the main repository for all official business.»</p>
   <p>«But you can't say what she was doing?»</p>
   <p>Cetenos puts his hand to his forehead, and sighs, as if even thinking of his daughter is too much to bear.</p>
   <p>«I'm really not sure. Mining rights, probably. There are always a lot of claims being filed. They have to be checked with existing claims, and double checked with with our records of statutes and inheritances, to make sure the rights don't already belong to someone else.»</p>
   <p>«Was you daughter the only one working here?»</p>
   <p>«In this room, yes.»</p>
   <p>«Did she indicate to you that she'd found anything strange? Some financial transaction someone didn't want made public, for instance?»</p>
   <p>«No, she never said anything like that. Really, this all sounds unlikely. Didn't Chief Steward Daringos investigate the accident?»</p>
   <p>«He did. I'm not sure how thorough he was.»</p>
   <p>I talk to Cetenos for a while longer, without discovering anything that seems significant.</p>
   <p>«When she met Merlione, was it always outside this building?»</p>
   <p>«I'm not sure. I think they used to exchange messages, making their arrangements.»</p>
   <p>«So someone might have learned when they were due to meet?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. But why are you asking about Merlione?»</p>
   <p>«Just filling in some details.»</p>
   <p>Being surrounded by so many dusty books and scrolls is making me thirsty. I rise from my chair. As I leave the building, I'm no less inclined to believe that Alceten may have been murdered. Wills, financial transactions and trading agreements have led to plenty of deaths in the past. It's unfortunate her father couldn't tell me what she was working on. I make a few more enquires downstairs, with several young assistants, but they lead nowhere. None of them know what Alceten might have been working on before she died. Whether they're telling the truth, or have clammed up like Zinlantol, I'm not certain.</p>
   <p>Thirsty as I am, I have no money for beer, and that's a bitter thing for a man to admit, particularly a man who's served his country bravely, and worked hard to make his city a better place. Forty-five years old and not enough money for a tankard of ale. At least there's the eating contest to look forward to. I'm heartened by the thought that's it's standard for such events to provide their contestants with a plentiful supply of ale, but my hopes are quickly dashed by the Master of Ceremonies.</p>
   <p>«No beer? Are you serious?»</p>
   <p>«We supply as much water as required.»</p>
   <p>«Water? You expect a champion eater to manage with water? What sort of cheap competition is this anyway? There's something far wrong in the nation of Samsarina if you can't give a man beer when he's eating. We'd never have stood for it back in Turai.»</p>
   <p>«Then maybe you should go back to Turai,» says the Master of Ceremonies.</p>
   <p>«I would, if you Samsarinans would stop dallying around and get yourself organised. I tell you»</p>
   <p>I'm interrupted by a tap on the shoulder. Makri and Lisutaris have arrived.</p>
   <p>«What are you doing here?»</p>
   <p>«We came to support you,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Just in time to prevent you causing an international incident, it seems,» says Lisutaris. «I'd tone down the insults about Samsarina, while we're actually in Samsarina.»</p>
   <p>«But did you hear that man? No beer! In a pie eating contest! It's ludicrous. I need beer.»</p>
   <p>«Did you ever consider you might have a problem?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«What problem?»</p>
   <p>«You're addicted to beer.»</p>
   <p>«Addicted to beer? There's no such thing.»</p>
   <p>«Yes there is.»</p>
   <p>«Name me one respected doctor who's ever said that drinking too much beer is a problem.»</p>
   <p>«They all say that.»</p>
   <p>«Absolute nonsense. A spot of ale is good for a man. You'd be a lot better off if you took a tankard every now and then. Less skinny, for one thing. Probably better tempered too.»</p>
   <p>«I have a few quarter-gurans,» says Lisutaris, fishing awkwardly in her magic purse. «Here, you'd better hurry.»</p>
   <p>I rush outside for a beer, arriving back just in time to hear the announcement for the start of the contest. The walls of the tent have been rolled up, allowing a large crowd of spectators to look in, and there are shouts of encouragement to various crowd favourites. The Master of Ceremonies rings a bell and a troupe of serving girls appear, each carry a tray brimming with pies. Beef pies, I'm given to understand. Should be reasonable quality, given the amount of farmland there is here. The serving girls begin to distribute the pies. I suddenly feel achingly hungry. I haven't really made up for all that starvation on the boat.</p>
   <p>When everyone has a large pie on the table in front of him, there's a brief, expectant silence. Then, at the command, we fall to eating. I demolish half my pie in one or two bites, take a sip of water, finish the pie, and roar for another. The nearest serving girl slams one onto my plate. Again, I finish it very quickly.</p>
   <p>«What's going on here?» I cry, looking at my empty place. «Is there a shortage of pies?»</p>
   <p>The servant hurries to put another pie in front of me. By now I've settled into a comfortable eating groove. The pies, while not the absolute finest quality, are quite acceptable — tasty beef, crisp pastry, and a reasonable ratio of gravy. I finish a third and a fourth and keep on going. The servants with trays are running around in all directions, and there's an occasional delay of a few seconds before I get my next pie, which I find annoying. There's still a lot of shouting going on but I ignore it, and keep on eating. I have a vague impression of the person next to me moaning in discomfort but I don't let it distract me.</p>
   <p>As I'm yelling for another pie a bell rings. I bang my fist on the table and shout louder, to drown it out. «Where's my next pie? What's the delay? You call this a fair contest?» Suddenly I notice Makri standing in front of me. «Did you bring me a pie?»</p>
   <p>«No. The contest is over.»</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«You won.»</p>
   <p>I notice everyone is looking at me. I feel a tinge of disappointment. «So they're not giving me any more pies?»</p>
   <p>The Master of Ceremonies approaches. «Ladies and gentlemen,» he cries, lifting up my arm. «We have a winner. Nine pies completed! Saxarth of Turai!»</p>
   <p>There's a lot of cheering. I stand up and take a bow. A few of my fellow competitors are looking unwell. Several are slumped over their tables. The Master of Ceremonies hands me fifty gurans.</p>
   <p>«Let's hear it for a mighty eater!» he shouts. To be fair to the Samsarinans, they do give me a decent round of applause. I'm feeling rather pleased with myself as I leave the tent in the company of Makri and Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«You see that? Thraxas, number one chariot at eating pies. No problem whatsoever. I could have eaten more.»</p>
   <p>«You tried to,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«I still have a few corners to fill. As pies go, they weren't that big.»</p>
   <p>«Your nearest competitor only managed six.»</p>
   <p>«Lightweights. Well, I hope you both take note of this. While you're flailing around, I get the job done.»</p>
   <p>«What does that mean?» demands Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«It means that while certain members of our party crumble at the first sign of pressure, ending up half-killing themselves with thazis, and others stumble about like a child with a toy sword, losing their first fight and going home in tears, I, Thraxas of Turai, simply approach a difficult task in a determined manner, and complete the deal. Nine pies eaten, competitors snivelling in the dust, and we've earned fifty gurans. Let this be an inspiration to you.»</p>
   <p>«You're a fantastic inspiration,» says Lisutaris, dryly. «I'll certainly never forget the sight of you wolfing down these pies.»</p>
   <p>«Greetings, Lisutaris,» comes a familiar, unwelcome voice. It's Lasat Axe of Gold, who, along with his sidekick Charius, seems to be haunting the place. «Is it true that your Chief Adviser has just taken first place in a pie eating contest?»</p>
   <p>«It is,» says Lisutaris, stiffly.</p>
   <p>«Really? That will make an amusing story for the King…»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky, draws herself up to her full height. Her cloak, elegant dark blue with the Sorcerer's rainbow motif embroidered around the edge, flutters regally in the breeze.</p>
   <p>«Pie-eating is an honourable occupation where I come from. I'm proud of my Chief Adviser's endeavours.»</p>
   <p>«Really?» Lasat smirks. «I wouldn't allow a member of my staff to participate.»</p>
   <p>«What you would or would not allow is of no consequence to me. Thraxas's mighty appetite has often been the precursor to some of his most brilliant advice. Come, Thraxas, and Makri. It's time to prepare for the sword-fighting competition.» With that, Lisutaris sweeps away, head held high. We follow on.</p>
   <p>«Thanks for the support,» I say.</p>
   <p>«You're welcome. If you do actually meet the king, try not to mention the pie-eating. Makri, are you ready to fight?»</p>
   <p>Makri nods. She has an extremely determined glint in her eyes. Her group will finish today, which means she'll have four fights in quick succession. That's a tough schedule. I leave them on their way to the changing room, while I hurry off to the bookmakers to place the fifty gurans I won.</p>

   <title>
    <p><strong>Chapter Eighteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>On my way to the bookmaker's tent I run into my old companion Combius of Juval. He greets me far less jovially than previously.</p>
   <p>«Well Thraxas, you really landed me in it.»</p>
   <p>«What did I do?»</p>
   <p>«You convinced me with your idiotic talk of that young girl being able to fight. I put money on her.»</p>
   <p>«Ah. Sorry about that.»</p>
   <p>«Why did you say she could fight? Now I'm the laughing-stock of the Armourers Guild.»</p>
   <p>Combius looks hurt. For a sword-fighter, he always did have a sensitive side.</p>
   <p>«Makri <emphasis>can</emphasis> fight. She's due back on the field any time now. I'm here to bet on her again. So should you, to make up your losses.»</p>
   <p>«Are you joking? My wife tallies up my accounts. It's already going to be hard to explain.»</p>
   <p>«Your wife isn't a betting woman?»</p>
   <p>«Not on hopeless long shots, no.»</p>
   <p>I lay my arm ion his shoulder. «Combius, there's a time when a man has to make a stand for what he believes in. Only minutes ago I was engaged in some serious competition, and I didn't flinch. Anyway, you can make up your losses on Makri's next fight.»</p>
   <p>«But what if she loses again?»</p>
   <p>«I've got a hard-won fifty gurans here that says she won't.»</p>
   <p>Big Bixo greets me like an old friend. «Come to try your luck again?»</p>
   <p>I'd planned to bet my whole fifty gurans on Makri winning her next fight, but I notice that her odds for winning the tournament have gone out to two hundred to one. Having seen her first fight, the bookmakers give her no chance at all. I place ten gurans on this, and put my remaining forty on her winning her second fight. Bixo gives me six to one. Makri's opponent is a very strong favourite, at one to ten. As an experienced bookmaker, Big Bixo isn't about to mock anyone who's giving him money, but even so, I can tell he thinks I'm wasting mine. So do several others nearby. As Combius steps up after me, there's some barely suppressed derision.</p>
   <p>«Now it's not just the Armourers Guild laughing at me,» he complains as we leave the tent. «There were leather-workers in there. They're a snide lot at the best of times. I'll never live this down.»</p>
   <p>«Relax. Makri is a shoo-in.»</p>
   <p>«I'm sure some silversmiths were laughing as well.»</p>
   <p>I turn to my old friend. «Combius, what happened to you? I remember us charging into battle with one broken spear between us, and you weren't as worried then as you are now.»</p>
   <p>«I wasn't married then.»</p>
   <p>«Put your mind at rest. You're in for a sudden windfall.»</p>
   <p>Next to the tournament field I manage to grab a private word with Lisutaris while Makri is preparing.</p>
   <p>«Has Makri been taking anything she shouldn't have?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«Are you sure?»</p>
   <p>«Reasonably. How did she get that dwa anyway?»</p>
   <p>«She claims it was just a fragment she brought from Turai, and that was the last of it.»</p>
   <p>«Surely she couldn't find any more in Samsarina?» says Lisutaris. «Look how strict they are about thazis.»</p>
   <p>«Dwa's spread just about everywhere. It will be here all right, if you look hard enough.»</p>
   <p>Makri emerges from her changing room, clad in her armour. Behind us, someone laughs. It's Charius the Wise.</p>
   <p>«At least it covers her ears,» he says. «Mistress of the Sky, if you had to employ an Orc, shouldn't it at least have been a tough one?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris doesn't deign to reply, choosing instead to accompany me to the edge of the arena. I'm the only one allowed to accompany Makri into the fighting area, but Lisutaris has decided to remain as close as possible.</p>
   <p>«All set, Makri?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«I'm ready.»</p>
   <p>«If you need inspiration, just remember the way I tackled these pies.»</p>
   <p>There are a few catcalls as Makri enters the arena, though I do hear one encouraging voice. General Hemistos, in the front row, apparently hasn't lost faith in her.</p>
   <p>Makri's opponent, a Simnian by the name of Zetorex, turns out to be an extremely large man. There's something of a comic mismatch as they square up to each other. Before he drops his helmet over his shaven head there's an expression in his eyes that suggests he's insulted to be faced with such a puny opponent. The Marshal, brightly dressed in red, raises his flag. I walk swiftly back to the edge of the small field. As I turn to watch, the Marshal signals for the fight to begin. Zetorex leaps forward to attack. Makri catches his blade on hers, and uses his momentum to spin him completely round so he ends up facing in the opposite direction. It's the sort of fancy defensive move you might see attempted in practice, but one that would never work that well in real life. Except, that is, when Makri does it. Three seconds into the fight, Zetorex is facing the wrong way and the tip of Makri's sword is touching the back of his neck. That counts as a lethal stroke, and and the Marshal signals she's the winner.</p>
   <p>There's some applause from the crowd, and some surprised laughter. So fast was the fight, and so unexpected the ending, that most people assume it was an accident.</p>
   <p>«She got lucky,» says one spectator beside me, and his neighbour agrees.</p>
   <p>Makri sheathes her sword and walks calmly back towards us. Lisutaris and I congratulate her.</p>
   <p>«You'll be fighting again soon,» I tell her. «Get some rest while I hurry back to Big Bixo's.»</p>
   <p>«Are we winning now?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Things are looking up. We picked up two hundred and forty gurans on that fight. With the original stake, we've got two hundred and eighty. I'm planning to put it all on Makri again.»</p>
   <p>Leaving Makri in Lisutaris's care, I hurry off to do just that. A bird is singing in a tree at the edge of the fields. It suits my mood, which is better than it's been for a while. Nothing like a successful wager for brightening the spirits. Big Bixo hands over my winnings with a sullen look on his face. I study the odds chalked up on the board. Makri is still an outsider, but not by so much. Bixo is offering five to two on her winning her next fight, and the odds on her qualifying from her group have come down to eight to one. I place two hundred and forty on her to win.</p>
   <p>As it's generally a good idea to spread your bets around if you can, I take a walk down the field to the next bookmaker's tent, where the sign says 'Generous Ges, the Gambler's Friend.' Generous Ges is offering the same odds as Big Bixo. I place my remaining forty gurans on Makri to qualify from her group at eight to one, then hurry back to the arena. On the way I meet Combius, who's celebrating with a flagon of ale.</p>
   <p>«Happy now?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«Yes. Should I bet on her again?»</p>
   <p>«Definitely.»</p>
   <p>I return in time to see Parasas, the swordsman who defeated Makri, fighting again. I have to admire his technique as he puts away his next opponent. Makri glowers at him all the way through.</p>
   <p>«How could I lose to him?» she demands. «Not that I did anyway. I was cheated.»</p>
   <p>The crowd has grown. It's a noisy scene, with the clash of weapons, the babble of voices, and music from travelling musicians. Makri's second fight of the day lasts only slightly longer than her first. She attacks from the start. Her opponent parries her first blow and doesn't see the second coming. Makri plants her sword tip at his throat, halting it a fraction of an inch away from him, as required by the rules. The Marshal immediately flags her as the winner. Once again, the crowd is not all that impressed. A bout lasting a few seconds is not what they came here to see. Fights are usually much longer; there can be a great deal of hacking a slashing, with mighty blows landing on shields, before the outcome is decided. Not all fights are ended by a lethal strike. Blows deemed by the Marshal to have landed, but not counting as mortal wounds, are given a half point. A fighter needs four of these half points to win a match, and that's not an uncommon way for a fight to end. A lethal strike has to be performed absolutely perfectly, leaving the Marshal in no doubt that it would have led to death in real combat, before he'll call it. Makri has now done this twice, very quickly. As she retires from the field there's some grumbling.</p>
   <p>«Was that really a killing blow?»</p>
   <p>«I think the Marshal's going easy on her. Damned Orcs.»</p>
   <p>Taking a moment to check that Makri is undamaged, I hurry as fast as I can down to the bookmaker's tent. Not surprisingly, Big Bixo isn't pleased to see me. My two hundred and forty gurans at five to two wins me six hundred. Along with my stake, that means Bixo has to pay me eight hundred and forty gurans, which is more than he has in his till. He has to send one of his assistants off for more cash. When he returns he's flanked by a man I haven't seen before. Younger than Bixo, with a hard, flat face, and scarring round his mouth.</p>
   <p>«Congratulations,» says the hard-faced man, in a voice that's cold even by bookmaker's standards.</p>
   <p>«Who's this?» I ask Bixo.</p>
   <p>«My business partner.»</p>
   <p>Bixo's business partner has a sword glinting at his hip and a poorly concealed dagger under his shirt. I can guess what part of the business he might take care of.</p>
   <p>Naturally, Makri's odds for her next fight, the fourth in her qualifying group, have now fallen drastically, particularly as she's matched against the one fighter whose chances of qualifying were rated worse than hers. Makri is the slight favourite, and Big Bixo is only offering five to six. When I check with Generous Ges, his price is the same. If Ges is actually generous, it doesn't seem to involve giving better odds than the other bookmakers. I keep sixty gurans for expenses and bet the rest, seven hundred and eighty, on Makri to win.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris is in a much better mood after Makri's victories. I find her talking to Kublinos. The Harbour Sorcerer has put on quite a fancy cloak to visit the tournament, and is busy inviting Lisutaris to dinner. He glares at me with loathing as I interrupt, and draw Lisutaris off to one side for a private talk. I take twenty gurans from my purse and hand it to her.</p>
   <p>«What's this?» she asks.</p>
   <p>«Living allowance»</p>
   <p>«Twenty gurans? Are you serious? What am I meant to do with that?»</p>
   <p>«I'm giving the same to Makri. And myself. I need the rest for betting. You want to win big, don't you?»</p>
   <p>The Sorcerer looks at me quite suspiciously. «You have't drunk the rest away, have you?»</p>
   <p>«Is that any way to speak to your Chief Adviser? I've put seven hundred and eighty gurans on Makri to win.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris gazes at the small pile of coins in her hand. «I was hoping to get my hair done. And my nails. And buy a new dress. And shoes.»</p>
   <p>«Can't you manage without all that?»</p>
   <p>«Certainly, if I don't mind going to meet the King looking like a peasant woman fresh from the fields.»</p>
   <p>«Can't you use sorcery?» I suggest. «Conjure up a new dress?»</p>
   <p>«Possibly,» says Lisutaris. «But it's not the same as buying something nice.»</p>
   <p>«Are you going to accept Kublinos's invitation to dinner?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know.»</p>
   <p>«If you do, try and bring some food home. I don't think Arichdamis is going to be restocking his cellars any time soon.»</p>
   <p>It's almost time for Makri's next fight, her third of the day. I lead her into the centre of the field, then take a few steps back to watch her demolish her opponent, which she does, quite rapidly. Makri blocks a few attacks then delivers a flurry of attacking blows, any one of which would probably be fatal. Her opponent ends up flat on his back while the Marshal signals her victory. The crowd enjoy this contest more. It was short, but it did at least contain some violence.</p>
   <p>When I give Makri her twenty gurans she accepts it without complaint, but she does tell me she's not happy with her gorget, which isn't sitting comfortably around her neck. There's no time to do anything about it now, but we can have it altered after she qualifies, which she will do if she wins her next fight.</p>
   <p>«We've got over 1,400 gurans now.»</p>
   <p>«Really?» Makri is impressed, which pleases me.</p>
   <p>«Yes, I'm tormenting the bookmakers. Too much for their liking. There may be trouble if we keep taking their money.»</p>
   <p>Makri touches the pommel of her sword, and smiles. «We can cope with a little trouble from a bookmaker.»</p>
   <p>I smile back at her. We certainly can. I race down to Big Bixo's tent. After three comprehensive victories, Makri's favourite to win her next bout, even though her opponent, Muxilos, is a local man with a lot of support. Bixo is only offering six to four on, or to put it another way, four to six. I keep twenty gurans for beer, and place 1410 on Makri. That will win me nine hundred and forty, which is not too bad. By now, I'm not the only one betting on Makri, and as I leave Bixo's tent, his assistant is busy changing her odds, bringing them down to one to two, which just shows how her reputation has grown over the course of the day. I pick up another beer and drink it while walking back to the arena. While recent events have made it difficult for any loyal Turanian to actually feel as happy as an Elf in a tree, there's a definite spring in my step.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Nineteen</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>By late afternoon, almost every noble in Elath has gathered in the vicinity of the tournament field. Word of Makri's impressive performances has spread. The Barons, either keen on sword-fighting, or keen on gambling, want to see her in action. I notice Mabados in the crowd. I should talk to him as part of my investigation but I've been putting it off. He's not going to be an easy man to interview. Lisutaris, having shaken off Kublinos, is waiting with Makri by the changing rooms.</p>
   <p>«I brought you each a pie,» I say.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks with some disdain at the Samsarinan pastry. «Is it safe to eat?»</p>
   <p>«Of course. I've had ten of them.»</p>
   <p>«I thought you ate nine in the contest?»</p>
   <p>«I was still hungry afterwards.»</p>
   <p>Makri nibbles tentatively at the pastry, a sight I always find frustrating.</p>
   <p>«Just eat the damned thing, you've got to keep up your strength.»</p>
   <p>Considering I have 1,410 gurans staked on her, I'm fairly calm as I lead Makri into the field for her last contest. I'm confident she'll win, although her opponent, Muxilos, has shown some good form. Both fighters need to win to qualify so there's a lot riding on the fight. As the match begins, he keeps himself well covered, evading Makri's initial attack, and then catching her out with a thrust of his shield, knocking her backwards.</p>
   <p>«Makri still isn't good with that shield,» I mutter to Lisutaris. «She's not used to it.»</p>
   <p>Makri rallies quickly, nimbly deflecting Muxilos's blade. She feints to attack and then, demonstrating her unnatural speed, she thrusts her sword towards her opponents throat. I'm on the point of cheering her victory when something odd happens. Makri is visibly jolted, as if by some unseen force. Her blade sails past Muxilos's throat. Makri is now out of position and Muxilos deals her a heavy blow on the shoulder.</p>
   <p>«Half point to Muxilos!» cries the Marshal. The crowd roar.</p>
   <p>«What's going on?» I yell. «They're cheating! Someone's using magic!»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris has risen to her feet, knowing as well as I do that something untoward just happened. She scans the crowd, then looks towards the Tournament Sorcerer on his tower. The fight re-commences. Makri, for no visible reason, loses her footing. She's forced to defend desperately, down on one knee, while Muxilos presses his advantage. She's on the point of regaining her stance when the Marshal stops the fight again.</p>
   <p>«Blow to the ribs!» he cries. «Half point to Muxilos!»</p>
   <p>The crowd erupt. So do I. «There was no blow to the ribs! Cheats! They've bribed the Marshal!»</p>
   <p>Makri is now really up against it. She has two half-points against her, a Marshal who's apparently biased, and a mysterious attack of sorcery to deal with.</p>
   <p>«Do something!» I yell at Lisutaris. She doesn't reply. Her lips are compressed as she scans the crowd. Suddenly there's another great roar. Makri suffers another jolt, freezes for a fraction of a second, and Muxilos's sword comes down on her shoulder again. The Marshal waves his flag, signalling a third-half point. One more and Makri will lose the fight. I yell at Lisutaris again. «Do something!»</p>
   <p>«Stop shouting,» says Lisutaris. «You're not helping.» She turns her left hand palm upwards, clenches her fist, then murmurs something I can't make out. I turn back to the fight, hoping that whatever Lisutaris did, it will end the attacks on Makri. Muxilos, now very confident, moves in quickly. Makri's sword and shield seem to be hanging too low. It's difficult to see exactly what happens next, but Makri, with some combination of sword and leg, sweeps his feet from under him. He crashes to the ground and his helmet flies off. Makri stands over him, her foot pinning down his sword-arm and her own sword at his throat. There's a huge cheer from the crowd. The Marshal looks surprised. It seems to take him forever to make a decision, but really he has no choice.</p>
   <p>«Lethal stroke,» he calls. «Victory to Makri.»</p>
   <p>Immediately the fight ends I sprint towards the Marshal. «What was that about?» I scream. «None of these hits made contact! And there was sorcery! What sort of crooked operation are you running here?»</p>
   <p>The Marshal turns on his heel and walks off without replying. I'm about to pursue him when Lisutaris grabs my collar.</p>
   <p>«We have to go.»</p>
   <p>«Go? We have to sort this out.»</p>
   <p>«We don't have time. We're due at the meeting. I'll have words with the Tournament Sorcerer later. Makri, are you all right?»</p>
   <p>«I'm fine.» Makri winces as she takes off her helmet. She rubs her injured shoulder. «But the sorcery made it difficult. Didn't everyone see it?»</p>
   <p>«It was subtly done,» says Lisutaris. «And it came from a powerful source. It took me a while to deflect it.»</p>
   <p>As always, Makri is wearing a spell-protection necklace, made from Red Elvish Cloth. I wear one exactly the same. They protect us from the worst excesses of sorcery, which probably helped Makri resist the attack as well as she did. General Hemistos is waiting for us at the edge of the field.</p>
   <p>«Fantastic performance Makri!» he enthuses. «Touch and go for a while, but you did it.» The General falls into step with her. «Going to the Ambassadors' meeting? Splendid.»</p>
   <p>Kublinos appears, and sidles his way up to Lisutaris. I find myself walking on my own, while the General and Kublinos do their best to fascinate Makri and Lisutaris. I don't mind. I'm not in the mood for casual conversation. I'm troubled by what just happened. Now that's she's qualified, Makri has a lot of fights ahead of her. She can't afford to lose a single one. The main tournament is a straight knockout competition. The winner goes through to the next round, the loser goes home.</p>
   <p>We pass the Bathing Houses on our way to the Royal Samsarinan Assembly Hall. By this time I'm in the midst of a long, loose straggle of Barons, Sorcerers, Generals and Ambassadors, all making their way to the meeting. It's not officially a War Council, as representatives from all nations aren't here yet, but it might as well be. Important matters of strategy have to be decided. The Orcs have stolen a march on us by taking Turai during the middle of winter. As soon as the roads in the East are passable, more Orcish hordes will be heading out from the Orcish lands to meet up with their leader, Prince Amrag. We've been talking about re-taking Turai, but a more realistic scenario might be the Orcs sweeping their way west before we've even had time to get ourselves organised.</p>
   <p>The Assembly Hall is full of men in dark cloaks. Dignitaries here don't wear togas as they did in Turai. I find that odd. Not fully civilised. There are very few women, the only others apart from Lisutaris and Makri being two senior Sorcerers. There's a lot of milling around, and I notice the Simnian Ambassador deep in conversation with several Niojan diplomats. A delegation from the small nation of Juval has just arrived in Elath, and they've come straight to the Assembly Hall, still dressed in their riding clothes. Lisutaris and Kublinos are engaged in conversation with Barons Vosanos and Girimos. Makri, taking her duties as bodyguard seriously, stays close, silently watchful. I attempt to look like a Special Adviser, though I'm hoping no one asks me for advice, particularly as I'm distracted by the aroma of roasting venison.</p>
   <p>«Is there going to be food?» I ask.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris ignores me but Baron Girimos breaks off the conversation to sniff the air. «Yes! Venison! Excellent. You know, Thraxas, I've been to meetings here where there's been no food at all.»</p>
   <p>«That's just not acceptable. You can't do important business on an empty stomach.»</p>
   <p>«That's what I always say!» cries the Baron.</p>
   <p>I like Baron Girimos. He's a man who cares about the important things in life. I can't say the same for Baron Vosanos, who's irritated at the interruption. Vosanos is a tall, lean man, who has a fancy fur collar on his cloak and a jewelled clasp at the neck, neither of which are quite in keeping with the seriousness of the occasion. I don't know that much about Vosanos, though he did fight in the Orc wars, so he can't be all bad. Baron Mabados approaches with his son Orgodas, who's due to marry Vosanos's daughter. They share a friendly greeting before Mabados turns to me, glares angrily, then asks me if it's true I've been interfering with his household by asking questions and making trouble. Not wanting to reflect badly on Lisutaris, I do my best to answer tactfully.</p>
   <p>«I did have a few minor questions, Baron. Nothing of real importance.»</p>
   <p>«There will be no more questions, minor or otherwise,» announces the Baron. «I'm not having an unwelcome outsider disturbing my family.»</p>
   <p>I remain silent. That doesn't satisfy Mabados.</p>
   <p>«Well?» he demands.</p>
   <p>«Well what?»</p>
   <p>«Are you going to give up this annoying investigation?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>The Baron moves closer. «You Turanians amaze me. Here you are, a bedraggled refugee, a guest in our country, and what do you do? Start bothering important people with your impertinent questions. Really, Lisutaris, have you no control over this man?»</p>
   <p>If it's an uncomfortable moment for Lisutaris, she doesn't let it show. «My Chief Adviser is experienced in investigation. If someone engages him for that reason, I see nothing wrong with it.»</p>
   <p>«What does the death of a woman at the Record House have to do with him? The matter was already investigated.»</p>
   <p>«It's possible that King's Steward Daringos may have overlooked a few details,» I say, still trying to be tactful.</p>
   <p>«What details? It was an accident. And if there were any doubts, it would be for me to pursue the matter, not you. I'm presiding Baron in Elath and I'm ordering you to end this investigation.»</p>
   <p>Baron Vosanos chooses this moment to get involved. «What sort of investigation? Sorcerous? I don't like the idea of foreign Sorcerers poking about, I must say.»</p>
   <p>«I don't use sorcery,» I tell him. Which is almost true. These days magic is mostly beyond me. «I just ask questions.»</p>
   <p>«Then how are your investigations ever successful? Surely criminals don't volunteer information?»</p>
   <p>«I'm dogged. I keep asking.»</p>
   <p>Baron Vosanos laughs. «I can't see you making much progress. Who thinks this girl's death was suspicious anyway? First I've heard of it.»</p>
   <p>«Really? I thought it was well-know there were some suspicions. That's why Daringos was asked to investigate.»</p>
   <p>«There were no suspicions,» says Baron Mabados.</p>
   <p>«That's not what your daughter thinks,» I reply.</p>
   <p>The atmosphere, already cold, drops to somewhere around frozen. Mentioning the Baron's daughter in public, in connection with an investigation, could be construed as a huge social blunder. But I'm fed up being tactful, and maybe it's time to shake things up.</p>
   <p>«If you so much as talk to my daughter I'll run you out of town,» says Mabados.</p>
   <p>«I already talked to her. And you're not running me out of anywhere.»</p>
   <p>«Why, I'll» explodes Mabados, but he's unable to continue as the young King arrives at that moment, heralded by a fanfare of trumpets. Everyone bows respectfully. Out of the corner of my eye, I can see Baron Mabados glaring at me with loathing. Perhaps he knows more than he's letting on.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>King Gardos looks anything but confident as he surveys the assembly of senior figures in front of him. We're expecting him to bring us up to date on recent developments, but after a brief greeting, he hands over to General Hemistos to do it for him.</p>
   <p>«Simnia's almost ready with their full army,» reports the General. «But I don't have such good news from elsewhere. Kamara has promised very little. The Niojan ambassadors tell us they're facing delays. Jon, Amara and Bandid have promised to send what they can but none of them have large armies. As for the League of City States, they've been cut off by Prince Amrag taking Turai and they're terrified to leave their borders.»</p>
   <p>«What about the Far West?»</p>
   <p>«Kastlin promises some archers but who knows how long it will take them to arrive? As for the Elves in the Southern Isles,» The General raises his hands. «A messenger eagle arrived today and the news wasn't good. They hope to be able to sail soon, but we can't count on them bringing anything like the number of warriors they did last time.»</p>
   <p>This causes some disquiet. Everyone knows we need the Elves. We can't defeat the full forces of the East without them. The General turns to Lisutaris. «Mistress of the Sky, what's the situation with your Guild?»</p>
   <p>«Every Sorcerer in the West will be here if I have to summon them with a transportation spell. If our army isn't going to be as strong as last time, we'll still have the most powerful Sorcerous force ever assembled.»</p>
   <p>The dignitaries are temporarily heartened. Lasat Axe of Gold punctures the mood by reminding everyone that Orcish sorcery is also stronger than it used to be. «They still control dragons, and their means of countermanding our sorcery have grown stronger. Only last month, Mistress of the Sky, you found yourself bested by their leader, Deeziz the Unseen.»</p>
   <p>«I was not bested,» says Lisutaris, cooly.</p>
   <p>«Turai fell.»</p>
   <p>«And I'm about to take it back. Which brings us to the next issue. It's time we selected a War Leader.»</p>
   <p>Hemistos frowns. «Not everyone is here yet.»</p>
   <p>«There are enough of us. We need a War Leader now and I put myself forward, as Head of the Sorcerers Guild.»</p>
   <p>General Hemistos looks rather dubiously towards King Gardos, probably wondering if it's going to be awkward for a Samsarinan to support Lisutaris. It will be if Gardos wants the position himself. The first person to speak out is the leader of the Niojan delegation.</p>
   <p>«We were on the point of proposing Bishop-General Ritari.»</p>
   <p>Ritari is commander of the Niojan Eastern armies. I've no idea what sort of man he is, but it hardly matters. There's no chance of the West following a Niojan leader. No one much likes them, even if they do have a very high opinion of themselves.</p>
   <p>«Shouldn't the position go to General Acarius?» asks a delegate from Juval. «He's our most experienced soldier.»</p>
   <p>«He's also past sixty,» mutters one of the Niojans.</p>
   <p>«I support Lisutaris,» says the leader of the ambassadors from Abelesi, a small state on the South Coast. «She has the most experience in warfare.»</p>
   <p>Voices are raised and the meeting quickly loses all sense of order. I was expecting as much. Choosing a War Leader has never been an easy process. There's no formally recognised way of doing it. No laws or treaties between the nations specify how it should be carried out. It's simply a matter of finding a person that most people will follow, and that's often proved difficult. It's sometimes happened that the soldier or politician most qualified for the task hasn't been chosen, because neighbouring countries didn't trust him, or were envious. Nations are always jealous and suspicious of each other. That's one reason the post has sometimes been filled by a Sorcerer. With their guild being international, they're not quite so strongly identified with a single country.</p>
   <p>The Niojans press their case for Bishop-General Ritari but the feeling in the Assembly Hall is that no military man can command enough support. Despite this, people hang back from agreeing on Lisutaris. Their doubts are given voice by Charius the Wise, who suggests that if the War Leader is going to be a Sorcerer, it should be Lasat Axe of Gold.</p>
   <p>«Would that not be rather irregular?» asks the Ambassador from Abelesi. «Lisutaris is head of the Guild, after all.»</p>
   <p>«Not everyone agreed with that decision,» says Charius. «There were doubts about the veracity of the voting.»</p>
   <p>«There were no doubts!» thunders Lisutaris. «I was the clear winner.» That's true, as far as it goes. She did win the election, but only after some cynical manoeuvring involving theft, bribery and blackmail, carried out by the most shameless citizens in Turai. Me and Makri, mostly. I remain proud of our efforts. The King, who's been silent for a while, directs a question at Lasat. «Do you seek the post?»</p>
   <p>«I would accept it, if necessary,» replies Lasat.</p>
   <p>«We'd favour Lasat Axe of Gold over Lisutaris,» says the ambassador from Simnia. That's not a great surprise. Simnia has never liked Turai.</p>
   <p>«As would my Samsarinan troops,» adds Baron Mabados.</p>
   <p>«But the Elves wouldn't,» I say, raising my voice. «Every Elvish Island trusts Lisutaris.» That shuts everyone up for a moment. We need the Elves.</p>
   <p>«Perhaps it's not quite time to, eh…» the King looks hopelessly at General Hemistos. The General himself seems unsure of how to proceed.</p>
   <p>«I suggest waiting a day or two,» says Lasat. «To give us time to reflect.»</p>
   <p>That probably means to give hime time to bribe people. It's not satisfactory, but the meeting breaks up without agreement. Lisutaris has taken it all fairly calmly, though she's every right to be furious at the disloyalty of the Samsarinan Sorcerers. As we're leaving, the King approaches. I'm expecting him to consult with Lisutaris over important war matters, but instead he asks Makri about his dragon.</p>
   <p>«He's doing well,» Makri tells him. «He's been flapping his wings. I think he might be flying soon.»</p>
   <p>«Excellent! You must keep me informed. Lasat is constructing a special barrier to contain the creature once it can fly.»</p>
   <p>«I hope the dragon eats Lasat,» says Lisutaris, as we leave the Assembly Hall. «Damn him and these Samsarinans. And the Simnians.»</p>
   <p>«I can't really see the Niojans supporting you either,» I say. «They don't like women in positions of power.»</p>
   <p>«Life would be a lot easier if the Elves were here.»</p>
   <p>«Could we hold off till they arrive?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«No. It needs to be decided soon. Prince Amrag isn't going to waste any time.»</p>
   <p>I notice Makri rubbing her ribs, and ask her about her injuries. She says she's fine.</p>
   <p>«Are you ready to fight tomorrow?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so.»</p>
   <p>«You don't sound keen.»</p>
   <p>Makri shrugs. She's still not enamoured of the tournament.</p>
   <p>«You need to win,» I tell her. «Now more than ever. If it comes down to a straight choice between Lisutaris and Lasat, your status as her fighter might count for a lot. Lasat is sponsoring Elupus, it'll sway peoples' opinion if he wins.»</p>
   <p>«That sounds stupid,» says Makri. «And illogical.»</p>
   <p>«People are stupid and illogical.»</p>
   <p>«I'm afraid Thraxas is right,» says Lisutaris. «Is is important that you do better than Elupus. Quick, hide me.»</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«Kublinos is back there. I can't take any more of his romancing me at the moment.»</p>
   <p>Makri and I shield Lisutaris as we move away, trying to evade Kublinos.</p>
   <p>«Don't make it obvious I'm avoiding him,» says Lisutaris. «I might still need to borrow money.»</p>
   <p>«I thought you didn't mind Kublinos?» I say.</p>
   <p>«I don't. But he's very persistent, and it's not really the best time for a romance, is it? Not when we're heading for war.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not sure about that,» I say. «Don't romances flourish before a war? Last chance for some happiness before everyone gets slaughtered?»</p>
   <p>«I don't think it's appropriate.»</p>
   <p>«I think you may just be using the war as an excuse to avoid emotional entanglement,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>This brings us to a halt. Lisutaris stares at Makri. «What?»</p>
   <p>«People who are nervous about any sort of emotional involvement do tend to look for external excuses to avoid it.»</p>
   <p>«What nonsense,» says the Sorcerer. «Whoever said such a thing?»</p>
   <p>«Samanatius.»</p>
   <p>«What did that old philosopher know about emotional entanglements?»</p>
   <p>«A lot,» insists Makri. «He knew how people think.» She suddenly looks completely deflated. «I miss Samanatius.»</p>
   <p>There's nothing much to say to that. The old philosopher is undoubtedly dead, buried in the wreckage of Turai. Makri, perhaps finally feeling the effects of her efforts over the past weeks, falls silent, and looks tired and depressed as we make our way home in silence. The sun has gone down but the streets are still vibrant, with merry revellers spilling out of taverns, laughing and singing. Elath is now packed full of visitors, and the local authority has set up more oil lamps in the streets, illuminating the scene. As neither Lisutaris, Makri nor I are feeling much like revelling, it's a relief to reach Arichdamis's house. My relief is short-lived. Merlione is waiting for me. She's wearing a rough, dark cloak and hood over her normal garments, having travelled here in disguise. That's understandable. It's a huge breach of etiquette for a Baron's daughter to be out visiting strangers late at night. Mabados would erupt if he knew. I lead her into one of Arichdamis's guest-rooms where we can talk in private.</p>
   <p>«I only have a few minutes,» she says. «I have to get back before anyone misses me. Someone tried to kill me today.»</p>
   <p>«Tell me what happened.» We're interrupted by a loud crashing noise and Merlione jumps anxiously. «It's all right, it's just Makri and the dragon.»</p>
   <p>Merlione calms herself, with difficulty. The strain is getting to her. «I went out into our flower garden and someone shot an arrow at me.»</p>
   <p>«Who?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. I didn't see. They must have been in the bushes, or the trees. But I bent down to pick a flower and at that moment an arrow went past me and stuck in the fence.» She reaches into the depths of her cloak, producing the arrow.</p>
   <p>«What happened then?»</p>
   <p>«I ran inside.» She looks anguished. «I didn't tell anyone. They won't believe me. My father already thinks I'm making things up.»</p>
   <p>«You should tell your mother. She'll believe you.»</p>
   <p>«I don't want to worry her more. Everything's so difficult already.»</p>
   <p>«Tell her. She can cope. And stay indoors from now on.»</p>
   <p>«Have you found anything out?» she asks.</p>
   <p>I admit I haven't made much progress, though I assure her I'm working on it. I escort her home, and keep watch till she's safely inside.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-One</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Next morning I set off early. With no strong leads and not much to go on, it's time to start bothering people. I'm intending to talk to anyone who might know anything about Baron Mabados's family. I spend the next six hours doing precisely that. In the main I talk to servants, but also question the messenger who delivers letters to Mabados's mansion, an apprentice at the saddler where he has his horses outfitted, and a woman who's been hired to provide flower arrangements for his son's wedding. It costs me some bribe money but that can't be helped. Servants don't just gossip to strangers for free.</p>
   <p>The saddler's apprentice introduces me to a another apprentice at the coach repair shop, where I manage to inspect the carriage that killed Alceten, which was damaged in the collision. It's a medium-sized phaeton, similar to the one Kublinos has lent to Lisutaris. These phaetons aren't very grand, and while there's a cover to provide shelter from the elements, they're quite open at the front. I'm not certain anyone could remain concealed while driving. There is a tall foot-guard. It might be possible to lie behind that, if you were small enough. Merlione did say that visibility was poor. I leave the repair shop unconvinced either way.</p>
   <p>Thanks to Lisutaris, I've managed to secure an appointment with Daringos, the King's Chief Steward. He's too busy to spare me more than five minutes, but when I meet him by arrangement at the Assembly House, he's friendlier than I anticipated. He goes so far as to tell me he can understand why there might be suspicions about Alceten's death, as it was such a shocking and unexpected event.</p>
   <p>«But I looked into it thoroughly, and it was an accident. Someone stole the carriage from Baron Girimos's grounds the night before. We haven't been able to find out the culprits, though it was probably some revellers from out of town. Elath can be boisterous during the tournament. Whoever took it abandoned it in the street. The horses were probably nervous, and they bolted. Probably startled by dogs, there are quite a few strays down there.»</p>
   <p>«Can you be sure it wasn't deliberate?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«There was nothing to suggest it was. The senior record keeper, Zinlantol, saw it happen. She's a reliable witness.»</p>
   <p>«You don't think there could have been someone driving the carriage?»</p>
   <p>«Of course not. Zinlantol would have seen him. Besides, why would anyone kill that poor young woman? I've investigated quite a few misdeeds in my time, and there's always a motive. No one had a motive for killing the Record Keeper's daughter. She didn't have an enemy in the world. I'm sure of that, I know the family.»</p>
   <p>«If the carriage was empty, could someone have startled the horses deliberately?»</p>
   <p>The King's Chief steward is surprised at the suggestion, but retains his polite composure. «I suppose that would be possible, but again, someone would have seen it.»</p>
   <p>«Did you ask the local Sorcerers to look into it?»</p>
   <p>«That's not really the sort of work our Sorcerers do,» replies Daringos. «Especially with all the war preparations going on.»</p>
   <p>I can't find much fault with this. Back in Turai, the authorities probably wouldn't have investigated the matter any more thoroughly than Daringos has. Not for someone as unimportant as the Record Keeper's daughter. I've realised by now that I'm not going to learn anything here. I depart, feeling that I haven't made any progress. By the time I arrive back at Arichdamis's house I'm weary and looking forward to a rest before Makri's first fight in the late afternoon. I find her in the garden with Lisutaris, in the warm sun.</p>
   <p>«I hope you're not giving any of that thazis to Makri. She has to fight today. Besides, I need it.» I join them on the grass, with my back to the wall of the house.</p>
   <p>«Busy day investigating?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I asked questions all over town.» I inhale from Lisutaris's thazis stick.</p>
   <p>«What did you learn?»</p>
   <p>«Mabados's saddler doesn't like him. He's late paying his bills.»</p>
   <p>«That's it?»</p>
   <p>«Just about. I've never met such a bunch of poorly-informed servants and shopkeepers. Hardly a scrap of decent information. Although Mabados not paying his bills was a recurrent theme.»</p>
   <p>«Aristocrats are always like that,» says Makri. «They're always late paying tradesmen.»</p>
   <p>«True. The saddler doesn't like Baron Vosanos either. He owes them a lot of money even though he's the richest man in town.» I turn to Lisutaris. «I need your help.» I describe the recent attack on Merlione.</p>
   <p>«I wondered why Merlione was here last night,» says Makri. «I thought it might be some sort of secret liaison.»</p>
   <p>«Very amusing Makri.»</p>
   <p>«Well, you fascinated her mother. If you sleep with the daughter as well, isn't that some sort of crime against the Gods?»</p>
   <p>«You don't believe in our Gods. And could you abandon your attempts at humour? You've been sarcastic ever since you found out about me and Baroness Demelzos. I don't think it's that strange we had an affair.»</p>
   <p>«Everybody else does.»</p>
   <p>«Are you hoping I can look back in time,» says Lisutaris. «To catch a glimpse of the crime?»</p>
   <p>«Something like that.»</p>
   <p>«The kuriya has been unresponsive. I've already tried to find out who took Arichdamis's plans. I got nowhere. I knew the moons were going into a bad alignment but it's happened much quicker than I expected. I think my Guild's astronomical charts may be flawed.»</p>
   <p>«Could you find out who fired this?» I ask, showing Lisutaris the arrow. She studies it for a few moments, then shakes her head.</p>
   <p>«Sorry, it's been touched by too many people. Iron-tipped arrows never retain much information about their past.»</p>
   <p>I shake my head in frustration. «Is there anything you could do?»</p>
   <p>«Like what?»</p>
   <p>«Something brilliant, worthy of the Head of the Sorcerers Guild. If I could just find out what Alceten was working on in the Royal Record House everything might fall into place.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris rolls herself another thazis stick and thinks for a few moments. «When she was at the Record House, was she usually in one place?»</p>
   <p>«She was working in one of the upstairs rooms. But it's a large room, and there are so many different documents in there I can't tell what she was doing.»</p>
   <p>«I might be able to narrow it down for you. Do you have anything that belonged to her?»</p>
   <p>«Merlione gave me this.» I take out a small, lace handkerchief. It looks incongruous in my large hand.</p>
   <p>«Good,» says Lisutaris. «This might be a help. Lace does retain a lot of information.»</p>
   <p>It's the first I've heard of it. Sometimes I think these Sorcerers just make it up as they go along. «If we leave soon we can visit the Record House before Makri's fight. We need to leave enough time for the bookmaker as well.»</p>
   <p>«How is our betting going?» asks the Sorcerer.</p>
   <p>«Well. We had over 2,700 gurans. I had to use some for bribes today. And I'll keep back a little for our expenses. It still leaves us 2,500 for betting on Makri. Feel free to congratulate me on the brilliance of my gambling strategy.»</p>
   <p>«Congratulations on your brilliance,» says Lisutaris. She doesn't really sound like she means it.</p>
   <p>Outside a group of children are hanging around. They yell when we appear. «There she is!» The children stare at Makri, but when she takes a step forward they scream and run off.</p>
   <p>«That was annoying,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«At least they weren't throwing stones.»</p>
   <p>The children aren't the only ones interested in Makri. As we drive slowly through the town, pedestrians, catching sight of her, nudge their companions, and point.</p>
   <p>«I'm starting to feel self-conscious.»</p>
   <p>I tell Makri not to worry. «They're not pointing you out as a weird Orcish freak any more. Now they're pointing you out as a successful fighter.»</p>
   <p>«Thanks. That makes me feel a lot better.»</p>
   <p>At the Royal Record house, Cetenos is just as downcast as before, though he brightens a little on learning that I've asked Lisutaris to help. He takes us to the room where his daughter worked, then leaves us alone. Lisutaris fumbles around inside her magic purse.</p>
   <p>«I can't find the handkerchief. There it is… no, that's one of mine… I'm sure it's here somewhere…»</p>
   <p>«Could you learn how to use your magic purse properly?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks pained. «It's really large inside, I haven't got the hang of it yet. Here it is.» She produces the small piece of lace then throws it into the air. It hovers in front of her. She speaks a few words in one of the arcane languages she uses. The handkerchief languidly floats over to one corner of the room where it descends onto a chair.</p>
   <p>«That's where Alceten was working the last time she was here,» says Lisutaris. The lace handkerchief has landed at a table beside several cabinets full of documents, and there are shelves nearby, packed with books and scrolls.</p>
   <p>«Mining records,» says Makri, examining the papers in the cabinet. «And some family records on the shelves. Some tax records too. This doesn't really belong here, does it?» She picks up a very weighty tome from the table. «<emphasis>Samsarinan Commercial Law</emphasis>. This should be over with the other legal books.»</p>
   <p>I study the huge book. It is out of place.</p>
   <p>«Do you think Alceten found some sort of illegal transaction?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Maybe. It would have to be serious if someone killed her because of it. And I don't see how it would involve Merlione.» I glance at all the other records strewn around. Lisutaris has narrowed things down but there's still a lot to examine, and I'm not at my best with ancient legal scrolls and documents. I ask the Sorcerer if she could place our bet on Makri. «It'll let me make a start here. I'll meet you later at the fight.»</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris can't go into a bookmaker's shop,» says Makri. «It will destroy her status.»</p>
   <p>«You could do it.» I hand our money over to Makri. «Just make sure you get it right.»</p>
   <p>«You make sure you get to the fight on time,» says Lisutaris. «You need to lead Makri out. I can't do that either.»</p>
   <p>Managing a sword-fighter is regarded as a low-class occupation. Though Barons and their ilk always show an interest in the fighters, none of them would sully their reputation by leading one on to the field.</p>
   <p>Left on my own in the record room, I'm daunted by the prospect of wading through so many official records. Maybe I'll get lucky. Perhaps I'll find something quickly. The first scroll I pick up is entitled <emphasis>Assignment of copper-mining rights in the Southern provinces in the last fourteen years of the reign of King Garasolos</emphasis>. My heart sinks. King Garasolos lived two centuries ago. I put it down and turn to the book on commercial law instead. It's written in the dense hand of a copyist whose writing is clear, but small, and a strain to read. I manage half a page on the rights of Port Authorities to levy taxes on incoming goods before putting it down with a feeling of despair. Perhaps instead of trying to read all these books and scrolls, I should just hang around close to Merlione, and hope someone fires another arrow at her.</p>
   <p>I sigh, shake my head, and get back to work, already feeling that it was a mistake not to bring some ale with me. Sitting on my own at the desk, surrounded by scrolls, makes me remember an uncomfortable occasion, many years ago, when, having failed to complete an assignment at Sorcerer's college, I was sent to study on my own while the rest of the class practiced spells in the grounds. I never did like that tutor.</p>
   <p>After reading for two hours, I have a reasonable knowledge of Samsarinan commercial law relating to imports, some insights into the complexities of copper-mining rights, and no more idea about who might have killed Alceten than I had in the first place. There's a large candle on the main desk, marked off in hours, and it's a relief when I notice it's time to go. I leave the desk neatly arranged, so I'll know what books and scrolls I've looked at.</p>
   <p>By the time I arrive at the tournament, Lisutaris is fretting. «Thraxas! You're late. Have you been in a tavern?»</p>
   <p>«Of course. I had to wash the dust from these books out my mouth. When's Makri fighting?»</p>
   <p>«In about thirty seconds.»</p>
   <p>«Did you get the bet on?»</p>
   <p>«Yes, Makri went into Bixo's. But I'm worried. She's been drawn against Basinos.»</p>
   <p>I screw up my face. That is a tough draw. The Champion of the Southern Armies is going to be a difficult opponent. «Well, she can beat him anyway.»</p>
   <p>«I hope so,» says Lisutaris. «Basinos is sponsored by Baron Mabados. Every Samsarinan Sorcerer will be on his side.»</p>
   <p>«Can't you sort these Sorcerers out?»</p>
   <p>«I'd rather they didn't know I suspect them of using sorcery. It'll be easier for me to negate their efforts if they don't know I'm onto them.»</p>
   <p>«I think we should just confront them. Get their cheating out into the open.»</p>
   <p>«I can't take on the whole Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild, Thraxas.»</p>
   <p>«Yes you can.»</p>
   <p>«No, I don't think I can.»</p>
   <p>I clap Lisutaris heartily on the shoulder. «I have confidence in you.»</p>
   <p>«How may beers did you have?»</p>
   <p>«Three or four. I forget exactly. Here's Makri. Right, it's time to show these villains what three Turanians can do.»</p>
   <p>«So I'm a Turanian now?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Of course. We welcome anyone. Let's go.»</p>
   <p>The red-shirted Marshal is waiting for us in the centre of the field. Basinos approaches slowly from the opposite direction, and he gets the loudest cheer so far. As champion of the Southern Armies he's a well-known fighter, and if not exactly local, he is Samsarinan. It's immediately obvious that Basinos is a cut above most of the fighters we've seen in the preliminary rounds. His equipment is better; he has a nicely burnished helmet, fine chainmail over his chest and midriff, and the armour plating around his shoulders and arms is good quality work. Makri looks shabby in comparison, with her long hair tumbling out of her iron helmet. Her shield is made of plain brown leather, whereas Basinos's is bright blue, with a fancy metal boss in the centre, in the shape of a roaring lion. Basinos's sword is longer and heavier. He's ten inches taller than Makri, and looks about twice as broad. He approaches slowly, milking the applause. Makri stands motionless. The Marshal raises his flag. I retreat quickly to the side of the field, and by the time I look round, Basinos has already mounted a furious attack.</p>
   <p>Makri defends gamely, but it's not the easiest thing to do, defending with a sword and shield if you're not used to it. If mishandled, the shield can easily pass in front of your eyes, restricting your vision. If you try to use it offensively, and get it wrong, you leave an opening for your opponent. If you're too defensive, you constrict your own movements and can't attack effectively. Conversely, it's hard to mount an effective attack against a man who knows how to defend properly with a shield, which Basinos does. Several of Makri's previous opponents left obvious gaps which she could exploit with her speed, but Basinos is of a different calibre. Makri is forced backwards, and her occasional strikes, with which she attempts to go over or under his shield, are all blocked quite easily.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris has her arms by her side, but her palms are facing forwards. She's feeling for sorcery, ready to nullify it if necessary. There's a loud clang as Basinos's sword crashes into Makri's shield. The impact forces her back. By the time she regains her stance, Basinos, in the same offensive movement, has swung his sword beneath her shield where it slams into the chainmail protecting her thigh. The crowd roar and the Marshal raises his flag.</p>
   <p>«Half-point to Basinos!» he cries.</p>
   <p>By now I'm frowning. I don't think that half-point arrived as the result of hostile sorcery. It came because Basinos is a very skilled fighter. The contest recommences. Makri is again forced back. The crowd are screaming, roaring him on. He's strong and fast; one of the fastest tournament fighters I've ever seen. Somewhere nearby I can hear Baron Mabados, adding his voice to the crowd.</p>
   <p>«Come on Makri!» I yell. Basinos attacks, again forcing Makri back. He attempts a cut across the top of Makri's shield which she blocks, but then, with the same movement he used before, he rotates his elbow, bringing his blade down towards Makri's thigh. But this time, instead of connecting with her thigh, it thuds into her shield, which Makri has immediately, and correctly, repositioned. At the same moment she slices her blade across the top of Basinos's shield which, as a result of his attack, is hanging an inch too low. Her blade snaps against his neck guard. That should be enough for a lethal stroke but Makri, not content, or not trusting the Marshal, instantly brings her sword down onto Basinos's wrist, knocking his blade from his hand, before bringing it back up in an arc to rest once more at his throat. That makes two lethal strikes, though technically you can only have one. The crowd falls silent. Basinos stands rigid, as if in shock. The Marshal looks disappointed.</p>
   <p>«Lethal stroke,» he says, eventually.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris and I cheer, very conspicuously given the silence around us. I rush onto the field to congratulate Makri. Unusually, she's still facing her opponent.</p>
   <p>«Good fight,» she says to him. He acknowledges her, before trudging off.</p>
   <p>«Excellent work, Makri,» cries Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>Makri takes off her helmet and shrugs. «It wasn't so great. I'd have a leg wound if this was real. He was a good fighter.» She stares at her shield. «I can't get used to this thing.»</p>
   <p>I'm jubilant as we make our way from the field. I ask Lisutaris and Makri what odds they got at the bookmakers.</p>
   <p>«Seven to Four,» Makri tells me. «Basinos was favourite, two to five.»</p>
   <p>«But we didn't bet everything,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>We've used some of our money for expenses, and I've had bribes to pay, but we still had 2,500 gurans left before this fight. I'd expected Lisutaris and Makri to gamble it all.</p>
   <p>«We decided it was too much of a risk,» explains Makri. «If I'd lost we'd have had nothing left. I thought it was best to keep 1,000 back. We could have used that to bet on other fighters. Because if I lost then Lisutaris would have needed to come up with 10,000 for Lasat.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris and Makri look at me. «Are you going to disapprove?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>I shrug. «Not really. It was sensible enough. Although I didn't know we were being sensible. I'd have bet everything.»</p>
   <p>Big Bixo isn't exactly radiating happiness as he hands over our winnings, but he's not too downcast either. He's still made a solid profit from all the money that was placed on Basinos. Our 1,500 bet at seven to four wins us 2625. Plus the original stake makes 4125. Plus the 1,000 we held back now gives us 5125 gurans. Our pile of money includes some heavy hundred-guran coins and even a thousand-guran gold bar, which Lisutaris carries in her magic purse.</p>
   <p>Before Makri's fight with Basinos, she was fourteen to one to win the tournament. That will come down now. Elupus remains the overall favourite, at three to one. As we leave Big Bixo's I'm mulling over our next bet.</p>
   <p>«I think we should just bet it all.»</p>
   <p>Makri disagrees. «It's too much of a risk.»</p>
   <p>«Why? You'll win. If it was me suggesting it was too much of a risk to bet everything on you, you'd get upset. You'd say I lacked confidence in you.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe,» says Makri. «But I just think we should be cautious. Something might go wrong.»</p>
   <p>«What can go wrong?»</p>
   <p>«Hostile sorcery.»</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris can deal with that.»</p>
   <p>«So you keep saying,» says Lisutaris. «Mainly because you don't know what it's like trying to fend off Lasat, Charius and a dozen others at the same time.»</p>
   <p>«I have complete confidence in you. And Makri.»</p>

   <title>
    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Two</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>On the way home we stop off at a tavern where Lisutaris eats a moderate lunch, I order three venison pies and a portion of stew with yams, and Makri nibbles at some bread. We arrive back at Arichdamis's house in probably our most genial mood since we washed up on these shores.</p>
   <p>«Lasat Axe of Gold and Charius the Wise are in the garden,» Arichdamis tells us. Our genial mood evaporates.</p>
   <p>«This is it,» mutters Lisutaris. «He's come to blackmail me about the missing plans. It was bound to happen. Makri, put your sword away, we can't just kill them.»</p>
   <p>«We could make it look like an accident.»</p>
   <p>«That might work,» I say.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris stares at us. «What's the matter with you? We're not murdering anyone. Have you lost your senses?»</p>
   <p>Slightly abashed, we follow Lisutaris out into the garden.</p>
   <p>«I think we could get away with it,» whispers Makri.</p>
   <p>It's not immediately apparent what Lasat and Charius are up to. They've arrived with a company of workmen who are busy some distance away, at the point where Arichdamis's grounds slope upwards towards the hills. As we watch, the workmen stretch rope between some of the larger trees.</p>
   <p>«What's going on?» I ask Arichdamis.</p>
   <p>«They're making a cage for the dragon before it can fly away.»</p>
   <p>«They're building a dragon cage out of a few ropes?»</p>
   <p>«That's just the framework. Once they've cordoned off the area, Lasat and Charius are going to cast spells over it.»</p>
   <p>«I don't like this,» says Makri. «It's not really very nice to keep a dragon in a cage.»</p>
   <p>«You hate the dragon.»</p>
   <p>«We've been getting on better.»</p>
   <p>Protocol demands that Lisutaris greet her fellow Sorcerers. Before approaching them, she instructs Makri and me to be tactful. «Don't start any arguments. I don't want them to suspect that we know they've been using sorcery against Makri. Be diplomatic.»</p>
   <p>«I'm always diplomatic,» says Makri. «It's Thraxas you have to worry about.»</p>
   <p>«Makri is much less tactful than I am!»</p>
   <p>«Also, try not to argue like a pair of schoolchildren,» says Lisutaris, and sets off towards the edge of the garden. The encounter with the Samsarinan Sorcerers is tense, as always. The frozen politeness displayed on each side doesn't do anything to hide the mutual dislike. Lasat is as self-important as ever, talking grandly to Charius about the brilliance of his new magic which will, apparently, keep the dragon permanently in place, allowing them to learn the secrets of dragon control.</p>
   <p>«That will be a great step forward for Samsarina,» he says. «Imagine having our own dragons to combat the Orcs.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks highly sceptical, though she keeps her silence. I'm sceptical too, not really believing that any human will ever fly on a dragon. Lasat is so pleased with himself that he magnanimously thanks Makri for feeding the creature. «The King himself is grateful. You should be honoured.»</p>
   <p>«I am,» says Makri, attempting to be diplomatic.</p>
   <p>«Congratulations on defeating Basinos,» continues Lasat. «Even Elupus praised your technique. Perhaps some people did under-estimate your prowess.»</p>
   <p>«Perhaps they did,» says Lisutaris. «Perhaps they underestimate mine, too.»</p>
   <p>«I don't follow your meaning, Mistress of the Sky.»</p>
   <p>«I mean those people who are questioning my role as Head of the Sorcerers Guild, and position as War Leader.»</p>
   <p>Lasat Axe of Gold draws himself up and looks, for a moment at least, quite grand, with his rainbow cloak and his long grey hair fluttering in the breeze.</p>
   <p>«No personal insult was intended,» he declares. «But War Leader is too important a role to be given to someone who's claim to the position of Head of the Guild is dubious at best.»</p>
   <p>«Dubious?» cries Lisutaris. «You dare to call my election dubious?»</p>
   <p>«What else would I call it? The whole process was a charade. The authorities in Turai used every low, despicable trick imaginable to get you elected. I haven't forgotten your scandalous attempt to blackmail me, using quite untrue allegations.»</p>
   <p>«Untrue? You've been cheating your treasury for years!» shouts Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I must ask you not to repeat these lies!» roars Lasat.</p>
   <p>I don't like the way his hand is hovering around his waist. It looks like he's tempted to fire a spell. I find my own hand straying towards the spell-protection charm round my neck.</p>
   <p>«If you do,» Lasat continues. «There will be serious consequences!»</p>
   <p>«Are you attempting to threaten me!» yells Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«And what if I am? You're not in Turai now, with your legion of spies, cheats and criminals to help you! Let's see how you fare without them by your side!»</p>
   <p>«You'll see how I'll fare if you dare to challenge me!» shouts Lisutaris. «I'll send you out of Elath as a smoking pile of cinders. And while I'm on the subject of your despicable behaviour, stop trying to cheat in the tournament.»</p>
   <p>«Cheat? Me? How dare you!»</p>
   <p>«You've been using sorcery against Makri!» Lisutaris strides right up to Lasat and stands with her face close to his. «It had better not happen again or I'll make you regret it.»</p>
   <p>Charius the Wise is surreptitiously raising his hand, unseen by Lisutaris. I swiftly unsheathe my sword and place the tip in his midriff. «Do you think you can utter that spell before I run you through?»</p>
   <p>The garden is now sizzling with barely suppressed sorcery. Venomous looks are exchanged in all directions. Lasat Axe of Gold claps his hands, summoning his workers, then speaks to Charius. «Come, Charius. The King is not going to be pleased to learn our work has been interrupted by a foreign Sorcerer. We'll return under his protection.»</p>
   <p>«You'll need a lot of protection if you annoy me again!» yells Lisutaris, at his retreating figure.</p>
   <p>I stare at Lisutaris. «What happened to tact and diplomacy?»</p>
   <p>«That was never a very good plan. You should have given me better advice.»</p>
   <p>«I'd advise you to find out if smoking too much magically-enhanced thazis causes mood swings.»</p>
   <p>«Thazis,» mutters Lisutaris. «Good idea.» She starts rolling a thazis stick without bothering to check if anyone is watching. I shepherd her behind a large tree, just in case.</p>
   <p>«I hate the Samsarinan Sorcerers,» she says.</p>
   <p>«Don't worry,» says Makri. «I'll win the tournament. Then Lasat will have to pay you 10,000 gurans and he'll look like a fool for backing a loser.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris sits down on the grass, quite heavily. «I suppose so. But these arguments aren't helping the war effort. What's the point of winning money if the Orcs march in and conquer everything?»</p>
   <p>«We could still flee to the Far West,» I suggest. «They say that right at the end of the world, you can find the <emphasis>Warrior's Rest</emphasis>.»</p>
   <p>«What's that? Some sort of monastery?»</p>
   <p>«No, a tavern. Sells excellent beer, apparently. They could probably do with a Sorcerer to look after things. And Makri would fit right in. Just get the chainmail bikini on again and start serving drinks.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not ending my days as a tavern wench,» declares Makri. «I'm going to kick the Orcs out of Turai then I'm going to university.»</p>
   <p>The young dragon appears out of the undergrowth. I tense up, ready to fight, but it seems to have become less aggressive. It waddles up to Makri, stretches its wings, then lies down beside her and goes to sleep. The dragon is now larger than a man, and must be very close to taking flight. Now that it's no longer a baby, its scales are starting to grow properly, and they're pure white. It's an unusual sight. Makri puts her arm over it protectively. She's due to fight again later in the evening, by which time the competitors will be down to sixteen. I'd like to remain here, doing nothing, but I can't. I still have investigating to do.</p>
   <p>«Makri, would you help me at the Records Office? I just can't read through all that stuff on my own.»</p>
   <p>«All right. If Lisutaris doesn't need me for a while.»</p>
   <p>«It's fine, go with Thraxas,» says the Sorcerer. «I've agreed to have dinner with Kublinos. He's persistent, I'll give him that. He even pretended to like my Turanian hairstyle, even though I know the Barons' wives have been criticising it behind my back.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks round at Makri and me. There's a long pause. «Well?» she says, eventually.</p>
   <p>«Well what?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«You know what I mean.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks baffled. «I don't understand.»</p>
   <p>«How hopeless are you?» demands Lisutaris. «When I say the Barons' wives have been criticising my hairstyle, you're both meant to say my hair looks wonderful. Wasn't that obvious?»</p>
   <p>«Sorry,» says Makri. «I'm not very good at picking up on things like that.»</p>
   <p>«Neither am I,» I admit.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris sighs. «I dread to think what your life was like in that tavern. Obviously you never learned any proper manners.» A maudlin expression settles over her features. «Tirini would be shocked if she saw me now. She'd say I looked a terrible mess.»</p>
   <p>«I was thinking of Tirini too, just the other day,» I say.</p>
   <p>«She was one of the last people we saw in Turai,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>Tirini Snake-Smiter is, or perhaps was, a Turanian Sorcerer. She had powerful magic, but she was much more famous for her glamorous outfits and her continual appearances in the city's scandal-sheets. She was in the Avenging Axe, just before the city fell, looking after Lisutaris when she was ill. Poor Tirini was horrified to find herself in the shabby environs of my rooms above the tavern. I wasn't too pleased to see her there myself, but thinking of her now, I feel nostalgic for my old city, and depressed about its destruction.</p>
   <p>«I wonder how many of my Guild survived?» wonders Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I think there's a good chance a lot of the Sorcerers made it out.»</p>
   <p>«If they have, none of them have managed to contact me yet.»</p>
   <p>Makri and I depart, leaving Lisutaris to make ready for her assignation with Kublinos.</p>
   <p>«Do you think Kublinos and Lisutaris might get married?» asks Makri, as we walk through Elath.</p>
   <p>I notice she's looking uncomfortable. «Why? Does it bother you?»</p>
   <p>«A bit.»</p>
   <p>Makri, a recent arrival in the West, had very few friends in Turai, spending her time mostly working or studying. I suppose she's become friendly with Lisutaris, due to recent events, and worries about losing her. That would only leave me, and I'm always liable to get drunk and let her down.</p>
   <p>«I can't see Lisutaris really falling for Kublinos,» I tell her. «He wears that fancy cloak. Probably not Lisutaris's type.»</p>
   <p>«You have no idea what Lisutaris's type would be, do you?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«None at all. Here's the Record House. Prepare for some extended studying.»</p>
   <p>We have two hours before we're due at the tournament fields. Upstairs in the record house, I drag another chair over to the table in the corner, then carry on reading. Makri starts working her way through the contents of the shelves on the left and I take the cabinets on the right.</p>
   <p>«This is hopeless,» I say, after wading through a court report about some merchants who'd been swindled. «I can't take much more.»</p>
   <p>«We've only been here ten minutes.»</p>
   <p>«It feels like ten hours.»</p>
   <p>«I like it. It's interesting.»</p>
   <p>I sigh, and get back to work. I struggle through another court case concerning a merchant's complaint that he'd been cheated in a land deal, When he put up the funds for what was supposed to be a valuable Queenstone mine in the mountains, only for it to turn out worthless. I'm mildly surprised to notice that a co-signatory to the law suit is Baron Vosanos, who apparently lost a lot of money too. That will teach him to be greedy. I wonder if Baroness Demelzos knows about it. Perhaps her son isn't marrying into quite as rich a family as she thought. I turn to Makri and tell her that I really can't go on any longer. «My head's swimming with all these documents.»</p>
   <p>Makri shrugs. «If you want justice you need to do the work.»</p>
   <p>«Who said anything about justice? I'm earning a fee and helping Demelzos. Justice doesn't come into it.»</p>
   <p>«Well it should. Alceten deserves justice.»</p>
   <p>«Since when did you care about Alceten?»</p>
   <p>«Since I discovered she was murdered and nobody cared,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>I shake my head. Makri does get these odd ideas occasionally. She has a tendency to start going on about rights and justice, particularly where women are concerned. I blame the philosopher Samanatius. He was a bad influence.</p>
   <p>«This is Samsarina. Justice here is in even shorter supply than it was in Turai. If it turns out that Alceten <emphasis>was</emphasis> murdered, and someone influential was responsible, then forget about justice. It'll just be covered up.»</p>
   <p>«Then why are you even bothering to investigate?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«I told you. To help the Baroness. If I can solve this, and find out who's responsible, Demelzos will be able to protect her daughter. But that's as far as it will go. I've got no great hopes of sending anyone to court for murder. Samsarina doesn't work like that. The Barons have too much power to be held to account.»</p>
   <p>«Do you think one of them was responsible?»</p>
   <p>«Directly responsible? I doubt it. But it would need money and influence to organise the murder, and more to make sure people didn't talk afterwards. So someone well-connected was behind it. Anyone who's well-connected here ultimately has some Baron or other looking after him.»</p>
   <p>Makri isn't satisfied. «Are you saying that even if you find out who did it, nothing will happen?»</p>
   <p>«Probably. If the killer is being protected by a Baron, only the King could do anything about it. You've seen what the King is like. He's so young and inexperienced, he won't want to alienate anyone powerful.»</p>
   <p>«So someone can just kill a young woman and get away with it?»</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe I could make sure they don't.»</p>
   <p>I stare at Makri. «Abandon any thoughts of vigilante activity. It will reflect badly on Lisutaris.»</p>
   <p>«I'll bear that in mind,» says Makri, and gets back to her scroll. We read in silence for a while. I glance over my shoulder a few times at the marked candle, wishing that time would pass more quickly.</p>
   <p>«I haven't felt like this since I was at school,» I mutter.</p>
   <p>«You actually went to school?»</p>
   <p>«St Alembiun's Institute for the Children of Disadvantaged Turanian Citizens. One of the worst educational hell-holes in the city. I still dislike St Alembiun, whoever he was.»</p>
   <p>«A minor saint from Mattesh, before the True Church revised their canon,» Makri informs me.</p>
   <p>«Have you ever thought you might have learned too many things?»</p>
   <p>«I thought you said Baron Vosanos was rich,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«He is.»</p>
   <p>«Then why's he being sued for non-payment of taxes?»</p>
   <p>«Let me see that.» Makri has been studying a large tome of court documents, lists of upcoming cases. Baron Vosanos is indeed named in one of these case, accused by the King's Exchequer of not paying the required taxes on his estates.</p>
   <p>«That's odd. He's one of the most important men in the country. Why would he let that happen?»</p>
   <p>«Maybe he's broke,» says Makri. «Didn't you mention he was involved in some merchant deals that went wrong?»</p>
   <p>«Yes, but it didn't seem that serious. I can't believe he'd let things slide to the extent that he'd face being taken to court by the King.»</p>
   <p>I sit and think for a few moments. Vosanos's financial difficulties are interesting. Baron Mabados is reputed to have financial problems too. Mabados's son is marrying Vosanos's daughter. It's odd that both Barons are struggling. The marriage won't affect that one way or the other, as far as I know. I'll have to ask Baroness Demelzos for more information.</p>
   <p>«Dos this have some bearing on your case?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«I don't know. I can't see how it would involve Merlione. Whether she's alive or dead doesn't make any difference to how rich these Barons are. Still, I'd like to know more. Are there any other documents?»</p>
   <p>There's nothing else in the book, but it does provide a case number. I find a young assistant on the floor below and ask her if Cetenos is anywhere in the building, but apparently he's busy conveying records to the King's officials. I ask the assistant if she can show me any more documents relating to Baron Vosanos's case, and quote her the number. She leads me over to a huge filing cabinet, about the size of a small tree, then opens the top drawer and rummages around for a while.</p>
   <p>«Here you are,» she says, pulling out a brown leather folder with a number on it. «Everything will be in here.»</p>
   <p>I open the folder. It's empty. The assistant looks surprised.</p>
   <p>«Normally there'd be more papers on anything that had a case number. I don't know why there isn't.»</p>
   <p>I return upstairs to Makri. «The rest of the documents are missing.» I glance at the candle. «We have to go, you're fighting soon.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Three</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Heading back towards the arena, Makri is relaxed. I don't think she's given much thought to her next fight. It's quite a contrast to my own experience of the tournament. Then it was all I thought about for weeks. I'd practice during the day, and at night I'd go drinking with sword-fighting friends, swapping tales about fighters we'd seen, and lying about all the contests we'd won. It became my whole life. Makri does want to win, because she takes pride in her fighting technique, but she doesn't care about the competition. I find that annoying. She should respect it more.</p>
   <p>Makri's next opponent is Gabril-ixx, from the far north. He won a tournament recently, so he must be skilful, and in good form. Big Bixo has him as slight favourite at four to six, while Makri is eleven to ten. I'd like to bet everything we have but, heeding Makri and Lisutaris's desire to be more cautious, I put 2,500 gurans on Makri to win. Makri has a lot more backers now. She's still not popular with the crowd, but serious gamblers don't care about that. They've seen what she can do.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris meets us at the edge of the field. There's something strange about her manner.</p>
   <p>«You look odd,» I say.</p>
   <p>«Thanks, Thraxas. That's always good to hear.»</p>
   <p>«Why are you holding your head like that?» Lisutaris has her chin pushed down, almost resting on her chest. «What's that you're wearing?»</p>
   <p>«Nothing.»</p>
   <p>«Yes it is. I can see it sparkling.»</p>
   <p>«Oh this?» Lisutaris glances down at the heavy row of jewels currently dangling round her neck. It's a queenstone necklace, a very fine example.</p>
   <p>«It's just a… little gift,» she says, and blushes faintly. «From Kublinos.»</p>
   <p>«Did you agree to marry him?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Of course not! Why would you ask that?»</p>
   <p>«Because he's just given you the most expensive necklace this side of the King's treasury?» I suggest.</p>
   <p>«I had to accept it,» says Lisutaris, huffily. «It would have been rude not to. That doesn't mean I'm about to get married. The subject was never discussed. Makri, are you ready to fight?»</p>
   <p>«What are you going to say when he does ask?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Could we not discuss it right this moment? Thraxas, listen carefully. I'm convinced Lasat is going to make a serious attempt to sabotage Makri in this fight. I can deal with him and Charius, but the rest of their guild is here too, so there might be spells flying in from all directions. I'll need your to help to deflect them.»</p>
   <p>«Me? How am I meant to do that?»</p>
   <p>«You've had Sorcerous training, I believe?»</p>
   <p>«I got thrown out of Sorcerer's College as an apprentice. I only ever knew a few minor spells.»</p>
   <p>«That's not true,» says Lisutaris. «You used to know more than that, before you dedicated your life to drinking. You can help if you put your mind to it. I'll give you a spell for detecting incoming attacks.»</p>
   <p>«Thraxas is going to help you with your sorcery?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«I'm doomed.»</p>
   <p>«She may be right,» I say. «I really don't think I'm up to it.»</p>
   <p>«Fine,» says Lisutaris. «If you'd like to see me humiliated, Turai disgraced, Makri defeated, and Lasat elected as War Leader, why don't you just go and drink beer instead?»</p>
   <p>«All right I'll do it!» I glare at Makri. «Now I'm going to get killed from a heart attack spell, protecting your skinny hide.»</p>
   <p>«I'm sure no one will be firing heart attack spells,» says Lisutaris, calmly. «More likely they'll simply be trying to jolt Makri, to make her lose her balance. Anyway, you have your spell-protection necklace.»</p>
   <p>I can't say I'm feeling happy about this development. A good spell-protection necklace does go a long way towards nullifying hostile sorcery, but it won't keep out everything. Thraxas of Turai fears no man in combat, but I'm not that keen on being used as target practice by the Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild. Lisutaris takes a scrap of parchment from her purse and speaks to it. A sentence appears, though not in any language I know.</p>
   <p>«Read this,» she says.</p>
   <p>«I cant understand it.»</p>
   <p>«Just read it.»</p>
   <p>I do as instructed. Lisutaris then says the sentence out loud, and makes a peculiar motion with her hand in front of my eyes.</p>
   <p>«Now you'll be able to detect, attract and repel incoming spells,» she says.</p>
   <p>«What do you mean <emphasis>attract</emphasis>? No one said anything about attract.»</p>
   <p>«It's part of the process,» explains the Sorcerer, blithely. «Once you detect spells, they'll come towards you. You'll have plenty of time to deflect them. A good half-second or so.»</p>
   <p>«What if I don't?»</p>
   <p>«You may suffer some minor damage. Are you ready Makri? It's time for you to put on your armour.»</p>
   <p>Makri goes off to change. I scan the dense crowd, looking for hostile Sorcerers. There seems to be a rainbow cloak everywhere I look. The Samsarinan Guild has turned up in force. I find myself touching my spell protection necklace again, and wondering what exactly Lisutaris means by <emphasis>minor damage</emphasis>. As I lead Makri out onto the field I catch a glimpse of Lasat Axe of Gold, right next to the tower occupied by the Tournament Sorcerer. No doubt they're plotting something together. This time, when the Marshal raises his flag, I sprint back to Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Are you ready?» she asks.</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>The fight commences. Gabril-ixx adopts a cautious stance, well-protected by his shield. Too well protected perhaps, as he's slow to react to Makri's attack. She gets her sword underneath his defences, dealing him a blow on the leg which is only just short of being called a foul by the Marshal, for too much use of force. He stumbles slightly, by which time Makri is round to one side of him, with the blade of her sword at his neck, a stroke which in a real fight would take off his head. Makri wins, in one of the shortest fights so far. She comes off the field smiling.</p>
   <p>«I didn't give these Sorcerers any time to start firing spells.»</p>
   <p>We congratulate Makri.</p>
   <p>«Shall we pick up our winnings?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>We have to force our way through the crowd, many whom are pressing in to look at Makri. I can hear her name being mentioned all around, and the name of Elupus too, wondering what will happen if they're matched together. That's looking more and more likely. Makri is through to the last eight, and I don't see anyone else standing in her way. Apart from the Samsarinan Sorcerers, of course.</p>
   <p>«Next time Makri steps onto the field they'll be at it from the start.»</p>
   <p>«Probably,» agrees Lisutaris. «We'll have to make sure we're ready.»</p>
   <p>I shake my head in disgust. «It's a sorry state of affairs. The Samsarinan sword-fighting tournament was always known for its honesty. When I won, there was no magic involved. Just strong-hearted men battling it out. <emphasis>Lion-hearted</emphasis> might be a better description. A man had to be something special to win the tournament in those days.»</p>
   <p>«Like you?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Exactly. We were proper warriors. Fighting all day and drinking all night. Of course, Samsarina had a proper King then. He wouldn't have allowed his Sorcerers to run out of control. Everything's gone downhill since then. There's no honour any more. Not like in my day.»</p>
   <p>«Weren't you absent without leave from the army?» asks Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Yes. But honourably.»</p>
   <p>There's no sign of Big Bixo's previous good humour as I pick up our winnings. No sign of his business partner, either, though I have a strong feeling I'm not going to get out of Elath without encountering him again. Our 2,500 guran wager at 11–10 returned 5,250. Added to the 2,625 we held back, we now have 7,875 gurans.</p>
   <p>«Splendid fight, Makri!»</p>
   <p>It's General Hemistos. The General, a well-presented man on most occasions, is looking particularly smart. He's wearing his dress cloak and uniform, the sort of outfit he might wear on a formal parade.</p>
   <p>«Thank you,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«I have the sword I promised you.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks vague. The General reminds her that he promised to replace her sword with something better if she made it through the qualifying rounds. It's a good offer, I suppose. Makri's weapons and armour aren't the best.</p>
   <p>«If you'd like to accompany me now, we can pick it up. There's a hostelry just past the armourers which serves a better class of food, if you'd like to try their fare?»</p>
   <p>Makri looks momentarily confused. «I have to stay with Lisutaris. I'm her bodyguard.»</p>
   <p>«That's fine,» says Lisutaris, immediately. «I'm quite safe for the evening. I have Thraxas to protect me.»</p>
   <p>Makri shoots an angry glance at Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Pick up the sword,» I say. «Lisutaris can cope without you for a while.»</p>
   <p>«Excellent,» says the General, and sweeps her off.</p>
   <p>«That'll take her mind off me and Kublinos for a while,» says Lisutaris, as we walk on. It's a warm evening and the streets of Elath are noisier than ever. I feel a slight tingle as the spell Lisutaris taught me for repelling sorcerous attacks fades from my memory. She'll have to teach it to me again each time I use it. A person with as little magical skill as me can't hold a spell like that in their memory.</p>
   <p>«I wouldn't have thought you'd be so pleased to see Makri go off with the General,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>I refuse to respond, feeling it beneath my dignity to react to Lisutaris's ridiculous insinuation that I'd be jealous of anyone making a play for Makri. The pointy-eared barbarian can go off with anyone she likes, I'm not complaining.</p>
   <p>The quickest way to Arichdamis's house takes us through the narrow alley that separates the Jolly Bandit tavern from a blacksmith's forge. I'd like to call in at the Jolly Bandit but it's not the sort of place a woman of Lisutaris's status would want to be seen in. It might be the pang of remorse I feel on missing out on a refreshing beer that makes me careless. Or it might be because I'm not expecting anyone to be foolish enough to attack me while I'm with the Head of the Sorcerers Guild. Nevertheless, I'm taken by surprise when, a few yards along the alleyway, a small wooden door opens up and three men step out. Two of them have scarves hiding their features and the third is wearing a full-face helmet. They'll all carrying swords.</p>
   <p>«Hand over your money,» says the man in the helmet.</p>
   <p>By now my own sword is in my hand but I'm not expecting to fight. The alleyway is just wide enough for three people, which gives me room to step a little to the side, allowing Lisutaris to blast them with a spell. I half turn my head. Lisutaris is standing there, though she doesn't seem to producing any sorcery.</p>
   <p>«Would you» — I begin, but I don't get any further. The helmeted man lunges at me with his sword. I parry with the dagger in my left hand and thrust towards him but my strike is a little slow and he avoids it. Immediately the man on his left pushes forward with his blade and I have to deflect it and take a step back with my guard raised.</p>
   <p>«Now would be a good time for a spell!» I yell, but nothing happens. Instead the third man attempts to outflank me and and there's a loud clang of metal as I block his blade. Not far away the blacksmith is working at his forge and the clash of our weapons mingles with the sounds from his anvil. The thug with the helmet is now pressing me hard, I step inside his strike and allow our bodies almost to touch, then thrust my dagger into his arm. He gasps in pain and I push his body against the assailant on my left. Simultaneously I raise my sword, blocking the attacker on my right. As his blade is diverted towards the ground I raise mine and plant it firmly through his shoulder. He cries out, and drops his sword. I have time to kick him firmly in the legs for good measure, and he falls to the ground. The attacker on my left, undaunted, mounts a furious attack. I black his blade easily enough and when he draws it back to strike again, he leaves himself wide open. I plant my blade in his chest and it slices easily thought his leather jerkin and into his heart. He falls down dead at my feet. I turn, with my sword and dagger at the ready, but by now the man with the helmet has fled, still clutching the wound in his arm. The other thug picks himself up and runs after him along the alleyway.</p>
   <p>I turn angrily to Lisutaris. «What was that?» I demand.</p>
   <p>«What do you mean?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Why didn't you help me?»</p>
   <p>«I wanted to see how well you fought these days,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«You're always going on about sword-fighting, and Makri's technique, and how good you were. I just wanted to see if you still had it.»</p>
   <p>«I could have been killed!»</p>
   <p>«I'd have stepped in if you needed me.»</p>
   <p>I'm not finding this entirely satisfactory. «You can't just leave someone to fight three people because you're curious about their fighting technique! That's not what comrades do!»</p>
   <p>«Are we comrades?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«I thought we were.»</p>
   <p>«Really Thraxas, I think you're making too much of a fuss. Particularly as you did fight so well. I was impressed. Should we move on? Probably it wouldn't be good for my reputation to be discovered in this alleyway with a dead man at my feet.»</p>
   <p>I glare at her, exasperated. Before leaving I removed the assailant's scarf. It's no one I recognise, and there's nothing in his pockets to identify him. Even so, I'm fairly sure he was working for Big Bixo's business partner. That might even have been the man in the helmet, he looked of similar build. We hurry along, emerging from the alley into a broad thoroughfare that leads up to Arichdamis house. I'm still angry at Lisutaris for not helping me. This woman can bring down war dragons from the sky. She could have dealt with three armed thugs easily enough.</p>
   <p>«Are you still in a bad mood?» asks Lisutaris, airily.</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«I really don't see why. I was there if you needed me.»</p>
   <p>«What's the idea of saying you wanted to see what my sword-fighting technique was like? It makes it sound like I might have been lying about it.»</p>
   <p>«I wouldn't put it quite like that. Exaggerating, maybe. You are prone to that. Anyway, weren't you pleased to get some practice?»</p>
   <p>«Practice? I had to kill a man!»</p>
   <p>«Does that bother you?»</p>
   <p>«No,» I admit. «Not when he was trying to kill me.»</p>
   <p>We walk on in silence. We're almost at Arichdamis's house when Lisutaris next speaks. «I like the idea of being a comrade.»</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«<emphasis>Comrade</emphasis>. We don't use that word in the Sorcerers Guild. I rather like it. All in the struggle together. Would Makri count as a comrade as well?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so.»</p>
   <p>«Good. I must tell her what splendid technique you displayed. Really, none of your attackers came close to harming you.» Lisutaris reaches inside her magic purse and, to my surprise, brings out a large bottle of ale.</p>
   <p>«Where did you get that?»</p>
   <p>«I used a spell to whisk it out of the Jolly Bandit.»</p>
   <p>I open the bottle immediately and take a drink. «I'm still not pleased with you.»</p>
   <p>«You will be when you've finished it,» says Lisutaris.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Four</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Inside Arichdamis's house, I finish my beer, and I think. Mainly, I think I'd like another beer, but I give some consideration to Demelzos's daughter. Why is she in danger? She's been sitting around at home, being a dutiful daughter as far as anyone knows, without an enemy in the world. Suddenly her best friend is killed, and she's in danger. There's no reason for it. My enquiries have failed to come up with so much as a hint that she's involved in anything unusual. No disreputable lover. No secret business interest. No secrets at all, as far as I can learn.</p>
   <p>My thoughts turn to her family. I've only briefly encountered her brother. From all accounts he's a decent young man. He's about to marry well. Though perhaps not as well as he imagines, I reflect, remembering the financial difficulties Baron Vosanos finds himself in. This makes me frown. I don't like it that Vosanos is in financial difficulties. Financial difficulties lead to crime. But again, why pick on Merlione? It doesn't make any sense.</p>
   <p>I hunt in the cellar for more beer. There's none. Arichdamis is apparently refusing to restock his cellars while I'm still in residence. It's a poor way to treat a guest. I traipse back upstairs, suddenly afflicted by a great wave of melancholy. I should be sitting in the Avenging Axe, drinking beer and swapping war stories with Gurd. I miss Gurd, the old barbarian. I meet Lisutaris in the corridor.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas. Why the gloomy face?»</p>
   <p>«I miss Gurd. And the Avenging Axe. And drinking beer with my friends.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris manages to look more sympathetic than I'd have expected. «Share some wine with me,» she suggests.</p>
   <p>So acute is the melancholy that I'm unable even to pretend to be enthusiastic.</p>
   <p>«Am I that bad a substitute?» asks the Sorcerer.</p>
   <p>«You're not a bad substitute, Lisutaris. But I need beer in a tavern. And men to swap war stories with.»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress laughs, not unkindly. «I miss my old friends too,» she says. «You'd be surprised how many hours Tirini and I spent gossiping. But I've been in plenty of battles. So has Makri, come to that. Perhaps we could try swapping some reminiscences?»</p>
   <p>A key sounds in the front door. It's Makri. «Lisutaris! General Hemistos tried to kiss me! And he invited me back to his mansion for the night!»</p>
   <p>«What? Really? Tell me everything.» The Sorceress looks at me apologetically. «It looks like the war stories will have to wait.»</p>
   <p>«That's all right. It probably wouldn't have been the same anyway.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris and Makri go off to talk about the men in their lives. I retire to my room and lie on the bed, staring at the ceiling. I try to think about my investigation, but I keep losing concentration and thinking about Turai instead, and the Avenging Axe, and drinking with Gurd, and playing cards with Captain Rallee. It leads to me sleeping badly and waking early. I dress quickly and head out to the public baths for a long soak to set me up for the day. I have a busy schedule planned. First I intend to visit Baroness Demelzos for more information about her family's finances. After that I'll return to the King's Record House to carry on reading. I'll need to speak to Cetenos too, about the documents for Baron Vosanos's court case that seem to be missing. Later in the afternoon I have to be at the tournament field for Makri's next fight. Makri has been drawn against Parasas the Niojan, who beat her in the qualifying group. For once, she's eager to engage, determined to erase the memory of her humiliating defeat.</p>
   <p>On my way to the baths I run into Baron Girimos. He greets me genially. «Thraxas of Turai! You're a man with a decent appetite. Join me for breakfast?»</p>
   <p>I'm not going to refuse an offer of breakfast from a Baron, though I'm puzzled as to why the Baron would be wandering around Elath, apparently intending to eat in a tavern. Presumably, as a wealthy Baron, he has his own kitchens. The Baron soon lets me know his reasons. «You wouldn't believe the state of my house at this moment. Relatives everywhere. Wife's relations, mostly. Spongers to a man. Can't stand them myself, but you know what wives are like. Do you know what wives are like?»</p>
   <p>I tell the Baron that mine left me a long time ago.</p>
   <p>«Splendid news!» he exclaims. «Wish mine would take off, and take her relatives with her. I can't eat properly with these vultures at the table, it puts me off my food. Can't drink properly either, with my daughters tut-tutting every time I reach for a flagon.» The Baron comes to a halt, eyeing the establishment ahead of us. «The Jolly Bandit? What's this place like?»</p>
   <p>«Serves a good ale,» I tell him. «And not a bad beef pie.»</p>
   <p>«Excellent!» cries the Baron, and heads straight in. The Jolly Bandit might not be frequented by the highest class of customer, but Baron Girimos isn't going to let that stand in his way. At this time in the morning, the tavern is empty save for a woman wiping tables, and a man rolling a barrel of beer into position behind the bar.</p>
   <p>«We need food and drink immediately!» cries the Baron.</p>
   <p>«I'm sorry, we haven't opened»-</p>
   <p>The Baron takes out a purse and slams some gold coins onto the counter. «Two tankards of your famous ale, and as many beef pies as you can fit onto a plate,» says the Baron. «And I mean a large plate. Just pile them on a tray if you don't have one big enough.»</p>
   <p>The man behind the bar, scoops up the gold. «Right away,» he says, and begins shouting orders to some unseen figures in the kitchens beyond. I like this Baron a lot more than anyone else I've met in Samsarina. We take a table by a window, a solid piece of furniture designed to carry food and drink for the hungry man, and when the pies start arriving, we get to work. Baron Girimos downs his flagon of ale in one long gulp.</p>
   <p>«I hope you're not one of these people who thinks you shouldn't drink in the morning?» he says.</p>
   <p>«I've never seen any reason not to.»</p>
   <p>«That's what I told my daughter only yesterday!» cries the Baron. «But she wouldn't listen. Waiter, more ale. Have you any cold pheasant in the larder? No? Duck? That'll do fine. Send it along.»</p>
   <p>By this time, several waitresses are scurrying around, pressed into action by the unexpected arrival of a wealthy Baron. Bowls of steaming vegetables appear, along with bread, cheese and cold duck, Girimos having issued instructions to just bring everything as soon as it's ready.</p>
   <p>«Haven't eaten properly for a week,» he exclaims, tucking into a hefty portion. «Damned relatives all over the place.»</p>
   <p>I finish a second tankard of ale, take a temporary diversion through a bowl of buttered yams, and then get back to the beef pies.</p>
   <p>«That's not a bad pie,» says the Baron. «Plenty of beef. Satisfying. Not like these silly little things my wife gets from her fancy chef. Reminds me of the pies the quartermaster used to have when we were campaigning in Grykur. Man needs a good bit of food when there's dragons pouring out of the sky. Ever been in Grykur?»</p>
   <p>«I was there in the war,» I say. «Led my phalanx all the way over the Dragon-bone hills.»</p>
   <p>«I was in the Dragon-bone hills too!» says the Baron, enthusiastically. «I was a young officer. Not many Orcs could stand up to my cavalry battalion, I can tell you. But it was tough. I remember we were outnumbered four to one going up Blackwing Rise, and the order came in to retreat. 'What's that?' I said. 'Retreat? The Ninth Battalion of the Samsarinan Cavalry does not retreat!' I told the bugler to blow the advance — waitress, where's our ale? We're thirsty over here!»</p>
   <p>A waitress rushes over with two more large tankards. She departs smiling, thanks to the Baron's generous tip. «Keep the ale coming,» he calls after her. «Where was I? Ah yes, the bugler. I told him to sound the advance, and right that moment he took an arrow in the throat. Fell off his horse stone dead. So I picked up the bugle myself and sounded the charge. You should have seen us going up that hill! The Orcs fled when they saw us coming.»</p>
   <p>«I was on Blackwing Rise too!» I say. «On the south side, with the infantry.» I pick up the salt and pepper pots, and start manoeuvring them round the table, to illustrate our troop positions. «As I was leading the phalanx up the slope, the Fourth Orcish Regiment suddenly came over the hill, with a dragon behind them!» I pick up a small tumbler, to represent the Orcish forces, and start advancing the pepper pot.</p>
   <p>«I was here, with the cavalry,» says the Baron, picking up a spoon and placing it beside a fork which represents a group of Western Sorcerers.</p>
   <p>«Not that the Sorcerers were much help,» says the Baron.</p>
   <p>«They never are! All the hard work gets left to the soldiers.» I notice my tankard is empty and there seems to be a lack of pies on the table. I open my mouth to roar for more but the kitchen is now fully operational and waitresses are already heading our way. As the morning progresses, the table submerges under a mass of condiments and cutlery, as the Baron and I re-create the campaign in the Dragon-Bone Hills in Grykur, of which the battle of Blackwing Rise was but one of many stirring events, albeit one in which the heroic performance of my phalanx was noted far and wide. At some point in the proceedings the Baron is on his feet with a long loaf of bread in his hands, illustrating the best way to cut down an opponent on horseback, while I pick up a tray and use it as a shield, demonstrating the way I led my men against the elite troops of the Fourth Orcish Regiment. By now it's approaching lunchtime and the tavern has a few more customers, though we're not paying much attention to them.</p>
   <p>«What say we open a bottle of klee?» suggests the Baron. «Wash down some of this food before examining the desserts?»</p>
   <p>That sounds like an excellent idea. It's a long time since I've had a glass of klee, the strong, fiery spirit distilled all over the West. Quality can vary widely, but the proprietor of the Jolly Bandit brings us a bottle brewed by monks in the hills, and it's not bad at all.</p>
   <p>«Good klee!» says the Baron, banging his glass on the table. «Reminds me of a drop I had to drink right after we rode from Blackwing Rise to Sundread Valley. Were you in the valley?»</p>
   <p>«Led my phalanx right through it.»</p>
   <p>«Splendid!» cries the Baron. «Of course, we had to do a lot of fighting to let the infantry through.» «The Orcs were here» — «The Baron picks up the salt cellar,» — and we were here. And just as we were about to charge, damned if the biggest dragon you ever saw didn't come right down the valley with fire coming out of its mouth and a Sorcerer on board, blasting spells in every direction!</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Five</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I waken up in surprisingly good health, given my recent excesses. No sign of a hangover at all. Plenty of food, that's the secret. Mop up the excess beer with a goodly selection of pies and there's no problem. I look around me. I'm in my guest room at Arichdamis's. I cant remember how I got here. Must have walked, I suppose, after leaving the Jolly Bandit. What time is it? It's bright and sunny outside. Early afternoon, I'd say. Still time to make it up to the tournament field for Makri's fight. I've missed out on the investigating I planned for this morning, but I can visit Baroness Demelzos later.</p>
   <p>I haul myself upright and sit on the edge of the bed. I notice my clothes are damp. That's odd. Perhaps I spilled some water over myself while demonstrating my assault on the Orcish fort in Sundread valley. I do remember using a water pitcher for a mace at one point. Now feeling thirsty, I look around for my own water pitcher, but it's empty. I head for the kitchen. I'm filling up a large pewter beaker when Makri appears.</p>
   <p>«Hi Makri.»</p>
   <p>«Never speak to me again in any circumstances,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«What's the matter?»</p>
   <p>«I said never speak to me again.» Makri glares at me with loathing, and storms out of the kitchen. It's puzzling. But Makri's moods are often erratic. I can't see that I've done anything to upset her. Maybe she's still annoyed at Lasat's plans to cage the young dragon. I look down at my tunic, which is still quite damp. I notice it's also in need of repair. The neck is looking distinctly ragged. Probably I should do something about it, if only to not cause Lisutaris embarrassment. At that moment Lisutaris appears. I greet her amiably. She glares at me. I begin to wonder if I might have caused offence in some way.</p>
   <p>«Is there anything wrong?»</p>
   <p>«Anything wrong? Don't you know?»</p>
   <p>«Nothing springs to mind…»</p>
   <p>«You missed Makri's fight, for one thing!» says Lisutaris, loudly.</p>
   <p>I can make no sense of this. «What do you mean? She's not fighting till late afternoon.»</p>
   <p>«That was yesterday!»</p>
   <p>«No it wasn't, it's today.»</p>
   <p>«It was yesterday! You got drunk with Baron Girimos and went on a gigantic spree all through Elath, which ended up with the pair of you being thrown out of the King's Bathing House for creating a disturbance and frightening young bathers.»</p>
   <p>I stare at the Sorcerer. This all seems very unlikely. «I don't remember anything like that.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not surprised! You and the Baron called in at every tavern between the Jolly Bandit and the Bathing Houses, drinking klee and terrorising the barmaids. Eventually you ended up in the King's private hot pool, trying to re-enact some naval engagement. The whole episode is now the talk of Elath. The King is not pleased. And my status has now sunk to zero.»</p>
   <p>«Are you quite sure about all this?»</p>
   <p>«I was the one who bailed you out of the guardhouse. It took four men to lift you into my carriage.»</p>
   <p>«Oh.»</p>
   <p>There's an uncomfortable silence.</p>
   <p>«So I missed Makri's fight?»</p>
   <p>«You did.»</p>
   <p>«What happened?»</p>
   <p>«She won, no thanks to you. You weren't there to lead her into the arena. She had to ask General Hemistos, something she'd much rather not have done. What were you thinking about, spending the day getting roaringly drunk when you were meant to be attending to Makri? You knew how important that fight was to her. She was fighting Parasas, who beat her before.»</p>
   <p>I spread my hands wide. «I didn't plan it, it just happened. I left the house early to do some investigating and I ran into the Baron. Girimos has a very healthy thirst.»</p>
   <p>«So you couldn't even control yourself for a few hours?»</p>
   <p>While it's uncomfortable having the Head of the Sorcerers Guild so angry at me, I'm not about to give in without a fight. «You can't blame me,» I inform her, quite forcibly. «There are extenuating circumstances. Look at what I've had to put up with since we got here. Nothing but you and Makri talking about your romantic problems. If it's not Kublinos doing something you don't like, it's Makri complaining about General Hemistos. Just a constant barrage of things I don't want to hear about. It's no surprise I needed a day off with a good drinking companion.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shakes her head. «Thraxas, I can understand your need to make an utter pig of yourself occasionally, but could you not have waited? It was bad to miss Makri's fight. She's absolutely furious. So am I. Have you forgotten you were meant to be helping me repel hostile sorcery?»</p>
   <p>«Was there any hostile sorcery?»</p>
   <p>«I don't think so. I didn't detect any. Makri had a hard time though, it was a tough fight. Parasas dealt her some painful blows before she beat him.»</p>
   <p>«I'll make it up to her.»</p>
   <p>«I wouldn't bet on it. And talking of betting, I had to place our bet with Big Bixo. Yes, Thraxas, thanks to you, I have now suffered the unmatched humiliation of walking into a bookmaker's shop and placing a wager, something no Head of the Sorcerers Guild has ever done before, not even Julia the Bad, and she did most things. Word of this has also spread all round Elath, further destroying my reputation. I'm now the Sorcerer who's addicted to gambling and employs Turai's biggest drunkard as my Adviser.»</p>
   <p>«Was I really arrested?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. But they didn't take you to jail, because you were with the Baron. They just threw the two of you in the guardhouse and sent a messenger to me to pick you up.»</p>
   <p>I'm sure Lisutaris is exaggerating the whole thing. «If I was really as drunk as you claim, why am I feeling so healthy now?»</p>
   <p>«Because I used a <emphasis>Sleep and Regenerate</emphasis> spell on you. Partly because I was worried you'd actually die from klee-poisoning, and partly to stop you singing obscene drinking songs.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris fishes in her magic purse, and finally brings out my spell protection necklace. «Here, this belongs to you. I removed it before I used the spell.» Lisutaris digs around some more in her purse while I fasten the charm around my neck.</p>
   <p>«So what happened when you went to put the bet on?» I ask.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shudders at the memory. «There was some adverse comment. Not to my face, of course, but I could hear people whispering. When I reached the front of the queue, I wasn't even sure how to place the bet properly. It was all very embarrassing.»</p>
   <p>«What odds did you get?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris tells me that both fighters were listed at five to six. «Was that reasonable? Or was Bixo cheating me?»</p>
   <p>«It's all right, it's about what I'd have expected.»</p>
   <p>«Good. I wagered 5,000. I might have put on more, but Bixo said that was the most he would take. Is that fair?»</p>
   <p>I nod. «Bookmakers are like that. When you start winning they're suddenly not so keen to take your bets. They put a limit on.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris's 5000 guran bet has won us 4,167, making 9,167. With the 2,875 she kept back, we now have 12,042 gurans.</p>
   <p>«I've never been so successful at gambling before,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«At least something's going well. So now Makri's in the semi-final. When is it?»</p>
   <p>«This afternoon,» Lisutaris tells me. «And it's going to be difficult.»</p>
   <p>«Of course. Anyone who's made it this far will be a tough opponent.»</p>
   <p>«I don't just mean that. I've been wondering why Lasat hasn't been using more sorcery against Makri. I put some pressure on one of the junior Sorcerers here and he told me Lasat's been holding off, hoping Makri would lose in a fair fight. But she hasn't, so now he's going to make sure she doesn't get past the semi-final. We can expect a full scale assault, while the Tournament Sorcerer looks the other way. You'd better be prepared to deflect incoming spells.»</p>
   <p>«Isn't there some other way of dealing with this?» I say. «The King wouldn't be pleased to know the tournament's being magically disrupted. It's meant to be fair.»</p>
   <p>«I don't see what I can do about that. I can't go telling tales to the King. It'll look like I'm scared of Lasat.»</p>
   <p>We leave the kitchen. Makri is waiting in the corridor, standing in front of a marble bust of Saint Quatinius. It's hard to say which one looks angriest.</p>
   <p>«Makri, I'm sorry I» —</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris, we'll have to leave for the fight a few minutes early. General Hemistos is meeting us at the bookmaker's. He'll put our bet on for us, and lead me into the arena. If you happen to see that fat, drunken oaf, Thraxas, and he's sober enough to talk — which is unlikely — tell him not to bother showing up. I don't want my reputation sullied.»</p>
   <p>Makri departs. Lisutaris looks at me. «Makri's as angry as a troll with a toothache. You'd better do something about it.»</p>
   <p>«Don't you think it's going a bit far, accusing me of sullying her reputation? Orcish gladiators don't have reputations to sully.»</p>
   <p>«I don't know about that,» says Lisutaris. «Makri's gaining quite a following. She fights well. She behaves properly when there are Barons around, out of respect to me. She doesn't invade the King's Royal Bathing House, bellowing insults about the Samsarinan army.»</p>
   <p>«They never could fight. Don't worry about Makri, I know her weaknesses. I'll pacify her.»</p>
   <p>Later, on my way to visit Baroness Demelzos, I walk past the Jolly Bandit. I wouldn't mind a beer to set me up for the day, but decide I'd better not risk it. There's no knowing what might happen. At the Baroness's mansion, I have to wait quite a while before being led into her reception rooms. The Baroness greets me cooly.</p>
   <p>«I thought you were coming to visit me yesterday. I waited for several hours.»</p>
   <p>«Other matters intervened,» I explain. «Important new leads in the investigation.»</p>
   <p>«Really? I thought it might have had something to do with your all-day drinking session with Baron Girimos.»</p>
   <p>«You heard about that?»</p>
   <p>«Everyone's heard about it,» says the Baroness. «My Chief Steward was in the King's Bathing House when you stumbled in, brandishing a stick. His report was extremely graphic.»</p>
   <p>«Well, it was really Baron Girimos who was doing most of the» —</p>
   <p>«And my kitchen maid encountered you outside the Jolly Bandit. Was it you or the Baron who offered her fifty gurans for a night's whoring?»</p>
   <p>«It must have been the Baron. I don't have that sort of money.»</p>
   <p>«As for my pastry-cook, she saw you» —</p>
   <p>«Is there any member of your household who didn't spend the entire day spying on me? Don't they have better things to do?»</p>
   <p>Baroness Demelzos suddenly laughs, quite heartily. «I was hoping you hadn't lost your touch, Thraxas. You always were entertaining, back in the old days.» The Baroness pours wine into a goblet from a silver decanter and passes it to me. I take a seat opposite her at the table. She asks me if I've made any progress.</p>
   <p>«Some. Can you tell me more about your finances?»</p>
   <p>«How do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«I've heard you're not doing so well.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness frowns. «That's not exactly polite. And not relevant, as far as I can see.»</p>
   <p>«I've been down all the relevant paths. They didn't lead anywhere. I'm broadening my enquiries.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos purses her lips. «It's true we've had some reverses. My husband did lose money in bad shipping transactions. Some of it was bad luck. Some of it was bad business. Does that satisfy you?»</p>
   <p>«Did you know Baron Vosanos is in difficulty too?»</p>
   <p>«I find that hard to believe. Vosanos is one of Samsarina's wealthiest men.»</p>
   <p>«Not any more, he isn't. He owes tax to the King. He's trying to keep it quiet but it's true.»</p>
   <p>«That's interesting,» says the Baroness. «But you said he was in difficulty <emphasis>too</emphasis>. That's inaccurate. My family might have lost money but we're not in difficulty. My husbands financial misfortunes haven't affected our queenstone mines. They still provide a good income. That's why we settled one of the mines on Orgodas for his wedding.»</p>
   <p>«What do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«Our son gets the mine as his wedding gift from us. Vosanos will settle something equally valuable on his daughter. Or perhaps not, if what you say is true.» The Baroness sips her wine, elegantly, like Lisutaris. «Why does this matter?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know.»</p>
   <p>«None of it seems to affect my daughter.»</p>
   <p>«Can she interfere with the wedding gift?»</p>
   <p>«Of course not. My husband owns all our property, under the law. He can transfer our mines to whoever he chooses. Orgodas will inherit it all eventually, anyway.»</p>
   <p>«Does it bother you that you brought all the money into the family and now your husband controls it?»</p>
   <p>«That's the law in Samsarina,» says the Baroness.</p>
   <p>«I know. But does it bother you?»</p>
   <p>«I'd rather not say,» replies the Baroness.</p>
   <p>«Dos it bother Merlione that Orgodas will inherit everything?»</p>
   <p>«She'll be provided for. We won't just abandon our daughter. I can't see that she'd mind that Orgodas will inherit. That's what always happens. I'm not enjoying answering these questions.»</p>
   <p>«Most of my clients feel that way at some point.»</p>
   <p>«You know that several Barons have complained to my husband about you questioning their servants?»</p>
   <p>«Barons can complain all they like. You hired me to help Merlione. That's what I'm doing.»</p>
   <p>«My husband insists you abandon the investigation.»</p>
   <p>«And?»</p>
   <p>«I insist that you don't.»</p>
   <p>I sip my wine. I like Demelzos. I wish I had some better ideas for helping.</p>
   <p>«How are you going to make things up to Makri?» she asks, unexpectedly.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«I understand she's insulted you weren't there to lead her into the arena.»</p>
   <p>I stare at Demelzos, surprised. «How could you possibly know that?»</p>
   <p>«My kitchen maid is walking out with General Hemistos's stable boy. She brings home a lot of gossip.»</p>
   <p>I shouldn't be surprised. Servants usually know everything. «I thought I'd buy her flowers.»</p>
   <p>«Flowers?» Demelzos raised her eyebrows slightly. «That doesn't seem like enough.»</p>
   <p>«Makri is very susceptible to flowers. She grew up in a gladiator slave pit and never got any presents. A bunch of flowers can have a powerful effect.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness nods. «I can understand that. I take it you've done this before?»</p>
   <p>«Several times.»</p>
   <p>«This time you might need something better. Here» — The Baroness takes a small object from a drawer and slides it over the table. It's a notebook, I suppose, though calling it that doesn't really do it justice. The pages are made from the highest-grade vellum and it's bound in black leather, with a small queenstone jewel set in the centre, and a silver clasp to hold it shut. I doubt if even Lisutaris has anything quite this fancy to write in.</p>
   <p>«You said she likes to study. Does she have anything nice for taking notes?»</p>
   <p>«No one has anything this nice for taking notes.»</p>
   <p>«Give it to her,» says the Baroness. «She'll forgive your offensive behaviour.»</p>
   <p>I look at her suspiciously. «Why would you care about that?»</p>
   <p>«I don't like to see things go badly between you and your young lady.»</p>
   <p>«Makri is not my young lady.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness laughs. «Really? Then why have you been buying her flowers?»</p>
   <p>«Unfortunate circumstances which are difficult to describe.»</p>
   <p>«How many women have you ever bought flowers for?»</p>
   <p>«None. But you've got entirely the wrong impression.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness looks amused. It's annoying. I thank her for the book, and tell her I'd like to talk to Merlione before I leave.</p>
   <p>«She should be in her rooms. I'll have a servant take you. It would be best if you were quick. My husband will probably be home soon. Do I owe you any more money? The retainer only covered a few days.»</p>
   <p>«It doesn't matter. You lent me more money for gambling.»</p>
   <p>«How's that going?»</p>
   <p>«Well.»</p>
   <p>I follow Demelzos's servant though the long, white-plastered walls of her summer mansion, wondering what's got into me that I'm refusing money from a client. I glance at the book I'm carrying. Makri will probably try and break it over my head.</p>
   <p>Here in her her own rooms, safe from stray arrows and death threats, Merlione is again the confident young woman I first encountered. There's no hint of discomfort in her eyes as she greets me. I suddenly find that irritating. Everyone else is discomfited, why shouldn't she be?</p>
   <p>«What aren't you telling me?» I ask her.</p>
   <p>«Pardon?»</p>
   <p>«There's something about this affair you're not telling me. I want to know what it is.»</p>
   <p>«Why would I be withholding anything?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. Why don't you tell me?»</p>
   <p>«It sounds like you think I'm lying,» says Merlione.</p>
   <p>«You could put it that way if you want. So what are you lying about?»</p>
   <p>Merlione's dark eyes flash with anger. «This is ridiculous,» she says. «What sort of investigator are you? I'm the one who's being threatened.»</p>
   <p>«I think you have an idea why.»</p>
   <p>«No I don't.»</p>
   <p>«I've been down all the usual channels, Merlione. Lovers, rivals, finances, family feuds, blackmail. No one's telling me anything. People don't get murdered for no reason. Well, not Baron's daughters anyway. Someone has a reason for trying to kill you and I'm starting to think you know what it is.»</p>
   <p>«I don't.»</p>
   <p>«You're lying.»</p>
   <p>Merlione's cheeks flush with anger. At least I've discomfited her. «Perhaps you're just not a very good investigator.»</p>
   <p>«I'm number one chariot at investigating. Everyone says so. Tell me what you know.»</p>
   <p>«I don't know anything.»</p>
   <p>«Do you mind that your brother inherits everything and you get nothing?»</p>
   <p>Merlione looks at me in surprise. «What? Why would I?»</p>
   <p>«Why wouldn't you? It's your mother's Queenstone mines that are keeping the family going. Now she's giving one to Orgodas for his wedding. And when your father dies Orgodas will inherit the rest. Does that make you angry?»</p>
   <p>«What if it did?» Merlione's voice is raised. She's angry all right, though mostly at me. «What does this have to do with anything?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know. Maybe it's a clue. Tell me about it.»</p>
   <p>«It seems my father was right about you,» says Merlione, regaining her composure. «You have no skills at all. You should leave.»</p>
   <p>I stare at her for a long moment, then turn round and walk out the reception room. In the hall outside there's a portrait of her father, in full military uniform. It's a poor painting. Samsarinans have never been any good at art. I'm starting to dislike them as much as Simnians.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Six</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>As soon as I arrive back at Arichdamis's house, I sense sorcery. Perhaps Lisutaris is practicing. If she ever practices, that is; I'm not certain. Maybe it all comes easily and she doesn't have to. Arichdamis appears in the corridor, trudging mournfully towards the front door. It's a while since I've seen the old mathematician looking happy. Having house guests doesn't seem to agree with him.</p>
   <p>«Sorcerers,» he mutters, as he passes me. «Always arguing.»</p>
   <p>«Who's arguing?»</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris and Lasat. And Charius. I don't like any of them.»</p>
   <p>«Is Makri around?»</p>
   <p>«She's arguing too.» The mathematician regards me wearily. «Have you found my plans for the crossbow?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«I'm ruined,» he groans.</p>
   <p>«I wouldn't put it that strongly. You can draw up another set.»</p>
   <p>«The complex mathematics involved makes that a lengthy task,» he tells me. «And for what? I'll still be disgraced when it's learned they were stolen from my house.»</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris will be disgraced too.»</p>
   <p>«As she deserves,» says Arichdamis, and sounds cross. «If she'd only been able to control her unnatural appetite for thazis, they wouldn't have disappeared in the first place.»</p>
   <p>«Don't worry, we'll find your plans.»</p>
   <p>Arichdamis doesn't look convinced, and shakes his head sadly before leaving. As soon as he's gone, a tremendous commotion breaks out at the far end of the house. Voices are raised and doors slam. I recognise Makri's voice and I'm surprised to discover she's shouting at Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Why did you drag me away?»</p>
   <p>«Because it's not something we can argue with Lasat about.»</p>
   <p>«Why not?»</p>
   <p>«The dragon has to be caged!» says Lisutaris. «What else is the King going do? Let it fly around?»</p>
   <p>«He shouldn't have brought it here in the first place if he was going to put it in a cage,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«I really don't see what your objection is. Lasat has to work these spells to contain it.»</p>
   <p>«It's not appropriate.» Makri sounds very unhappy.</p>
   <p>«Not appropriate? What <emphasis>is</emphasis> appropriate for a dragon? The only other times I've encountered them I've been trying to kill them. So have you.»</p>
   <p>«I don't care,» says Makri. «I don't like it.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris finally notices my presence. «Thraxas! Can you make any sense of this?»</p>
   <p>«Of course.»</p>
   <p>«You can?»</p>
   <p>«Makri doesn't like to see some noble wild beast thrown in a cage. It reminds her of her own upbringing.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris pauses, and looks surprised at my insight. Makri glowers at me. «I told you never to talk to me again,» she mutters.</p>
   <p>I'm ready for this, and whip Demelzos's fancy notebook from the pocket of my tunic. The queenstone jewel in the cover glints in the sunlight that's streaming through the back door. «I'm sorry I wasn't there to lead you into the tournament field. I brought you this.»</p>
   <p>I hand the book to Makri, who stares at it, puzzled.</p>
   <p>«Highest-quality vellum,» I add. «Excellent for taking notes during your intellectual pursuits.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks at the jewel set in the cover, then undoes the silver clasp to examine the notebook. It really is a fine item. The wealthiest student at the best university in the West wouldn't have anything better. Makri abruptly bursts into tears and runs out the room, something which does not entirely surprise me. Lisutaris, on the other hand, is baffled.</p>
   <p>«What just happened?» she asks.</p>
   <p>«I just made things up with Makri. I told you it would be all right.»</p>
   <p>«How did you make things up?»</p>
   <p>«With a well-chosen gift. Makri is very susceptible to gifts. Because of her background, you see.» I'm pleased with myself, and let it show. «Of course, not any old gift will do. It has to be right. I spent a long time hunting round Elath, looking for something special. Must have been in twenty shops before I found that notebook.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shakes her head. «There's something not quite right about this.»</p>
   <p>«I don't know what you mean.»</p>
   <p>«I mean that you upsetting Makri with your appalling behaviour and then getting away with it just by handing her a present doesn't seem fair, somehow. I'm sure you don't deserve to be in the clear.»</p>
   <p>«Well,» I say, reaching into the small bag I'm carrying. «I may make the occasional blunder. But Thraxas of Turai is always willing to admit his mistakes, and rectify them. Back in Twelve Seas, I was well-known for my tact. Here, I brought you these.» I hand a bunch of flowers to Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Flowers?»</p>
   <p>«To apologise for your inconvenience in having to visit Big Bixo's betting shop.»</p>
   <p>«I hope you're not expecting me to start crying.»</p>
   <p>«Of course not. The flowers are merely a small token of apology, and a sign of the tremendous esteem in which I hold you.»</p>
   <p>«Oh.» Lisutaris seems quite taken aback. «Well thank you. I'll put them in water.»</p>
   <p>«You're welcome.» I make a swift retreat, while I'm on top. All in all, it's been a successful morning. One moment the house is full of women who are angry at Thraxas. Next moment, everything is rosy. Who would have guessed, back in Turai, when Tanrose first told me that buying Makri flowers would have positive results, that the same tactic would prove so useful in the future? I'd never have stumbled on the idea myself.</p>
   <p>After my busy morning, I could do with some rest. I retire to my room, remove my boots, lie down, drag the cover over me, and sink into a refreshing sleep.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Later in the day, as we make ready to leave, harmony has almost returned to the household. Lisutaris has her hand on Makri's shoulder, casting a minor healing spell on one of the many bruises she's picked up during the tournament. Lisutaris doesn't specialise in healing but she's quite capable of dealing with most injuries. Treating Makri's wounds with sorcery is allowed under tournament rules, providing any spell used has worn off by the time the fighters enter the ring.</p>
   <p>«Not that anyone seems to be caring much about the rules any more,» says Lisutaris. «I'm expecting Lasat and his cohorts to go all out to stop Makri today.»</p>
   <p>I agree. Lasat won't want to risk Makri reaching the final, and facing Elupus. Lisutaris again gives me the spell of deflection, to help her hold off enemy sorcery.</p>
   <p>«If the Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild really makes a mass attack, it's going to be difficult to hold them off,» I say.</p>
   <p>«I know. But Makri's got a good spell protection necklace, it's not that easy to hit her. We might be able to protect her.»</p>
   <p>I'm still not looking forward to the Sorcerous barrage I'm letting myself in for. I have another plan of action already ticking over in my head, though I'm not going to mention it to Lisutaris. Makri's opponent in the semi-final is Bhuralin, a swordsman from Kamara, north west of Samsarina. I've seen him fight and I was impressed by his technique. Makri picks up her sword and shield.</p>
   <p>«Thanks for the notebook.»</p>
   <p>«You're welcome.»</p>
   <p>«But I wasn't crying because of that,» says Makri. «I was just upset about the dragon.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris's carriage is outside. As always, there's a gang of children and a few older youths hanging around, gawking at Makri. I hang back for a few moments, talking to them. Then we ride towards the edge of town, where the crowd is already dense as the tournament nears its climax. Both semi-finals will be held in the late afternoon and the final will take place at midnight, by torchlight. After that there's drinking, dancing and feasting round bonfires. I'm looking forward to the drinking and feasting. I haven't felt the urge to dance for a while.</p>
   <p>«Makri, do you know how queenstone got its name?»</p>
   <p>«It's said it was named after Queen Eferinis.»</p>
   <p>«Wasn't she just a legend?»</p>
   <p>«The stories about her are semi-legendary, but my old history professor thought she probably did exist. She was meant to have discovered queenstone in the Samsarinan mountains with her sorcery. She gave it to her daughters so they were splendidly arrayed when the Star-God's sons came to visit. That part's probably legendary.»</p>
   <p>There are so many people converging on the tournament that we're unable to drive the whole way, and have to get out of the carriage and walk. We pass an impressive bonfire, beside a line of spits for roasting beef.</p>
   <p>«Best bit of the whole event,» I say. «Free food.»</p>
   <p>Minstrels wander through the crowd. It's a cheerful scene, though once again I can sense the air of abandonment that takes hold when war is just around the corner. Young couples dance, holding onto each other as if it's the last chance they'll ever get. As well as the revellers, there are a lot of Sorcerers present. Lasat Axe of Gold has brought his Guild out in force. Lisutaris accompanies Makri to her changing room. Someone taps me on the shoulder. It's Kublinos.</p>
   <p>«I hear you've been sneaking round Lisutaris again,» he says.</p>
   <p>«I don't need to sneak around her. I'm her adviser and we live in the same house.»</p>
   <p>«Her adviser? Does that normally include bringing her flowers?»</p>
   <p>I sigh. I should have known he'd soon learn about that. Arichdamis's servants are no doubt as keen on gossiping as everyone else. «Kublinos, I'm fed up with this. I have no romantic interest in Lisutaris. Not that it makes the slightest difference, because she'd never go for a fop like you anyway, with your fancy cloak and that ridiculous necklace. Do you think Lisutaris would be interested in some overdressed puppy who's never even been to war?»</p>
   <p>Kublinos glares at me with loathing. «How dare you speak to me like that! I am a senior Sorcerer!»</p>
   <p>«Turai had a better Sorcerer than you in every tavern.»</p>
   <p>Kublinos expression becomes even grimmer. «You will regret this,» he says. «You are now my enemy for life.» With that, he disappears into the crowd. A bit over-dramatic, I'd say, but probably what you'd expect from a Samsarinan Sorcerer who prances round in a fancy cloak.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris and Makri appear. Makri has a new breastplate, courtesy of General Hemistos, along with her new sword, both of superior quality. Good quality equipment or not, she still looks small in comparison to Bhuralin of Kamara, another very large swordsman. It's going to be a tough fight, particularly if the Samsarinan Sorcerers get involved. Even if she gets past Bhuralin, she still has to fight Elupus. I'm suddenly gripped by the feeling that this whole enterprise might not have been fair on Makri.</p>
   <p>«Do you want to do this?» I ask her.</p>
   <p>«What do you mean?»</p>
   <p>«You've had too many fights already. Maybe you should just stop now.»</p>
   <p>«I can't stop,» protests Makri. «Lisutaris needs me to win.»</p>
   <p>«Lasat needs you to lose. The semi-final's going to be tough. The Marshals aren't so picky about illegal blows. More or less anything goes. If some Samsarinan Sorcerer manages to get a good spell onto your opponents sword, he's liable to take your head off.»</p>
   <p>«No one's taking my head off,» declares Makri. «Lisutaris, tell Thraxas he's talking nonsense.»</p>
   <p>«I think Thraxas may be right,» says Lisutaris, surprising us. «You're had a lot of fights. When I encouraged you to enter the competition, I didn't realise it was so dangerous. Maybe we should just call it a day.»</p>
   <p>«But you'd lose 10,000 gurans to Lasat.»</p>
   <p>«We can afford it. We've got more than 12,000 already.»</p>
   <p>«But Lasat will be War Leader!»</p>
   <p>«Perhaps. Perhaps not. We can come up with another way of boosting my status.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks from Lisutaris to me, and back to Lisutaris. «I need to fight,» she says. «I can't give in. I'd never feel right again.»</p>
   <p>«Very well,» says Lisutaris. She looks around her. «Has anyone seen Kublinos? He was meant to meet me here.»</p>
   <p>«I may have scared him off,» I admit. «Also, he's declared me his enemy for life.»</p>
   <p>«How did that happen? We were only gone five minutes.»</p>
   <p>«I have a talent for offending people.»</p>
   <p>«Couldn't you have waited?» says Lisutaris. «I was hoping he'd give me information on Lasat's plans.»</p>
   <p>«That probably won't happen now. I'm off to place our bet. Bixo's going to regret he ever met me.»</p>
   <p>«He already does,» says Lisutaris. «Didn't he send these men to kill you?»</p>
   <p>«Possibly. Though I don't have any proof he was behind it.»</p>
   <p>Despite Makri's impressive performances, she isn't favourite for the fight. She's quoted at evens. Her opponent, Bhuralin of Kamara, is eight to eleven. That might be because Bhuralin has already won a few smaller tournaments, and people have been talking about him as a potential challenger to Elupus. But I wonder if word has leaked out to the public that the Samsarinan Sorcerers are going to sabotage Makri. That would certainly make her a less attractive proposition to bet on.</p>
   <p>As before, Bixo won't take a bet of more than 5000 gurans. I place this on Makri, then travel the short distance to Generous Ges's shop, and do the same again. I hurry back to the tournament, just in time to lead Makri out onto the field. Her reception is noisy, but still mostly hostile. Bhuralin gets a far better ovation. He's tall and broad, with some very noticeable scarring down one side of his face. He strides out confidently, looking like a young fighter on the way up, which he is.</p>
   <p>As the Marshal prepares to start the fight I leave the field quickly. Already my senses are tingling. Now that I'm carrying Lisutaris's spell, I can feel sorcery everywhere. I take up position next to her. Lasat is not too far away, standing with Charius and two more of their Guild. Other rainbow cloaks can be seen all round the arena. The Marshal drops his flag. Bhuralin and Makri advance slowly toward each other. A great roar goes up from the crowd. Immediately I sense a spell heading towards Makri and try to deflect it. This causes the spell to hit me in the face and knock me over. I get to my feet, yelling angrily, to find Bhuralin retreating, having lost his footing. Lisutaris seems to have got a spell of her own in, perhaps as a result of me having taken the brunt of the attack. Makri closes with Bhuralin but as her blade flickers over the top of his shield she herself loses her footing, and stumbles backwards.</p>
   <p>«Damn,» mutters Lisutaris. Her fingers are twitching, as she tries to locate and deflect the huge amount of Samsarinan sorcery now flying around the arena. I sense another attack and manage to bring Lisutaris's spell into action, deflecting the bolt of sorcery away from Makri, but the effort sends me reeling backwards into the man behind me, who curses me for my clumsiness. So far I've taken two mighty blows, which is more than either of the combatants have, as they struggle to come grips with the other. People in the crowd are starting to wonder out loud just what is happening. Makri thrusts her sword at Bhuralin but the blade stops in mid-air, impossibly, and Makri is jarred backwards.</p>
   <p>Suddenly a tomato flies over the crowd and hits Lasat in the face. To my great satisfaction, the tomato is immediately followed by several heavy yams. Charius the Wise finds himself assailed by a barrage of apples. The scene is repeated all around the arena, as every Samsarinan Sorcerer comes under attack from a hail of fruit and vegetables. There's some laughter from the crowd, even as Makri and Bhuralin continue their struggle</p>
   <p>«What's going on?» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«My back-up plan,» I explain. «I bribed the children.»</p>
   <p>It cost me forty gurans, which was more than I expected, but the youth in charge drove quite a hard bargain. Having said that, there's no denying he's organised things well. Children dart in and out of the huge crowd, armed with an assortment of yams, apples, cabbages and tomatoes, continually pelting the Samsarinan Sorcerers. The Sorcerers find themselves in an awkward position. They can't blast Samsarinan children with lethal spells. Even warding them off is difficult, given that there are people everywhere, and any spell directed at the children is bound to hit members of the crowd too.</p>
   <p>«Now the fight will be fair,» I say.</p>
   <p>«To hell with that,» mutters Lisutaris. She opens her palm, whispers a word, and discretely sends a spell into the arena. Bhuralin's shield drops out of position. Makri is on him in a flash. As her sword connects with his neck he crashes to the ground and his helmet flies off. Makri stands over him with her sword point at his throat.</p>
   <p>«Lethal Stroke,» says the Marshal.</p>
   <p>«Never tell Makri I did that,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>By now there is a scene of incredible chaos all around. Children are screaming and laughing as they run through the crowd, still throwing fruit. Sorcerers are yelling and running after them. Stewards pursue them all, with little success, as the children dart through tiny gaps where they can't be followed. Seeing their ragged little bodies go, and examining the mayhem they've wrought, I'm satisfied that my forty guran bribe was money well-spent. Lisutaris and I stroll into the arena to escort Makri from the field.</p>
   <p>«What's going on?» demands Makri.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas set a gang on children on the Sorcerers.»</p>
   <p>«I kept getting knocked around,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«There was a lot of sorcery coming in your direction,» explains Lisutaris. «I couldn't deflect it all.»</p>
   <p>«I took several mighty blows in your defence,» I say. «But you're welcome. You don't have to thank me.»</p>
   <p>«Did I win the fight fairly?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Of course,» replies Lisutaris, who, I have noticed, is a very smooth liar, when not addled by thazis. «Once the Sorcerers were out the picture I let things take their course.»</p>
   <p>«I will report this outrage to the King!» screams a voice in my ear. It's Lasat Axe of Gold. With his face sporting several bruises, and the remains of four or five rotten tomatoes still clinging to his rainbow cloak, he's not looking very impressive.</p>
   <p>«What outrage?» I ask.</p>
   <p>«These infernal children!»</p>
   <p>I laugh, good-naturedly. «I did notice the little scamps running around. Children will have their fun.»</p>
   <p>«They pelted me with fruit and vegetables!»</p>
   <p>«And me!» cries Charius, arriving in an even worse state than Lasat. «It's an intolerable affront!»</p>
   <p>«They never came near me,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Of course not,» I say. «You're Head of the Guild. They respect you.»</p>
   <p>«I know you were behind this!» yells Lasat.</p>
   <p>«I know nothing about it,» says Lisutaris, calmly.</p>
   <p>«I intend to give a full report to the King.»</p>
   <p>«Report what?» I ask. «That the children interfered with your illegal attempt to sabotage Makri?»</p>
   <p>Several more fruit-splattered Samsarina Sorcerers arrive, none of them looking happy. Things are threatening to get out of hand when Baron Mabados strides into our midst.</p>
   <p>«Silence!» he roars. «As Baron responsible for this tournament, I'm not happy about these events. And neither is the King.» The Baron looks at both Lisutaris and Lasat. «The King has called a meeting, to be held before the final.»</p>
   <p>«I shall be happy to attend,» says Lasat. «There is much the King needs to know about our Turanian visitors.»</p>
   <p>Lasat turns on his heel and walks off with as much dignity as he can muster, given the amount of fruit and vegetables still clinging to his apparel. I leave the field with Makri and Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«Well, this is it,» says Lisutaris. «Lasat is going to tell the King we've lost Arichdamis's plans. He's just been waiting for a good opportunity to announce it.»</p>
   <p>«If he does, just deny it,» suggests Makri.</p>
   <p>«How can I, if he produces them? I'm going to be completely discredited.»</p>
   <p>«Cheer up,» I say. «We've coped with worse. And we've just won another 10,000 gurans. Didn't I tell you I was the finest gambler in Turai?»</p>
   <p>Makri laughs. «It was funny seeing Lasat covered in fruit.» Lisutaris laughs too, and so do I. It was funny, and it's generally agreed that as plans go, mine was particularly effective.</p>
   <p>«But we won't get away with that again,» says Lisutaris. «The final is going to be tough.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Seven</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>Makri and I head towards Big Bixo's. All around, festivities are gathering pace, in readiness for the midnight finale.</p>
   <p>«Makri, you see that man walking past the beer tent?»</p>
   <p>«The one with the bandage on his arm?»</p>
   <p>«That's one of the men who attacked me in the alley. He had a helmet on but I recognise his red hair. And his wound. Are you up for some action?»</p>
   <p>«Of course. Are we going to kill him?»</p>
   <p>«Not right away. I want to know who sent him after me.»</p>
   <p>We follow the man at a distance as he walks past a row of tents, slowly making his way from the festival towards the town.</p>
   <p>«So you're going to ask him questions?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>Makri comes to a halt. «I'm not doing it.»</p>
   <p>«What do you mean <emphasis>you're not doing it</emphasis>?»</p>
   <p>«I know what you have in mind. You want me to play <emphasis>Orc Demon Woman</emphasis> so he'll be frightened.»</p>
   <p>«Does that bother you?»</p>
   <p>«You know it bothers me! It's demeaning.»</p>
   <p>«Come on Makri, you've done it before. Just make sure your pointy ears are showing, and you have that crazy look in your eyes. Yes, like that, that's good. Now hurry up of we'll lose him.»</p>
   <p>We catch up with our prey on the dark path between the last tents and the first building of Elath, managing to take him completely by surprise. I grab him and bundle him behind a tree, then draw my sword.</p>
   <p>«You tried to kill me,» I say. «I want to know why.»</p>
   <p>«Go to hell.»</p>
   <p>The man takes a step, as if to flee, but I put my sword at his chest. «Were you working for Big Bixo?»</p>
   <p>He looks at me defiantly. «I'm not telling you anything, fat man.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe you'd like my sword in your heart?»</p>
   <p>«You're not going to do that, Turanian dog. Not while you're working for Lisutaris. You can't get her into trouble, can you?»</p>
   <p>He has a point. I wasn't expecting him to be so well-informed.</p>
   <p>«I might not do it,» I tell him. «But she certainly will.»</p>
   <p>On cue, Makri appears from behind the tree. Her long, thick hair is dishevelled, matted over her face and shoulders, and she has a crazed look in her eyes. She draws her black Orcish sword. It's a dark, ugly weapon. Rather than reflecting light, it seems to suck it in. With one swift movement she grabs the man's hair and places the edge of her sword at his throat. «This sword was forged by demons in an Orcish furnace beneath the cursed mountain of Zarax,» she snarls. «It'll drink your soul and send you down to Orcish hell. The legion of the Orcish-damned will torture you forever.»</p>
   <p>Makri uses her other hand to sweep her hair back. «You see these ears? They grow sharper with each human soul I drink! Die, Human, and meet the Orcish Dead!»</p>
   <p>Makri raise her sword. The man cries out in fear. «Don't let her kill me! Magranos sent me after you!»</p>
   <p>«Who's Magranos?»</p>
   <p>«Chief Steward to Baron Vosanos.»</p>
   <p>«Why did he send you?»</p>
   <p>«I don't know? He just wanted you dead! Get me away from this demon!»</p>
   <p>I nod to Makri. She sheathes her sword. The man takes off at a run and disappears without looking back.</p>
   <p>«Good job scaring him,» I tell Makri. «Messing up your hair was a nice touch.»</p>
   <p>«It's so humiliating,» she says. «I don't even believe in Orcish Hell.» We walk on. «So what did you learn?»</p>
   <p>«I'm not sure. Magranos, Chief Steward to Baron Vosanos? Why would the Baron want me out the way?»</p>
   <p>«His daughter is marrying Demelzos's son, isn't he?»</p>
   <p>«He is. And it sounds like he doesn't like me poking around.» I notice Makri hasn't sheathed her sword, which is unusual. She normally keeps it covered. The mere sight of the foul Orcish blade can cause anger and revulsion in the West. «Why are you looking at your sword?»</p>
   <p>«I'm wondering about its powers. It can't really send anyone to Orcish Hell, but it is strong. It <emphasis>was</emphasis> forged under Mount Zarax. The Orcs say blades from that furnace can cut through anything, even objects protected by sorcery.» Makri unsheathes her second sword, a bright silver blade from the Elvish Isles. «Don't Elvish swords have some powers over sorcery too?»</p>
   <p>«Where is this conversation going?»</p>
   <p>«Nowhere,» says Makri, sheathing her swords. «I was just wondering.»</p>
   <p>I look at her suspiciously. «Are you planning on destroying something sorcerous?»</p>
   <p>«No.»</p>
   <p>«Well make sure you don't. We're already in enough trouble.»</p>
   <p>Makri sheathes her swords. The Elvish blade was a gift from the Elves on Avula, and as for the Orcish sword, she either won it as a gladiator, or looted it when she slaughtered everyone while making her escape from the East. I'm not sure which. She'll have another fine blade if she wins the tournament, as part of her prize.</p>
   <p>Arichdamis's house is empty. All the servants have gone to the festival. I round up some food from the cellars. It's now early evening.</p>
   <p>«Look,» says Makri. «I found you a beer in the kitchen.»</p>
   <p>I accept it gratefully.</p>
   <p>«You should sleep,» she says.</p>
   <p>«I don't think we have time. Lisutaris is meeting the King. We should be there. And we've still got to visit Big Bixo before the final.»</p>
   <p>«There's enough time,» says Makri. «I'll wake you.»</p>
   <p>I look at Makri, then shrug, and lie down on the couch where I doze peacefully for a while. When Makri shakes me awake it's dark outside. I yawn, stretch, and buckle on my sword before we make the return journey. Though Elath is now dark, there's a glow coming from the tournament fields in the distance, from torches and bonfires. Makri asks me if I've had any more thoughts on the case I'm working on.</p>
   <p>«Some. I think I know what's been going on. I'll need to visit the King's Record House again.»</p>
   <p>«I'll come with you tomorrow,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«If you win the tournament you'll still be celebrating.»</p>
   <p>«I won't be.»</p>
   <p>«You should celebrate.»</p>
   <p>We walk on, past the tree where Makri frightened my assailant. «I know you freed the dragon,» I say.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«I know you freed the dragon.»</p>
   <p>«No I didn't! And how could you possibly know anyway?»</p>
   <p>«When you bring me beer and encourage me to sleep, I'd say it's a good sign you want me out the way for a while. And when you're wondering if your swords can cut through sorcery…» I halt, and turn to my companion. «So, what happened?»</p>
   <p>«It took a while. But I managed to cut the ropes and branches. I made a big enough gap for the dragon to get through.»</p>
   <p>«What happened then?»</p>
   <p>«He licked my face, and flew off.»</p>
   <p>I nod.</p>
   <p>«Don't tell Lisutaris,» says Makri. «She might not like it.»</p>
   <p>«That you've gone directly against the King's orders, and freed the creature that was his pride and joy? Yes, I'd say she might not like it.»</p>
   <p>«Do you think it would affect her status?»</p>
   <p>«I think it would get her thrown out of the country. And you executed, if the King finds out you're responsible. If we're lucky, he'll think that Lasat's sorcery wasn't strong enough to hold it.»</p>
   <p>I regard Makri's actions as extremely foolish, and almost bound to have dire consequences, but I can't raise that much emotion about it. So much has happened over the past few weeks that one small dragon flying around freely doesn't seem to matter that much. With war approaching, it won't be that long till I'm standing in the middle of a phalanx with a spear in my hand, holding my shield over my head, as a much larger and deadlier dragon swoops down to attack. Probably with an Orcish Sorcerer on its back, firing spells.</p>
   <p>«The Orcs will march soon,» I say. «If we don't get our War Leader sorted out we'll be in trouble.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe it will be decided at the meeting,» suggests Makri.</p>
   <p>It takes us a while to force our way through the crowds at the edge of the tournament, on our way to the King's Meeting House. There are soldiers guarding the approach but they let us through with only a brief search. A few of the soldiers even congratulate Makri on her performances in the tournament, and wish her well. Maybe she'll have a few supporters. Elupus is a Simnian, after all, and Samsarina has never got along all that well with Simnia.</p>
   <p>«You're late,» hisses Lisutaris as we enter the building through the marble gateway.</p>
   <p>«My fault,» I say. «I was drinking beer and sleeping. What's happening?»</p>
   <p>«Baron Mabados is complaining to the King that the integrity of his tournament has been compromised by sorcery.»</p>
   <p>«There's no arguing with that. Have you told him it was Lasat who started it?»</p>
   <p>«The Samsarinan Sorcerers are blaming me.»</p>
   <p>At that moment the raised voices of the Barons are quietened as Daringos, the King's Steward, rises to speak. «This is all very unsatisfactory. The sword-fighting tournament is known far and wide. Samsarina's reputation will be damaged if people believe it's no longer honest. The King is deeply shocked that sorcery has been allowed to intrude.» Behind him, on his throne, the King nods, letting us know he is indeed shocked.</p>
   <p>«What happened to the Tournament Sorcerer?» asks the Simnian Ambassador. «Isn't he responsible for preventing this sort of thing?»</p>
   <p>«I've done my best,» says Markinos Moonstone. «But remarkably powerful sorcery has been employed.» He glares at Lisutaris, as if it's all her fault.</p>
   <p>«What do you have to say to this, Mistress of the Sky?» demands Daringos.</p>
   <p>Rather than denying everything, Lisutaris decides to go on the offensive. «I had no choice. The Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild have been trying to interfere with my fighter. I was obliged to defend her.»</p>
   <p>«Nonsense!» cries Charius. «We are completely innocent. It's my belief that Lisutaris's malign spells have been entirely responsible for carrying her protégé this far.»</p>
   <p>«Makri wouldn't have needed my help if you hadn't attacked her.»</p>
   <p>«So you admit you've been helping her?» says Charius.</p>
   <p>«There should be no sorcery used at all,» says Baron Mabados. «I insist it stops.»</p>
   <p>«I shall certainly not become involved,» says Lasat, grandly.</p>
   <p>«Oh, nonsense,» I say, addressing the King's Steward. «As Lisutaris's Chief Adviser, I can confirm that Lasat started this whole business. And he's going to keep on doing it. He'll be firing spells all the way through the final, no matter what he says.»</p>
   <p>«This is outrageous!» says Lasat. «How dare these Turanian refugees cast aspersions on me. I demand satisfaction!»</p>
   <p>«I demand you stop using sorcery.»</p>
   <p>«There must me no more interference!» insists Daringos. «The contest must be fair.»</p>
   <p>To the discomfiture of the Samsarinans, the Simnians and Niojans take the opportunity to voice some criticisms of Samsarinan incompetence, which annoys everyone, and threatens to derail the meeting. Charius the Wise — who, I should mention, I have never heard utter anything particularly wise — bangs his staff on the ground to get people's attention.</p>
   <p>«I have a suggestion,» he says.</p>
   <p>«Speak, Charius,» says the Chief Steward. «Your council is always worth hearing.»</p>
   <p>«Perhaps the best course of action would be simply to allow Lasat and Lisutaris to do as they please.»</p>
   <p>«I don't follow you.»</p>
   <p>«Give them permission to support their fighters in any way they can. Use whatever sorcery they want. Lisutaris can support Makri and Lasat can support Elupus. Let the best sorcerer and fighter win. After all, we've been wondering how to choose a War Leader. Why not let them fight it out?»</p>
   <p>Baron Mabados starts to object, but the young King chooses this moment to speak. «I like this! That's what we should do. Lasat and Lisutaris can use their sorcery to support their fighters, and whoever wins I'll support as War Leader.»</p>
   <p>The King is smiling, obviously taken with the idea. That's enough to convince his Barons. Even the Ambassadors don't seem to object. But from the way Lasat and Charius are looking pleased with themselves, I can tell we're being outmanoeuvred.</p>
   <p>«One moment,» I say. «Lisutaris will have no problem facing Lasat, but what about the rest of the Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild? It's hardly fair if they all join in against her.»</p>
   <p>«I'm sure that won't happen,» says the King. «Lasat, will that happen?»</p>
   <p>«Certainly not, Sire. You have my word that none but I shall use my power.»</p>
   <p>«Are we meant to believe that?» I look round for support. None is forthcoming. Apparently the King and his Barons actually believe the Samsarinan Sorcerers will play fair. Or they're pretending to believe it, more likely.</p>
   <p>«How do you feel about this, Mistress of the Sky?» asks the King.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris knows as well as I do that there's no chance of a fair contest, but she's in a difficult position. The King trusts his sorcerers, so it will look bad for her to accuse them of being a bunch of cheats. It will look worse if she refuses the challenge. «That is acceptable to me,» she says.</p>
   <p>«Splendid,» says King Gardos. «It should be an entertaining contest.»</p>
   <p>The meeting breaks up into a great gaggle of excited talk.</p>
   <p>«So it's us against the whole Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild,» says Lisutaris, as we head for the exit.</p>
   <p>«This isn't fair,» I say. «We shouldn't have accepted.»</p>
   <p>«We didn't seem to have a choice. Charius backed us into a corner. Maybe he's not as stupid as I've always thought.»</p>
   <p>«Makri,» I say. «Try and win the fight before too many spells hit me. They're really painful.»</p>
   <p>«The Samsarinans will target all of us,» says Lisutaris. «It's going to be difficult.»</p>
   <p>We leave the King's Meeting House, following a stream of Barons, Sorcerers, Ambassadors, Generals, servants and officials, all heading for the tournament fields. The cloudy sky above is dark red, reflecting the glowing bonfires. The air is thick with the aroma of roasting oxen, and noisy with minstrel music and drinking songs. When we reach the edge of the tournament field Lisutaris once again supplies me with the deflecting spell.</p>
   <p>«Try actually deflecting some this time,» she suggests. «Instead of just letting them bounce off you.» She checks my spell-protection charm, and Makri's too. At this moment Lasat will be doing the same for Elupus.</p>
   <p>«I wish I could just fight him fairly,» says Makri. «I'd beat him.»</p>
   <p>She would. Makri's recent performances in the arena have been superb. I'd tell her that if she wasn't already big-headed enough about her fighting technique.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas, can I have a word?»</p>
   <p>I look round. It's Baroness Demelzos, accompanied by a servant, who hangs back, out of earshot.</p>
   <p>«Baroness. I don't have much time.»</p>
   <p>«I know. But the wedding is meant to be tomorrow and Merlione is still refusing to leave the house.»</p>
   <p>«I think that's quite sensible.»</p>
   <p>«You can't imagine the trouble it's causing. My husband says he's lost patience. And my son just can't understand why she won't come to the wedding. Are you any nearer to finding out what's been going on?»</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«You are?» The Baroness looks surprised.</p>
   <p>«I have a good idea of what's behind it all. I don't have any proof yet. If I can, I'll visit you tomorrow, in the morning. Maybe I'll have something for you then.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos looks momentarily hopeful. «Well at least that's something.» She frowns. «Thraxas, from the way your female companions are staring at me, I'm guessing they know about our past.»</p>
   <p>«I mentioned it to them.»</p>
   <p>«That was hardly gallant.»</p>
   <p>«I've never been accused of gallantry.»</p>
   <p>«How did they react?»</p>
   <p>«They laughed.»</p>
   <p>The Baroness looks offended. «They laughed? That's quite insulting.»</p>
   <p>«They weren't laughing at you, they were laughing at me. They don't think I'm the sort of man who has affairs with women who go on to be Baronesses.»</p>
   <p>Demelzos looks over at Lisutaris and Makri, who are indeed staring at us, without bothering to disguise their interest. «Thraxas was quite a catch,» says the Baroness. «Quite the dashing young swordsman. Plenty of women in Elath were chasing him.» She leans over and places her hand on my arm. «He still has that robust charm, don't you think?»</p>
   <p>With that, the Baroness walks swiftly away, disappearing with her servant into the crowd. Lisutaris and Makri look at me with amazement. I don't remember ever seeing Makri's mouth hanging open before. It takes them a few moments before they can speak.</p>
   <p>«Robust charm?» says Lisutaris. «Dashing young swordsman?»</p>
   <p>«When these women were chasing you,» asks Makri. «Was it for unpaid debts?»</p>
   <p>I smile at them, as condescendingly as I can. «Laugh all you like. We now have it on good authority that Thraxas, champion sword-fighter, was quite a catch. Shall we proceed to the arena?»</p>
   <p>«How am I meant to concentrate after this?» mutters Makri. «It's affected my whole world-view.»</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Eight</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I still haven't picked up our winnings on Makri's last fight. While Makri goes off to put on her armour, I hurry down to Big Bixo's betting tent. I have to barge my way through the crowd. It seems like the whole of Elath is now scrambling to gamble on the final. Combius the armourer is among the throng.</p>
   <p>«Come to bet on Makri?» I ask.</p>
   <p>Combius looks uncomfortable. «I'm not sure.»</p>
   <p>«She can beat Elupus.»</p>
   <p>«Maybe. But now there's sorcery involved.»</p>
   <p>«Lisutaris is more powerful than Lasat,» I tell him.</p>
   <p>«I'm not sure about that. Anyway» — Combius lowers his voice. — «people are saying the whole Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild is going to support Elupus. Lisutaris isn't more powerful than twenty Samsarinan sorcerers.»</p>
   <p>«Yes she is. Bet on Makri, she'll win.»</p>
   <p>Combius goes away, still looking doubtful. I force my way into the tent. I'd expected both Makri and Elupus to be around the same odds, but the strong rumour that Elupus will be assisted by the whole Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild has sent a lot of money in his direction. He's listed at two to five, while Makri is seven to four.</p>
   <p>Our 10,000 winnings on the semi-final has taken our funds up to 22,042. I'd be tempted to wager it all, but once more, Bixo will only accept a bet of 5000 gurans. I place the bet, then hurry over to Generous Ges, where I do the same. As I leave, I'm silently cursing all bookmakers for their parsimony. If you're losing they'll take every guran off you. Once you start winning, they put a limit on your bets. Still, 10,000 gurans at seven to four isn't bad.</p>
   <p>The final is due to start any minute. I rush back to the tournament field. Once there, my spirit sags as I observe the number of Samsarinan sorcerers ranged against us. They seem to be everywhere. I try not to let my anxiety show.</p>
   <p>«Just concentrate on giving Elupus a good beating,» I tell Makri. «We'll take care of the rest.»</p>
   <p>Elupus isn't a particularly tall man, but he has a strong frame and a very powerful sword-arm. He's a colourful character, as evinced by the bright silver design on his shield, and the purple ribbon he wears on his helmet, a favour for some lady or other. He's let his hair grow so it hangs down his back in a thick pony tail. That's normal for a lower-class Turanian like me, but unusual for a Simnian. Like most veterans of the arena, he carries some facial scars. When he arrives in the centre of the arena he has the audacity to bow politely to Makri, as if it were a social occasion. Makri doesn't return his bow.</p>
   <p>My senses are again humming from the pent-up sorcery all around. I'll be lucky to make it back to he perimeter before someone fires a spell. The Marshal raises his flag and I retreat hastily towards Lisutaris. The Head of the Sorcerers Guild is ready for action. Her hair is thrust back untidily behind her ears, tied with a scrap of rainbow cloth. Her hands are already glowing with a faint purple light. Now, with no need to conceal her actions, her whole body begins to radiate magic, The entire surface of her eyes, whites and pupils, turn the same shade of purple. It's an eerie sight, something that only occurs among the most powerful Sorcerers.</p>
   <p>The Marshal drops his flag, and then quite a lot of things happen at once. Makri raises her sword, light flashes from Lisutaris's hands, and I'm hit on the chest by something that feels like a blacksmith's hammer. I crash to the ground but rise quickly, shaking my fist at the Samsarinan Sorcerers. Perhaps because of my anger, the deflection spell I'm carrying suddenly seems a lot stronger, and I get a vivid sense of an energy bolt flying towards Makri. I raise my hand and manage to alter its course so it plunges harmlessly into the ground.</p>
   <p>«Take that!» I cry. Immediately I'm hit by another crushing bolt of magic and once more crash to the ground. I struggle to my feet, roaring with rage. Lisutaris is deflecting spells from all directions, keeping them away from Makri while simultaneously trying to hinder Elupus. He and Makri are fighting fiercely in the centre of the arena. Their combat is furious, though unusual. Every few seconds one of them is jerked violently like a puppet, and has to struggle to remain upright while blocking desperately with their shield to keep their opponent at bay. Makri seems certain to score against Elupus as his shield flies out of position, but as she moves in to strike, she herself is jolted off her feet. Before she can regain her balance, Elupus recovers to deal her a crashing blow on her shield arm.</p>
   <p>«Half point to Elupus!» yells the Marshal. The crowd scream their approval.</p>
   <p>«Cheats!» I cry. «Lasat is cheating! His whole Guild's helping him!» My voice is drowned out in the mayhem. I deflect another spell, but there are so many Samsarinan Sorcerers working against us that it feels hopeless. From the way Lasat and Charius are hopping around in frustration, I'd guess that Lisutaris has their sorcery nullified, but that still leaves plenty of others. I do my best but I'm no match for them. Makri is again forced backwards under furious assault from Elupus and he scores another half point with a thrust which slides in under her shield, striking her on the hip. It's another painful blow, harder than would have been allowed in earlier rounds. I'm worried about the damage Makri is taking. Even without the buffeting from the sorcerers, she's suffering a severe barrage from Elupus, whose own actions are being enhanced by the Samsarinan Guild. I deflect another bolt but only succeed in bringing it down on myself. I crash to the ground for the third time. This time I struggle to rise, and I can taste blood in my mouth.</p>
   <p>«Damn you,» shouts Lisutaris, hauling me to my feet. «Concentrate!»</p>
   <p>«I'm doing my best!»</p>
   <p>I'm starting to think that the best plan might be to draw my sword and charge across the field, slaying as many Samsarinan Sorcerers as I can. Fortunately, before I can act, Lisutaris releases a spell so powerful that every Samsarinan sorcerer is frozen on the spot. For a few moments Makri and Elupus are unaffected by magic, and Makri seizes the opportunity to launch an attack, blocking Elupus's blade and then sliding her own sword down to slice into the armour on his shin.</p>
   <p>«Half point to Makri!» cries the Marshal.</p>
   <p>By the time the fight restarts, the Samsarinan Sorcerers have thrown off the effects of Lisutaris's spell. They've given up any pretence of not being involved, and are openly waving their arms, firing bolts, and intoning spells. It must be obvious to everyone what's going on. Not that I expect anyone to do anything about it. As I thud to the ground for the fourth time I regret that I never paid proper attention to my sorcerous studies. If I had, I might be able to help more. As it is, all I can do is try to lessen the load on Lisutaris, mainly by allowing myself to be a target. My body shakes as I attempt to deflect an energy spell from Makri which would probably have killed me were it not for my spell-protection necklace.</p>
   <p>Makri is being hit by spells regularly and only her incredible fighting technique is keeping her in the match. Several times, after she's been knocked off balance, it seems as if Elupus must strike, but she somehow manages to get her sword or shield in the way. Eventually, inevitably, he does make another break-through, and Makri falls behind by three half-points to one. The crowd is chanting and roaring. I have blood coming out of my nose. Lisutaris gasps as she's hit by a spell. The situation is fast becoming hopeless. Elupus advances and knocks Makri backwards with his shield. She goes over again, tripped by sorcery, and sprawls on the ground. Then, with a move which astonishes both the crowd and Elupus, she manages to score a half point by thrusting her sword up into Elupus's ribs, even as he stands over her to deliver a lethal stroke.</p>
   <p>I scream in appreciation. «You can do it Makri!» Something hits me on the head and everything goes blank for a few seconds. I come back to my senses to hear Lisutaris cursing as the Marshal awards Elupus another half point. The score is now four to two, and Elupus needs just one more strike. I try to summon up energy but I have nothing left. I can barely move. Lisutaris is breathing heavily as she attempts to repel the relentless onslaught of the entire Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild. Elupus attacks again and the sound of his sword, crashing against Makri's shield, can be heard even above the roar of the crowd. Elupus presses his attack, propelled forward by the weight of sorcery behind him. Makri is forced back, and as she turns to avoid a thrust I can see blood seeping out from under her helmet. The sight enrages me.</p>
   <p>«That's it,» I cry, drawing my sword. «I'm going to kill someone.» I step onto the field. A steward tries to haul me back. I push him away and march forward but I'm brought to a sudden halt when, very unexpectedly, a small white dragon plummets out of the sky and lands on Elupus. The Simnian swordsman takes a heavy blow and is knocked to the ground. The crowd screams. The Marshal gapes stupidly and seems unable to move. To her great credit, Makri still has her wits about her. She leaps over to the prone figure of Elupus and slashes with her sword, halting the blade as it touches his throat.</p>
   <p>«Lethal Stroke!» I scream, and charge forward. By the time I reach the centre of the field, the young dragon has shuffled over to Makri and is licking her face. The Marshal hasn't yet made a call.</p>
   <p>«What's the delay?» I demand. «Call Makri as the winner. That was a lethal stroke!»</p>
   <p>The Marshal, his flag hanging limply in mid-air, seems to be having trouble comprehending what just happened. «I… eh… it was…»</p>
   <p>«Makri made a lethal stroke to the throat. Call it or I'll kill you!»</p>
   <p>«Lethal stroke,» mutters the Marshal.</p>
   <p>Lasat Axe of Gold is swiftly into the field. «This is a complete travesty!» he rages. «That dragon attacked my fighter. It's foul play! What's it doing here anyway?»</p>
   <p>«Your spells obviously weren't good enough to hold it,» I reply. «Anyway, Makri's the winner.»</p>
   <p>«She is not the winner! There was outside interference!»</p>
   <p>«This whole fight has been about outside interference!»</p>
   <p>There's movement around the edge of the field as some of the Samsarinan sorcerers approach, but the stewards and officials hang back, not liking the look of the dragon, which is now considerably bigger than a man. Soldiers have rushed to protect the King, and stand in a semi-circle with arrows notched in their bows. Lisutaris arrives, moving slowly and painfully.</p>
   <p>«What's happening?» she gasps. «Has Makri won?»</p>
   <p>«Yes,» I say.</p>
   <p>«No she hasn't!» cries Lasat. «I will not stand for this outrage.» He swings round to face Makri, raising his hand. The dragon interprets this as a threat to its friend, and roars threateningly. Lasat furiously casts a spell at it. The young dragon howls in pain, then cringes like a young child.</p>
   <p>«Don't do that!» says Makri. «You shouldn't» —</p>
   <p>Makri doesn't manage to complete the sentence because at that moment a gigantic white dragon lands beside us with an earth-shaking crash. The huge beast is roaring with anger, and breathing flame. I grab Makri's arm with one hand and Lisutaris's sleeve with the other.</p>
   <p>«Run,» I say, and we run. We flee towards the edge of the field where the assembled crowd are cowering in fear. The sudden, shocking arrival of such a monstrous dragon spreads panic. Such a beast has never been seen in Elath before.</p>
   <p>«I knew its mother would come back,» I gasp, as the three of us stumble to safety. When I look round to see if we're being pursued, I'm confronted by an awful sight. The Ice Dragon, infuriated by Lasat's attack on her child, has grabbed him in its jaws and is shaking him around like a toy. Several Sorcerers approach as close as they dare but their spells don't have any effect. The dragon finally spits out Lasat. As his mangled body lands on the grass, it's obvious that the Samsarinan Sorcerers Guild will now be needing a new leader.</p>
   <p>There's a call to arms from close to the King. General Hemistos has rallied some troops. Among the soldiers I notice Baron Girimos, gamely advancing despite his age and bulk. The ice dragon ignores them. It looks down at its child, then, quite tenderly, takes the young dragon by the scruff of the neck like a cat picking up a kitten. It spreads its huge wings and rises majestically into the air. A few arrows fly wide of the mark as the dragon circles, gaining height, then heads off to the North. The shouting stops, and a hush descends on the tournament field.</p>
   <p>«That was quite an experience,» gasps Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«It was,» I reply. «Makri, are you seriously injured?»</p>
   <p>Makri removes her helmet. Blood drips from her mouth and her nose, and she has two black eyes.</p>
   <p>«I'm all right,» she says. «Did I win?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. The Marshal called lethal stroke before he fled the field.»</p>
   <p>A young messenger in royal livery appears at a run. «Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky,» he says. «The King would like to see you immediately.»</p>
   <p>«I must attend to my bodyguard first,» replies Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«The King said <emphasis>immediately</emphasis>.»</p>
   <p>«Tell the King I'll be along immediately after I've attended to Makri.»</p>
   <p>The messenger shrugs, and departs briskly. Lisutaris produces a lace handkerchief from inside her cloak and dabs some of the blood from Makri's face.</p>
   <p>«I'm all right,» says Makri. «Don't worry about it.»</p>
   <p>«I'll just transfer some minor healing into you. I don't have much power left.» Lisutaris places her hand on Makri's forehead. Nothing happens. The Sorceress frowns. «I don't have <emphasis>any</emphasis> power left. Do you want to go home? I can send you in my carriage.»</p>
   <p>Makri refuses. She wants to accompany Lisutaris. I pick up Makri's personal belongings and the three of us trudge wearily across the field. A distraught collection of Samsarinan Sorcerers are standing round the body of their dead leader.</p>
   <p>«I could do with some healing too, when you get your power back,» I tell Lisutaris. «I took a lot of painful blows during that contest.»</p>
   <p>«Thraxas, I'm sure you've got enough pies inside you to make a swift recovery.»</p>
   <p>«Is that all the thanks I get for putting my life on the line to protect you and Makri?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris comes to a halt. «One moment,» she says. «How did the young dragon get free?»</p>
   <p>Makri immediately looks guilty.</p>
   <p>«Perhaps Lasat's spells weren't any good,» I suggest.</p>
   <p>«Lasat's spells were fine,» says Lisutaris. «I checked them.»</p>
   <p>«Well, in that case it's a mystery.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris reaches over to place her hand on the scabbard of Makri's black Orcish sword. «This weapon has been used against sorcery. Recently.»</p>
   <p>«I freed the dragon,» admits Makri. «Sorry.»</p>
   <p>«It did work out well in the end,» I say.</p>
   <p>Lisutaris shakes her head. «Let's hope the King doesn't find out.»</p>
   <p>We have to pass through thick lines of soldiers, still guarding their monarch in case the dragon returns. The King is surrounded by his officials and a collection of Barons. Unusually, he seems ready to speak for himself. «That did not go as expected, Mistress of the Sky. Some of my advisers wonder if the interference from the dragons should nullify the contest.» The King pauses, then raises his voice. «I have over-ruled them. The appearance of such a beast should focus our minds on the dangers we'll be facing soon. The West needs an experienced War Leader and I will now support Lisutaris for that position.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris thanks the King, in the gracious, courtly manner she's capable of, even when severely fatigued.</p>
   <p>«Do you know how the young dragon came to escape from its sorcerous cage?»</p>
   <p>Makri blushes, though with her black eyes and blood-stained mouth it's not that easy to spot. Lisutaris doesn't know how to answer. It's time for me to step up. «Lasat's spells were quite deficient,» I say. «I tried to tell him, but he wouldn't listen. It's unfortunate it ended up costing him his life, but the whole thing could have been much worse had Lisutaris not driven the dragons away so quickly.»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris looks startled. «I didn't» -</p>
   <p>«It was good work from the Mistress of the Sky,» I continue. «Saved many lives. She'll be a great War Leader. Incidentally, your Highness, if I may be permitted to ask a question — some graceless elements have been casting doubts on Makri's victory. I was wondering if there might be an official announcement about the winner?»</p>
   <p>The King nods his head. «Makri was clearly the winner. It will be officially declared.»</p>
   <p>The meeting comes to an end. We walk back across the field, heading for Lisutaris's carriage.</p>
   <p>«I didn't chase off the dragons,» says Lisutaris.</p>
   <p>«There's no harm in giving your reputation a boost.» I yawn. «When I get home I'm going to send a servant out for food then I'm going to sleep for a week.»</p>
   <p>«You said you'd visit Baroness Demelzos in the morning,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Oh dammit. And I meant to visit the Record House before that.»</p>
   <p>We clamber into the carriage. «I could really do with some of that healing energy,» I tell Lisutaris. But the Sorcerer is already rolling herself a thazis stick, which won't help her recover her powers any faster. I'll have to rely on sleep and a few beers to get by.</p>

    <p><strong>Chapter Twenty-Nine</strong></p>
   </title>
   <p>I wake early the next morning. My body aches. I feel old and battered. I'm debating whether or not to go back to sleep when Makri pokes her head into my room.</p>
   <p>«Are we going investigating?»</p>
   <p>«Why are you up so early?»</p>
   <p>Makri shrugs. «I'm feeling better.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not.» I haul myself out of bed, and glare at Makri. She ask me what I'm looking annoyed about.</p>
   <p>«You. When I won the tournament I celebrated for a week. It would have been longer if me and Demmy the barmaid hadn't been arrested for indecency in the fountain. But here you are, sober and healthy. You even went to bed early. It's not right.»</p>
   <p>«I didn't feel much like celebrating.»</p>
   <p>I scramble around collecting my boots and sword. I ask Makri if she'll grab some food from the kitchen or cellar while I get ready. I suppose it's as well that Makri is sober. I need her help today. But it goes against the grain that she didn't celebrate. Anyone else would have.</p>
   <p>«I have something for you before we go,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>She hands me a bright new Elvish sword. «This was part of my prize for winning the tournament. I have two good swords already, so you can have it.»</p>
   <p>I take the sword. It's a valuable item, and a much better weapon than my current blade. It's a very fine gift. I look at Makri. I have no idea how to thank her properly. I feel awkward, and lost for words. Perhaps her strategy of bursting into tears and running out the room isn't such a bad idea.</p>
   <p>«Let's go,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>Outside I commandeer Lisutaris's carriage. «We need to hurry. Demelzos's son is due to get married later today. I'd like to solve this before that happens.»</p>
   <p>«Is there any chance of that?» asks Makri. «I didn't know you were close.»</p>
   <p>«I've got a good idea what's going on. Demelzos's daughter Merlione is interfering with her son's inheritance in some way. I don't know how, but she is.»</p>
   <p>Makri looks puzzled. «How do you know that?»</p>
   <p>«Nothing else fits. Merlione's brother's getting married into Baron Vosanos's family, and he's taking a chunk of money with him. Vosanos needs that money badly. Somehow Merlione's spoiling things. That's what her friend Alceten discovered. That's why she was killed, and that's why someone's been trying to kill Merlione.»</p>
   <p>«I suppose it would make sense,» says Makri. «But aren't you just guessing?»</p>
   <p>«No. I'm sure. More so since I learned that Zinlantol at the Royal Record House is a cousin of Magranos, Baron Vosanos's Chief Steward.»</p>
   <p>We share some bread on the way. Makri hands me a bottle she brought from the kitchen. I take a drink.</p>
   <p>«Water?»</p>
   <p>«What did you expect for breakfast?»</p>
   <p>I shake my head in disgust. When we arrive at the Record House I leave the carriage outside and march past the guards without looking at them. Inside the Record House, Zinlantol is sitting behind her desk, as always. When I approach, she regards me with loathing. A lot of people have done that recently.</p>
   <p>«Did you pass information about Alceten's work to your cousin Magranos?»</p>
   <p>«I have nothing to say to you!» says Zinlantol. She stands up quickly and disappears through the door behind her, into some private staff area.</p>
   <p>«I'd say she was,» I mutter to Makri, as we make our way upstairs. «She was already getting rid of evidence about the Baron's debts, destroying the papers. When she learned that Alceten had discovered something that was going to cost Baron Vosanos a lot of money, she passed that on to her cousin too.»</p>
   <p>Upstairs, the corner where Alceten was working is still surrounded by books and scrolls, many of which I haven't even opened yet. I pick up the large book of Samsarinan Commercial Law and hand it to Makri.</p>
   <p>«This is the book that was out of place. Alceten might have been reading it before she was killed. Go through it and see if there's anything relevant. I'll make a start on the scrolls.»</p>
   <p>«How long do we have?»</p>
   <p>«About three hours.»</p>
   <p>«I can't get through this in three hours.»</p>
   <p>«Do your best.»</p>
   <p>We sit down and read. As soon as I pick up a scroll I start to remember how much I ache. These Samsarinan Sorcerers really gave me a battering. I glance through the scroll, find nothing relevant, throw it to one side and pick up another. <emphasis>The Law of Tort regarding Interference to Property Rights with Regard to Trespass by Hostile Orcs</emphasis>. I shake my head. Already my eyes are starting to swim. Can't these legal clerks make their writing a little bigger? I put the scroll to one side, being fairly sure that no Orcs have been interfering with local property. I notice Makri has gone off to the far end of the room, where she's hunting through cabinets. I pick up another scroll. It deals with property disputes between Barons and their subjects in times of famine. Again, it's so densely written I can barely read it. I struggle on for as long as I can, then shake my head in despair. I'm beaten. If there's some legal secret here, we're not going to find it.</p>
   <p>«Found it,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«What?»</p>
   <p>«Alceten made a note in the third appendix of the law book. It referred to another book from three centuries ago. I've just read the relevant part.»</p>
   <p>«And?»</p>
   <p>«It referred me to another legal tract. I found that too.»</p>
   <p>«Are you ever going to come to the point?»</p>
   <p>«Listen.» Makri reads from a very old scroll. «In memory of Queen Eferinis, who first discovered queenstone, and arrayed her daughters splendidly in jewels, all queenstone will pass from mother to daughter, and be inherited in the female line.»</p>
   <p>I take the scroll from Makri. «This was drafted by King Moslos. He reigned about six hundred years ago. Could it still be current?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so, if it was never repealed. Everyone must have forgotten about it till Alceten came across it.»</p>
   <p>«Alceten discovered that Merlione should inherit her mother's Queenstone mines.» I produce a magic purse from my tunic pocket.</p>
   <p>«Where did you get that?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«I borrowed it from Lisutaris while she was still sleeping. Let's go. We have to stop a wedding.»</p>
   <p>We smuggle the relevant documents out of the Record House using the magic pocket, then ride swiftly towards Baroness Demelzos's mansion. Outside the mansion are numerous carriages, ready to carry the family to the wedding.</p>
   <p>«Have you ever destroyed a wedding before?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Once or twice. It never goes down well.»</p>
   <p>A servant at the gate tries to get in our way. I brush him aside. «Thraxas of Turai, Chief Adviser to Lisutaris, Mistress of the Sky. Here as guest of Baroness Demelzos.»</p>
   <p>Inside, the house is in the sort of uproar you'd expect when the eldest son of an important family is about to get married. Though neither I nor Makri look like wedding guests, everyone is too busy with their own problems to pay us much attention. I lead Makri upstairs to the Baroness's reception rooms. I burst in to find the Baroness having her hair done by two servants.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas! How dare you burst in when» -</p>
   <p>«Sorry Baroness. I have important news.» I look pointedly at the servants. The Baroness dismisses them with a nod of her head.</p>
   <p>«Well?»</p>
   <p>«Someone from Baron Vosanos's household has been trying to kill Merlione. Whether it's the Baron himself, or his steward, I don't know. But they're responsible.» I take the scroll from the magic purse. «By ancient law, Merlione inherits your queenstone mines, not your son. Baron Vosanos is bankrupt. He's depending on your son bringing wealth into his family. But your son will only be wealthy if Merlione is dead.» I hand the scroll to the Baroness.</p>
   <p>«But this is so old,» she says.</p>
   <p>«I think it's still legal. Alceten was killed because she discovered it. The Baron knew all about her work because his Chief Steward has a cousin in the Record House. She was keeping him up to date with Alceten's research.»</p>
   <p>«I really can't believe Baron Vosanos would try to kill my daughter.»</p>
   <p>«I don't know if he's directly responsible. More likely he just asked his Steward Magranos to deal with the problem. Magranos is capable of arranging a murder. He tried to arrange mine. If your son marries into that family, I don't think your daughter will ever be safe.»</p>
   <p>Baroness Demelzos calls for her servants and asks them if her husband has left the house yet. Part of his role in the wedding is to escort his son to the church. They tell her he's almost on the point of setting off.</p>
   <p>«Wait here,» the Baroness says, then hurries off. Makri and I are left alone in the reception room. I pour myself a glass of wine.</p>
   <p>«What now?» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«Either the Baron believes me and cancels the wedding, or he decides I'm a liar and throws me out. Either way, I've done all I can.»</p>
   <p>Makri reaches for the decanter, and winces with pain. She can still feel the effects of the fight, even if she's pretending she can't. We sip wine from silver goblets, waiting for the Baroness to return. After almost an hour, we're still waiting.</p>
   <p>«Is she coming back?»</p>
   <p>«Doesn't look like it.» I rise from my chair. «Let's go home.»</p>
   <p>I ask a servant outside to tell Baroness Demelzos that we've departed. The house is still bustling with activity, but I can sense apprehension among the scurrying servants and tradesmen. They know something's wrong. Makri takes the reigns as we drive home. We pass a squadron of heavily armed troops who've just arrive in Elath. From Hadassa in the South, I think, judging by their armour. Many more troops should be arriving soon.</p>
   <p>«Enormous human!»</p>
   <p>«Did someone just shout <emphasis>enormous human</emphasis>?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«I think so.»</p>
   <p>«They must be referring to you.» Makri halts the carriage and we look around. Running towards us with a great grin on her face is a slender young Elf with spiky yellow hair and a broad grin. I recognise her. It's Sendroo, from the Elvish Isle of Avula.</p>
   <p>«Hello Thraxas! Hello Makri!»</p>
   <p>«Droo? What are you doing here?»</p>
   <p>«I sailed up with the advance party. I'm a messenger in the Elvish Reconnoissance Regiment!»</p>
   <p>«You are?» Last time I saw Droo, who's around eighteen I think, she was a poet, and quite an intoxicated one at that. I wasn't expecting her to pop up in Samsarina, dressed in the dull-green tunic and leggings of an Elvish Scout. You meet all sorts of unexpected people in wartime.</p>
   <p>«Yes! Isn't it fun? What are you doing here?»</p>
   <p>«We're refugees from Turai,» I tell her.</p>
   <p>«But we're going back,» says Makri.</p>
   <p>«It's so good to see you again! I can't really talk now, my platoon is marching up to see the King. Tell me where you live and I'll come and visit!»</p>
   <p>Makri smiles at Droo. «It will be good to see you.»</p>
   <p>We give Droo our address. She runs off up the street after her platoon, still grinning. She's carrying a bow on her back, and a sheaf full of arrows. I shake my head. I'm not sure that having Droo in the Elvish advance party fills me with confidence. At least it means the Elvish troops are on their way.</p>
   <p>When we arrive back at Arichdamis's house, Lisutaris is stepping out of an unfamiliar carriage. As soon as she sees us she scowls and yells at us. «What's the idea of stealing my carriage?»</p>
   <p>«We needed it,» I say. «I had to see Baroness Demelzos in a hurry.»</p>
   <p>«Does this have anything to do with the wedding being cancelled?»</p>
   <p>«It was cancelled?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. I and about four hundred of the Samsarinan aristocracy were left waiting in church like a bunch of idiots, till Baron Mabados finally arrived and announced the wedding couldn't go ahead due to family illness. A very sudden attack, apparently. I presume that's not the real reason?»</p>
   <p>«No. I'll tell you about it inside.»</p>
   <p>A little later, while relating the string of brilliant deductions and unrelenting hard work that led to me solving the case, I can't help noticing that Lisutaris seems distracted. I ask her what's the matter.</p>
   <p>«Kublinos. He's arriving soon to take me to dinner. I don't want to go.»</p>
   <p>«You're not relying on him for money any more,» I point out. I take out Lisutaris's magic purse, ignore her protests about me borrowing it without asking, and pour 31,500 gurans onto the table. It's a hefty pile of cash, even though some of it is made up of 1,000 guran gold bars.</p>
   <p>«We actually ended up with 34,582,» I tell them. «But I paid back the Baroness the three hundred she staked us. I offered her a bigger cut, but she wouldn't take it. I'm giving Arichdamis 282 gurans to make up for the damage to his cellars. And I gave 2,500 gurans to the local Saint Quatinius's hospital for the poor. When we were on that boat, I did promise I'd donate something if we made it back to shore.»</p>
   <p>I'm expecting some complaints about this, particularly from the heathen Makri, but none are forthcoming. Makri and Lisutaris seem content that I've made the donation. We have had a lot of luck recently; perhaps some saint has been looking after us.</p>
   <p>«So that gives us 10,500 gurans each. No need to thank me for my brilliant betting campaign. Though it does strike me you won't be collecting your winnings from Lasat, which is unfortunate.»</p>
   <p>«That's the only unfortunate thing about his death,» says Lisutaris. «Anyway, thanks for the brilliant betting campaign. It's good to have money and not be relying on Kublinos. But I can hardly just tell him to go away, can I? Not after he's been so generous.»</p>
   <p>«Of course you can,» says Makri. «Just tell him you're not interested.»</p>
   <p>«That's easy for you to say,» says Lisutaris. «I don't see you telling General Hemistos to go away, even though you want to.»</p>
   <p>«I'm not very good at these things. Is he coming here with Kublinos?»</p>
   <p>Lisutaris nods. Makri looks worried. «Thraxas, could you tell Kublinos and Hemistos we're not really interested?»</p>
   <p>«Absolutely no chance,» I say. «If you can't deal with unwanted attention that's your problem. And if Kublinos and Hemistos are headed here, I'm off to the Jolly Bandit for a civilised drop of ale.»</p>
   <p>I leave the house but haven't travelled very far when I hear the clatter of Lisutaris's fancy shoes on the cobblestones. Both she and Makri have apparently decided to flee the scene rather than face their prospective suitors.</p>
   <p>«This is really pathetic,» I tell them, as they catch up. «Two grown women who can't cope with a little personal problem.»</p>
   <p>«Shut up and get inside the tavern before they get here,» says Lisutaris, hurrying into the Jolly Bandit. Not a place which will do much for her status, I'd say, though perhaps it doesn't matter so much any more, now she's been chosen as War Leader. As soon as we're inside, a waitress hurries over, recognising me as a valuable customer. I order beer for myself, and wine for Lisutaris and Makri.</p>
   <p>«Incidentally, Lisutaris. Are you still wondering about Arichdamis's plans?»</p>
   <p>«The ones that were stolen? Of course.»</p>
   <p>«Well check in you magic purse. In the seventh compartment.»</p>
   <p>The Sorceress frowns, and fishes around inside her purse. Finally she emerged with the plans in her hand.</p>
   <p>«How did these get here?»</p>
   <p>«They've been there all the time,» I tell her. «No one stole them. You just put them in there when you'd been smoking thazis and forgot all about it.»</p>
   <p>Makri laughs. Lisutaris looks embarrassed.</p>
   <p>«You really should cut down on your intake,» I tell her. «You're War Leader now. You can hardly expect the combined armies of the West to march off to war behind a woman who doesn't know what she's got in her purse. It's hardly re-assuring.»</p>
   <p>«Be quiet,» says Lisutaris. «Sorceresses never know what they have in their purses. We're famous for it.»</p>
   <p>«What will happen with the Baroness and her daughter now?» asks Makri.</p>
   <p>«Nothing, I imagine. Baron Mabados will keep pretending his son is sick till eventually everyone forgets about the wedding. It's a tactful way of getting out of it. Vosanos and his family won't be pleased, but they won't say anything in public.»</p>
   <p>«So it will just be hushed up?»</p>
   <p>«Yes. Barons aren't going to start accusing each other of trying to murder family members. It would make them all look bad in front of the peasants. The King wouldn't like it.»</p>
   <p>Makri thinks about this for a few moments. «But what about Alceten?»</p>
   <p>«What about her?»</p>
   <p>«She was murdered. Is no one going to be put on trial for that?»</p>
   <p>«No. It will never even be acknowledged as a murder.»</p>
   <p>«Who was responsible?»</p>
   <p>«That's hard to say. Zinlantol was keeping Magranos informed about Alceten. So I suppose she started it all off.»</p>
   <p>«But who actually killed her?»</p>
   <p>I shrug. «Someone small enough to hide themselves in the front of the carriage that ran her over. I doubt I'd ever be able to find out who that was. They're probably not in Elath any more. Magranos will have hired some thug and then made sure he disappeared quickly.»</p>
   <p>«So this Magranos,» says Makri. «He's the person who gave the order to kill her?»</p>
   <p>«Most probably. But there's no way of getting evidence. Even if there was, the King would suppress it.»</p>
   <p>Makri isn't satisfied. She doesn't like it that a young woman was murdered and no one will be brought to justice.</p>
   <p>«Will Baron Vosanos be going to war?»</p>
   <p>«Yes.»</p>
   <p>«Will his steward Magranos be going with him?»</p>
   <p>«I suppose so.»</p>
   <p>«If I meet him, I'll make him pay,» says Makri, menacingly.</p>
   <p>«Thraxas!» cries a loud, booming voice. «I hoped I'd find you here.» Baron Girimos claps me on the shoulder. He's looking portly, healthy, and in the mood for beer. «Damnedest thing just happened. Was all dressed up for a wedding and then it was cancelled. Wife and her relatives are all complaining about it now, my house is nightmare. I had to escape. Waitress — beer, klee and the contents of your kitchen over here, if you please!»</p>
   <p>The Baron has already met Lisutaris, and greets her politely. When he recognises Makri, he congratulates her very warmly on her victory in the tournament. «Good technique,» he says. «Not surprised, with Thraxas teaching you. Good man, Thraxas. Fought with the Turanian Phalanxes at Blackwing Rise. Of course, he'd never have got out of there alive if my cavalry hadn't rescued him.»</p>
   <p>«Nonsense!» I exclaim. «My phalanx arrived just in time to prevent your cavalry from being massacred.»</p>
   <p>Girimos laughs heartily. «Your memory's shaky again. Look, we were here» — «The Baron starts arranging pepper pots and cutlery to represent troop placements.» — and you were there. The Orcish Fourth Infantry were over there and the Sixth were coming up the hill with a dragon behind them -</p>
   <p>«That wasn't the Sixth Orcish Infantry,» says Makri. «It was the Ninth.»</p>
   <p>«What?» We look at her in surprise. «How would you know anything about it?»</p>
   <p>«My Orcish Lord was leading them,» says Makri. «I heard him talk about it, often. Look» — «Makri starts re-arranging the cutlery.» — «I'll show you what happened. The Ninth Orcish infantry were here, at the river bank» -</p>
   <p>«They can't have been there,» says the Baron. «That's where the Turanian Sorcerers were trapped.»</p>
   <p>«I beg your pardon?» says Lisutaris. «Trapped? What's this about the Turanian Sorcerers being trapped?»</p>
   <p>«They were pinned down by heavy archery,» says the Baron. «I remember it well.»</p>
   <p>«Nonsense,» cries Lisutaris. «Age must be affecting your memory. I was there that day as a young Sorcerer on my first campaign. The way I remember it, the phalanxes were hopelessly pinned down by dragons on the south of the slope, and the cavalry were trapped on the north by the Agban Orcish Sorcerers Guild. If I hadn't led the Turanian Sorcerers through the middle neither of you would ever have made it out alive.»</p>
   <p>«<emphasis>Led</emphasis> the Sorcerers?» I say. «I thought you were a young Sorcerer on your first campaign?»</p>
   <p>«Our commander, Agbereth Red-Flame, was killed by a dragon so I took charge. I stepped up and told the other Sorcerers <emphasis>We're going up that hill or we'll die in the attempt!</emphasis>'»</p>
   <p>«Your Sorcerers were trapped on the river bank till my phalanx saved the day!»</p>
   <p>«Preposterous,» says Lisutaris. «Give me that pepper pot, I'll show you what happened.» She turns her head to call to the waitress. «Bring me another goblet of wine while I show these memory-impaired old campaigners how I saved their lives at Blackwing Rise. Better still, send over the bottle. It may take a while.»</p>
