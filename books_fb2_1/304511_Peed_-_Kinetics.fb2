    <p>Author’s Note</p>
   </title>
   <p>So <emphasis>Kinetics</emphasis> marks a large chunk of my free time. I began writing several years ago and worked with a small group of people to get just the right idea. I’ve thrown the manuscript more times than I care to admit and feel that the characters are part of me. I had my hang ups sure but it was a great journey along the way. Thanks to everyone who had ripped open their flesh and poured their blood in along with mine.</p>

    <p>Chapter 1: The Orphans</p>
   </title>
   <p>The food was always cold, but I filled my tray anyway. When I got to the front of the line I took my government issued free lunch card from my back pocket, and handed it over to the lunch lady. She swiped the card in her computer and marked today’s date, "You have six meals left in your program.” She handed the card back to me, and I tried to put it away without anyone seeing.</p>
   <p>“Why is it that you can’t pay for you food like everyone else?” a boy behind me pushed. This kind of thing happened a few times a week. I didn’t care about being poor, but everyone in this school seemed fixated on this fact. Ignore what he says and walk away I told myself, but that didn’t stop him from going on, “Yeah, that’s right don’t listen to me you stuck up…” before he could finish, his buddy walked up and they began chest bumping and high fives followed by an explanation on the <emphasis>sick burn </emphasis>that I was just given.</p>
   <p>Normally I could blend in to the crowd quite nicely at five foot five and only a hundred and twenty pounds. My guardian expected me to do at least thirty minutes of exercise per day to stay healthy, which put me somewhere between athletic and skinny. I was the definition of the word <emphasis>average</emphasis>. My fiery red hair was the only part of me that I was particularly proud of and it was constantly getting me accused of using unnatural hair color by teachers.</p>
   <p>I sat down at an empty table and began gnawing on the so called chicken sandwich that I was served. The room was bustling with at least a hundred or so students coming and going. We were allowed to do whatever we wanted to do during lunch as long as we were back to class when the hour was up.</p>
   <p>The boy from the lunch line, Josh, along with his normal gang of buddies sat down at the table next to mine, “So, how about we finish our conversation?” the boy smiled a toothy grin. All of his friends were quiet waiting for my response. I always wondered what kind of damage that he suffered to spend so much time picking on a girl.</p>
   <p>“What conversation? Oh…wait, you mean you once again being the biggest asshole to walk the face of this planet?” I knew as the words left my lips that I would one way or another live to regret them.</p>
   <p>“How dare you!” he wasn’t used to anyone, especially me, actually talking back to him. As he stood to do god knows what to me, most likely sock me I wouldn’t put it past him, his girlfriend walked up and took his attention away from me.</p>
   <p>“We’ll finish this later.” He mouthed over his girlfriend’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>As much as it made me sick to my stomach I made a kissing noise and said, “See you later Josh.”</p>
   <p>His girlfriend reached out and smacked him across the face. He was furious, but had to chase after her to try and explain that I was screwing with him. He returned a few minutes later, alone and furious, and started to eat.</p>
   <p>I went back to my food, even colder now, and almost completely inedible. My mood for the day was completely shot.</p>
   <p>I was a constant target for ridicule. I lived in an orphanage with a few other kids that went to this school. Hillside was a place where they sent kids like me who have difficulties assimilating, or as I called settling for, a family. I have lived there for five years, I’m seventeen, and right around the corner is my eighteenth birthday. All of us at the orphanage are about the same age, within a few months anyway. Like there is some kind of cut off age for someone to be able to find a family.</p>
   <p>Ronnie, one of the other orphans, came to the table from the serving line. He could have blend in as easy as me, but chose a different approach. His short black hair was spiked in all different directions. He always seemed to be in a good mood, and talked to tons of people as he passed by their tables. I never understood why he always sat down at my table when he so many other friends that he could sit with.</p>
   <p>He dug into his food. He was able to eat anything, as longs as it was dead before he started, and sometimes I even wondered about that. “What’s up?” he asked between bites.</p>
   <p>“Nothing.” I tried to mask my irritation, but it wasn’t long before he picked up on my tone, and he knew my tones.</p>
   <p>“Grace, what’s wrong?” he put his sandwich down.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about it.” before I could stop myself I had glanced over to the table of jerks, who were all laughing it up having a great lunch.</p>
   <p>“What happened, I swear if they laid a hand on you, I’ll kill ‘em.” He stood fork in hand. We weren’t usually given knives for lunch.</p>
   <p>“No, just verbal abuse, sit down.” I pulled on his arm, “What, are you going to fork them to death with a plastic utensil? Enjoy your lunch.” I grinned at the thought of him doing just that.</p>
   <p>He sat uneasy and picked up his sandwich; he took a bite and then a big, forceful, gulp of his drink. He didn’t say anything until he couldn’t keep quiet anymore, “Why can’t they just leave you alone? They never mess with me and I don’t think that Kenny, or Sandy ever get this kind of treatment.”</p>
   <p>Kenny and Sandy were two other orphans in Hillside; somehow they actually fit in with the “so called” social groups. I didn’t know how Kenny did it; he joked around a lot. Sandy was gorgeous, at least compared to most of the girls in the school. They usually had friends around if any of the bullies started in on them.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know Ronnie and to be honest I really don’t care. I don’t think that they are ever going to stop. So I’m not going to worry about it.” I threw my fork down and officially gave up on the crappy food, chugged what I could of my drink, and stood up taking my tray in my hands.</p>
   <p>“Well, those clowns need to be taught a lesson.” He took a rather forceful bite out of a helpless apple.</p>
   <p>“You think?” I lathered on the sarcasm, "But not by you.” I put my foot down.</p>
   <p>“And why not?”</p>
   <p>“Maybe because they’re bigger than you, or maybe because they have you out numbered six to one, and I highly doubt that they are going to fight far.” I rolled my eyes.</p>
   <p>He got up from the table picking up his tray, “Yeah well, we’ll see.” He stormed off towards the trash cans.</p>
   <p>I left the lunch room before the class bell rang so that I could be one of the first people back into the classroom. The teacher was boring, no ifs, ands, or buts’ about it. On top of that it was history class so sleep was on the top of most people’s to-do lists.</p>
   <p>I didn’t sleep; I didn’t pay much attention to the lecture either. I preferred to use my time more for me. We were given e-book readers at the beginning of the year for our text books. I hacked mine so that I could load my own novels, which I read instead of the textbook. A book about humans colonizing the deepest reaches of the galaxy, it was interesting enough, it kept me from being bored to tears anyway.</p>
   <p>The teacher droned on about the finer details about World War II, the same things that we have been taught several times over the past few years. Most of the students in the class could have taken the tests without even studying.</p>
   <p>Before I could finish the chapter that I was reading, the bell signaling the end of classes rang. I finished the line that I was on and stuffed all of my things into my bag. I slowly shuffled from the classroom, and into the river of students leaving the school, then made my way down to the student parking lot.</p>
   <p>Out of all of us from the orphanage, Ronnie had gotten a job so that he could get a car. He was gracious enough to give me and the other orphans, Kenny and Sandy, a ride to and from school every day.</p>
   <p>I made my way across the parking lot to where his car was parked. A large group of students were circled around an empty spot next to Ronnie’s car and I knew instantly what was going down.</p>
   <p>They were all chanting in unison, "fight", and I knew that this was not going to end well. Once I was close enough to the crowd, I saw Josh land a punch across Ronnie’s face sending his head smashing into the driver’s side window of his car. The window cracked and blood remained as he fell to the ground.</p>
   <p>Kenny pushed his way through the students and threw a punch at Josh. His fist made contact with Josh’s jaw, sending him to the ground, and blood spraying all over the onlookers. A group of girls called out that it was gross. Ronnie pulled himself from the ground shaking his head and trying to clear the ringing in his ear.</p>
   <p>Josh had back up, the same guys from lunch joined in on the fight making the odds three to one. Ronnie balled his fists so tight that from where I was standing at the back of the crowd I could see his knuckles turning white.</p>
   <p>I tried to yell over the crowd, but my words where lost, and it felt like the people were holding me back as I tried to push my way into the circle to stop the madness. I could see Sandy trying as hard as I was to get to the boys, to help, to stop the bloodshed.</p>
   <p>Josh was picking himself up off the ground, Ronnie waited until he was in a kneeling position before running at him and kicking him in the gut. Josh fell back to the ground coughing.</p>
   <p>One of Josh’s buddies grabbed Ronnie from behind, as another began to pound him in the stomach with his fists over, and over again, blood spraying from his mouth with every hit. The same was being done with Kenny, but after a few hits they dropped him to the ground where he balled up in pain.</p>
   <p>Josh stood, and pushed his hair back out of his eyes, spitting blood onto Ronnie’s shoes.  They held Ronnie up by his underarms, “Do you think that, that girl deserves this kind of a beating? She is nothing man. She will always be nothing.” He spoke as if he were talking to a friend, and then punched him in the face as hard as he could.</p>
   <p>“You’re nothing.” Ronnie coughed painfully. His left eye looked painfully blood shot and was beginning to swell.</p>
   <p>Josh laughed and jostled the crowd around him, “Who here would say that I am nothing? I am worth twice what any of you are worth.” Josh nearly stuck his finger in Ronnie’s eye in anger. The people all around us began chanting <emphasis>Josh, Josh</emphasis>, over and over again. He punched Ronnie in the stomach once again. He yelled into the air making a show of things.</p>
   <p>Josh grinned ear to ear with bloody teeth, fists held high celebrating his victory over Ronnie. His buddies dropped Ronnie to the ground next to where Kenny laid.</p>
   <p> I was finally let loose from the crowd, as everyone lost interest and dispersed. I dropped to my knees next to Ronnie, “What did you think was going to happen?” I looked at his black swollen eye and gently examined his head.</p>
   <p>“I wanted to show him that we are not just going to sit by and take it while he treats you like crap. Besides, Kenny had my back.” He smiled with red teeth.</p>
   <p>“I wasn’t going to just let him beat on you man.” Kenny’s head was lying in Sandy’s lap. Kenny had less facial damage, but he strained to speak.</p>
   <p>“Grace, I will never just sit by and let something like that just keep happening. I care about you; I care about all of you more than that. You all deserve to be treated with respect.” He pushed himself up off the ground slowly and made for his keys. They were in the grass in front of his car. When he found them he looked at me to pick them up off the ground.</p>
   <p>“Well, it was stupid.” I helped him stand up straight and walk to his car.</p>
   <p>“That’s beside the point.” He joked, opening his door, and getting into the car and gently slid into the driver’s seat.</p>

    <p>Chapter 2: Abduction</p>
   </title>
   <p>The drive home from school was short and quiet. We all had to figure out a way to explain what happened to the old lady, the woman who took care of us, no matter what we came up with, she would figure out the truth and we would be punished. She was very strict and she despised fighting.</p>
   <p>We all sighed in relief that she wasn’t home when we pulled in the driveway. She usually went into town to visit with a few of her old friends during the day while we were at school. We all went inside, Kenny walked up the stairs slowly to the boy’s bathroom, and Ronnie went downstairs to the girl’s.</p>
   <p>The house was separated into three levels. The top floor was where the boy’s rooms and bathroom were. The middle had the living room, kitchen, dining room, the old lady’s bedroom, and other various utility rooms. I never understood why, but the girls were downstairs, I always assumed it was some kind of joke.</p>
   <p>Strictly speaking, the boys were never allowed in the basement, and vice versa, but when the old lady was away we hardly ever followed the rules. I knocked on the girl’s bathroom door.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” Ronnie spit blood into the sink.</p>
   <p>I opened the door slowly. Ronnie stood in front of the sink with his shirt off, covered from his neck to his waist in bruises, and his face swelling quickly. The sink had a small puddle of blood sitting in the bowl. “Are you alright?”</p>
   <p>“I’ll live.” He ran some water over a cut on his fist. I wondered if he was going to need stitches.</p>
   <p>“Why did you do that Ronnie?” I leaned on the door frame.</p>
   <p>He chuckled and washed his face, “Grace, you are not worthless. You are worth ten times any one of those assholes. You need to realize that.” He turned and placed his hand on my face. He looked into my eyes and I could feel what was going to happen next, so I turned away from him.</p>
   <p>“The old lady will be home soon.” I cleared my throat. I walked out of the room without another word.</p>
   <p>Upstairs in the living room Kenny was sprawled out on the couch watching TV. I pushed his foot out of the way; he winced with every movement, and sat down next to him. It was some sitcom, on a comedy channel.</p>
   <p>“What’s the damage?” I wasn’t interested in the show on the TV.</p>
   <p>“Mostly bruising, I think, nothing that some pampering won’t fix.” He smiled knowing that I would take care of him.</p>
   <p>“Don’t count on it, the old lady is going to work your butt off this weekend because of this, and you know it.” I smiled back shooting a hole in his weekend plans of lying around and doing nothing. His grin vanished as he came to realize that I was right. He would have at least double the chores that he normally had, if she went light on us.</p>
   <p>Sandy came in from the kitchen, and sat down in an empty arm chair, “I just got off the phone with the old lady, and she said that the school called her about the fight. It turns out that when Ronnie kicked Josh in the stomach he broke three of his ribs; he is in the hospital right now.” Satisfaction washed over all of us, but we quickly realized the hell we would soon be in.</p>
   <p>“Who cares about Josh, how mad was the old lady?” Kenny started to flip through the channels.</p>
   <p>“Well, I tried to explain the whole situation to her, but she didn’t care. I think that the both of you are going to be in some deep crap for a while.” Sandy left the room ducking into her bedroom.</p>
   <p>“I don’t care, Josh won’t try anything like that again with you Grace.” Ronnie walked across the sitting room and went up the stairs. A few moments later his bedroom door slammed shut.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>The old lady was home before the next show could start and she was quiet, which was never a good sign. She cooked dinner without uttering a word, allowing the tension to build. At one point she walked up stairs and knocked on Ronnie’s door, but he didn’t answer.</p>
   <p>We all sat around the table for dinner, minus Ronnie, who never came out of his room. I thought that after getting beat so bad, he would want some food but he never came down.</p>
   <p>“It does not matter if someone is making fun of you or anything like that you never fight. I have to fill out all kinds of paper work on every issue that comes up, and fighting is no different.” The old lady passed the pasta around the table.</p>
   <p>None of us said anything; we just ate and let her lecture on about all the work that she has to do to keep us here. It always seemed to me that we were more trouble than we were worth; but once I caught a glimpse of one of her paychecks from the government. It was well worth the headache. That didn’t stop her from complaining though.</p>
   <p>The three of us cleaned up the meal while the old lady got comfortable in front of the TV. I always hated the crap that she wanted to watch, so I went to get ready for bed right after our chores were finished.</p>
   <p>I took a hot shower. Before I left the bathroom I stopped in front of the mirror. I looked at my face and thought about what Ronnie had said. He thought that I am not worthless.</p>
   <p>I had no idea. I had no idea at all about anything. I didn’t know what I was doing. I didn’t know why I turned away from Ronnie, I knew that he was going to kiss me, but I felt like we shouldn’t. We didn’t fit right together at all. He was nice, loving, but more like a brother.</p>
   <p>I looked over at the hand towel that was still soaked in his blood. I couldn’t understand why someone could have feelings for me. I closed my eyes and decided that thinking about it wasn’t going to solve anything.</p>
   <p>My room was always cold; the hot air never seemed to make it all the way down. I climbed into my bed and pulled the covers up to my arms. I turned my computer on and started some music that helped me sleep. The food was heavy in my stomach making me sleepy, but making it hard for me to get comfortable. I tossed and turned for a while.</p>
   <p>I heard a soft knock on my door. I turned over to look at my clock. It was two in the morning, “What?”</p>
   <p>“Can I come in?” The door was cracked and I could see Ronnie’s eye in the doorway.</p>
   <p>“I guess.” I pushed myself up into a sitting position, "its kind of late isn’t it?”</p>
   <p>“I know but I wanted to talk to you.” He seemed kind of weird.</p>
   <p>“Can’t this wait till morning?”</p>
   <p>“Come on.”</p>
   <p>“I’m all ears.” I rubbed my eyes and gave him all of the attention that I could muster in my half sleeping state.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry that I came on so strong. I just want you to remember that you are a wonderful person and you don’t need to let anyone take advantage of you.” He sat on the end of my bed.</p>
   <p>“Ronnie, I am thankful for what you did for me. It was stupid, but I understand why you did it. Don’t think twice about what happened earlier. You surprised me, and I’m just not ready for that kind of relationship yet. I’ve seen all these kids at our school rushing through love, and I want to take things slowly.” I took his hand, “I want to get out of this place, and out on my own. Want to meet my parents? Sorry, I don’t have any…”</p>
   <p>Ronnie smiled and stood up.</p>
   <p>“What? What are you smiling for?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, nothing.” He turned to walk out of the room, and as he reached for the door knob, the door flew open knocking him to the floor with enough force to send him sliding across the floor.</p>
   <p>“Ronnie!” I yelled, as a man in a long, black coat, helmet, and night vision goggles shot at Ronnie with a gun. It wasn’t a real gun, it was far too quiet, but he turned it on me next, and shot me in the stomach.</p>
   <p>“We have units one and two.” The man said.</p>
   <p>I looked down at the dart and everything started to go black. My head hit the ground, and shortly thereafter everything was dark.</p>

    <p>Chapter 3: Dr. Cid</p>
   </title>
   <p>When I opened my eyes I couldn’t see anything. The room was not lit very well but when I moved my arm, two lights above me flickered on. My eyes burned a little when the light hit them so I covered my face with my arm.</p>
   <p>I was half lying on a steel bench and half lying on a concrete floor. I had whole body chills from my head to my toes from the damp cold in the room. The room itself was divided down the center by a wall of thick metal bars. The only way in or out of the room was on the other side of those bars.</p>
   <p>Kenny was lying on the bench next to me. He was beginning to stir.</p>
   <p>Ronnie was lying on the ground next to the bars and Sandy crumpled in a heap on the other side of Kenny.</p>
   <p>“How long have you been awake?” Kenny sat up squinting around the room.</p>
   <p>“Not long.” I pulled my legs up onto the bench with me and wrapped my arms around my knees. I rubbed my arms trying to warm up.</p>
   <p>“What the hell is going on?” He felt his way around the edge of the room while his eyes finished adjusting. He took hold of the bars in the center of the room with both of his hands and tried to shake them.</p>
   <p>“This isn’t like the cell in the police station back home.” He smirked. He had been locked up one time overnight because he had stolen a car to go for a quick joyride. That is what he told the police anyway; he was really trying to run away.</p>
   <p>“What’s different?”</p>
   <p>“These bars are about three times thicker and I’m not sure, but I think these might be made of carbon fiber.”</p>
   <p>“Fascinating.” I let my head fall onto my arm. I didn’t care if this cell was identical to the cell in the police station back home.</p>
   <p>“On top of that, these people are a lot more interested in what’s going on in here.” He pointed around the room to four different cameras that cover every square inch of the room.</p>
   <p>“Ugh, why are we here? What have we done?” I threw my head back against the wall just a little too hard. I closed my eyes as my head was flooded with a head ache.</p>
   <p>“Do you remember anything from the ride here?” Kenny paced around the room.</p>
   <p>“No, not really. I woke up once or twice. Once I know we were in a truck piled up in the middle of the floor. The road was rough. The other time I opened my eyes, it didn’t feel like we were moving, and I couldn’t see anything. Everything was blurry.” I couldn’t get warm no matter what I tried.</p>
   <p>“I think we were on an aircraft.”</p>
   <p>“Where are we?” Ronnie spoke through clenched teeth. He shifted his body to lean against the bars, coughing with each movement.</p>
   <p>“Your guess is as good as ours.” I said.</p>
   <p>Kenny walked over to where Sandy lay and sat down beside her head. He gently lifted it and placed it in his lap. Then he began to stroke her hair.</p>
   <p>“I think under the circumstances all we can do is wait.” He said.</p>
   <p>“How do you feel?” I asked Ronnie.</p>
   <p>He held onto his gut and clenched tighter with each movement.</p>
   <p>“Horrible, and I’m not sure what did the most damage, the door, or Josh’s beat down.”</p>
   <p>“Before you came down to my room did you notice anything out of the ordinary?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Nothing, and I was outside before I came down to your room.” He rubbed his eyes, “I waited for the old woman to go to bed before sneaking into the house.”</p>
   <p>“The old lady…” I paused, “I wonder what she is going to do about all of this?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that we can count on her doing anything.” Sandy remained still and kept her eyes closed.</p>
   <p>“Why is that?” Ronnie asked.</p>
   <p>“I was still awake as they tossed me into the truck. They torched the house and I didn’t see the old woman anywhere.” She explained.</p>
   <p>We all took a few moments of silence for the old woman. None of us really liked her, but she did take care of us for the most part. We had lived in that house for several years.</p>
   <p>Ronnie broke that silence, “We’ll say a prayer when we get out of here, but for now we need to find out what is going on.” He pulled himself up with the bars. “LET’S GET THIS OVER WITH!” he yelled into one of the cameras.</p>
   <p>As if on cue, the door leading out of the room clicked loudly.</p>
   <p>Ronnie took a few steps back. Kenny stood and helped Sandy to her feet.</p>
   <p>“I think someone heard you.” I joined the others.</p>
   <p>We waited for the door to open. Three men entered the room. Two burly men wearing armor and combat head gear came in first.</p>
   <p>The third man was normal sized, much smaller than the first two. He wore a lab coat, had slicked back shiny black hair, and glasses that were almost invisible to the naked eye. He looked older and he had an almost trustable face.</p>
   <p>We didn’t trust him.</p>
   <p>He walked to the bars and looked us up and down like zoo animals. I felt over whelming disgust with the way that he looked at me.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” I asked as his eyes returned to me for a second time.</p>
   <p>The man in the lab coat sighed and scratched his forehead, “My name is Doctor Cid. I am your mentor.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean mentor?”</p>
   <p>“It means that while you’re here you are my responsibility.”</p>
   <p>“What are you talking about?” Ronnie took a step towards the dividing wall.</p>
   <p>“Ah, thank you Mr. Ayers for volunteering to be the first one to find out.” He pointed to Ronnie, “Take him.”</p>
   <p>Dr. Cid took one last look at all of us, turned, and left the room.</p>
   <p>The two guards presented their thumbs for a scan at the door that crossed into our side of the room. The lock clicked.</p>
   <p>The first guard dropped his rifle and pulled out a pistol. He aimed it at me.</p>
   <p>The second guard entered the cell. He grabbed Ronnie, who didn’t fight.</p>
   <p>“Whatever happens…” but he stopped.</p>
   <p>The guard directed Ronnie out of the room.</p>
   <p>I yelled in frustration.</p>
   <p>“WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?”</p>
   <p>“Grace calm down!” Kenny said through his teeth.</p>
   <p>“Calm down?” I shook my head and paced around the cell, “They just took Ronnie and you want me to calm down!”</p>
   <p>“I want you to be rational. What are you going to accomplish by throwing a temper tantrum?” He embraced Sandy.</p>
   <p>I dropped to one of the benches and hugged my knees.</p>
   <p>We sat in silence, and waited for what was going to happen next. I laid down on the bench and covered my face with my arm. I tried to clear my head. I tried not to think about all of the horror movies that I had watched, and what they could possibly be doing to Ronnie at that moment.</p>
   <p>I could hear whispers between Kenny and Sandy. Mostly he was trying to calm her down. She was freaked out about what was going on and my outburst didn’t help things.</p>
   <p>The silence was broken suddenly by the pain filled yells of Ronnie. The worst most gut wrenching screaming that I had ever heard in my life issued from the walls themselves. I had never heard him yell let alone scream like he was being gutted.</p>
   <p>The screaming went on and on for what seemed like forever.</p>
   <p>Sandy sobbed into Kenny’s shoulder and he looked horrified. They both looked up to Ronnie as a big brother, a protector.</p>
   <p>Just as I did.</p>

    <p>Chapter 4: Injection</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ronnie’s screams eventually stopped. I began to pace the room; I knew that they would be in shortly to get their next victim.</p>
   <p>“Whenever they comeback, don’t say anything. The both of you just sit there and shut up.” I knelt down in front of Kenny and Sandy.</p>
   <p>The door clicked.</p>
   <p>I stood and watched as Dr. Cid and the two guards came through the door.</p>
   <p>“Take the girl next, the red head.”</p>
   <p>Both guards drew their pistols and shot darts into Kenny and Sandy. They both fell to the floor.</p>
   <p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
   <p>The cell door swung open and one of the guards came after me. I decided that I wasn’t going to go without a fight. I threw my left fist at the guards face. When my fingers made contact, I immediately felt my bones shatter.</p>
   <p>I screamed.</p>
   <p>He barely even moved.</p>
   <p>He grabbed my shoulder and pushed me out of the cell. The other guard locked the cell door. They pushed me out into the hallway.</p>
   <p>I cradled my hand.</p>
   <p>“What are you going to do with me?” I was directed down the overly white hallways. Bright florescent lights lined both sides of the hallway; burning my eyes.</p>
   <p>No one said anything. One of the guards pushed me in the back with his rifle. I stumbled and hit the wall. I pushed myself back up and kept walking.</p>
   <p>We stopped at a large round door. Dr. Cid slid a keycard, presented his thumb for a scan, and presented his retina for a second scan. The door split down the center, and slid into the walls on either side.</p>
   <p>They pushed me into the room.</p>
   <p>Several machines lined the walls around the room and in the dead center was an operating table. A half dozen other doctors rushed around the room taking readings from all of the equipment.</p>
   <p>“Lay down.” Dr. Cid pointed to the table.</p>
   <p>“No.” I kept as calm as I could, holding my ground.</p>
   <p>He snapped his fingers. One of the guards wrapped his fingers around my throat, and picked me up off the ground. He dropped me on the table.</p>
   <p>The doctors strapped me down to the table. I didn’t fight, I could hardly breathe.</p>
   <p>“Things are going to be so much easier if you don’t fight.” Dr. Cid typed on a tablet.</p>
   <p>“Piss off.” I hissed through gritted teeth.</p>
   <p>“Why do you insist on fighting?”</p>
   <p>“Oh I don’t know, maybe it has something to do with the screaming from Ronnie.” I coughed and fought at the bindings.</p>
   <p>A nurse pulled up my sleeve, and rubbed my skin with an alcohol pad. She filled a syringe with a red liquid and made sure the needle worked. She pushed the needle into my skin and injected the liquid into my vein.</p>
   <p>“What is that? What are you doing to me?” I demanded.</p>
   <p>She pulled the needle out and turned away ignoring my questions. She picked up another vial, a new needle, and injected a blue liquid into my neck. She pulled the needle out and set it on the table.</p>
   <p>The pain in my hand began to subside.</p>
   <p>“Alright, let’s move her into stage one.”</p>
   <p>Two doctors rolled a machine to the top of the table and locked it into place. They took two needles and pressed them into my arms. Another doctor moved in and pulled tubing from the machine and snapped them onto the freshly inserted the needles.</p>
   <p>“Ready for fusion.” The doctor said.</p>
   <p>The machine began to hum loudly; blue light shown from behind my head. Dark red liquid flowed through the right tube, and a dark green liquid moved through the left. They both entered my skin at the same moment.</p>
   <p>I didn’t feel anything at first but that didn’t last. My blood began to boil. I shrieked in pain as more and more of the foreign chemical was pumped into my body. I thrashed against my bindings and screamed as my skin burned.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing to me?” I yelled in between screams.</p>
   <p>“Grace dear, we are making you better.” Dr. Cid smiled.</p>
   <p>I yelled, I screamed, I cried.</p>
   <p>I wanted to tear the flesh from my bones.</p>
   <p>Darkness began to push in around the edge of my mind and I was happy to let it come. I laid my head back and closed my eyes.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, but we can’t let you go to sleep just yet.” Dr. Cid pressed a button on his tablet. A jolt of electricity came through the table and in to my body.</p>
   <p>My eyes burst open and I screamed again.</p>
   <p>“Please! When is it going to stop?”</p>
   <p>Blood ran from my wrists and ankles as I thrashed at the bindings. I prayed for my mind to shut down. I wished that everything would be done with; over.</p>
   <p>I wanted to be dead.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>When I woke I didn’t open my eyes. I wasn’t sure that I wanted to know what was going to happen next. The room was cold. I was lying on a thin mat, that didn’t form any kind of barrier between me and the cold metal below me.</p>
   <p>I looked at my hand. The bones were in pieces, but as I felt it there was no pain. It was as if the incident had never happened.</p>
   <p>I turned my head to the side and blinked. There was a pair of feet.</p>
   <p>“Sandy?” I turned my head slowly to look at her face.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, my name is not Sandy. It’s Rachel.” The girl said kneeling down to bring her face to the same level as mine. She pushed her dirty blond hair out of her face. She was at least my age, but she looked like she hadn’t had a decent meal in months.</p>
   <p>I looked around the room; it was only me and Rachel. I was sure that they had already gotten to Sandy and Kenny. The room was small; there was the bed, which is what I was sitting on, a toilet with a small sink on top of the bowl, and a door. Enough room for me to stand. If I had stuck out both of my arms they would both found a wall.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” I leaned against the wall and rubbed my neck.</p>
   <p>“I am like you, part of this project.” She sat on the ground, and leaned on the opposite wall.</p>
   <p>“What was that stuff that they pumped into my body?” I hoped that she had some answers.</p>
   <p>“Sorry again. I don’t have anything for you. I just wanted to warn you.” She stood and moved into the center of the room.</p>
   <p>“Warn me about what?” I looked up at her face, the light from above her burning my eyes.</p>
   <p>“They are about to do something to you, I don’t have time to explain what. You need to let your emotions take over, let whatever bubbles up around the edge take over.” She looked scared.</p>
   <p>“What in heaven’s name are you talking about?”</p>
   <p>“Just remember to let your emotions take over and things will get better for all of us.” She said, “Oh, and the others that you came here with, they are all fine. They have all been through the injection and are in separate cells on this level.”</p>
   <p>I let my head fall down into my hands, and rubbed my eyes. I wasn’t sure if I was going to be able to take much more.</p>
   <p>When I looked up she had vanished.</p>
   <p>I jumped up and looked around. I ran my hands over the door, but I was sure that if it had opened I would have heard it, the metal was thick.</p>
   <p>I sat back down, ghosts, what next?</p>

    <p>Chapter 5: Heat</p>
   </title>
   <p>My head was killing me and the quiet in the room was not helping. I spent most of my time switching from sitting on the bench, pacing around the room, and laying down. I counted the lines in the ceiling hundreds of times. Each thud of my heart was like a boulder crashing onto my skull.</p>
   <p>I thought of the girl who had vanished into thin air. She had said that her name was Rachel and she knew that the others were alright. I wondered if she had been a figment of my imagination that I had created to ease my mind.</p>
   <p>It hadn’t helped.</p>
   <p>Several times sporadically a small slide halfway up the wall would open. Someone would place a protein bar in an unmarked wrapper and a bottle of water on the small shelf below the slide.</p>
   <p>I ignored it the first half a dozen times. When it became clear that they would take the food if I didn’t eat it coupled with the fact that I didn’t know how long I was going to be there, I decided that I should at least drink the water. Then I gave in when my stomach was louder than my heart beat and began to eat the bars.</p>
   <p>They were extremely bland but I didn’t feel hungry after I ate them.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“Stand up and face away from the door. Place your hands on the back of your head.” A man’s voice issued from the speaker in the wall.</p>
   <p>I sat still on the bench contemplating if submission was a healthier option at this point. The message was repeated with a harsher tone.</p>
   <p>I stood and did as the voice ordered.</p>
   <p>The wall beside the door hissed loudly, and the gears creaked loudly as it moved into the wall. I could feel the floor shake as the massive door moved.</p>
   <p>The man grabbed my hands, wrapped a zip tie around my wrists, and pulled it tight. He pushed me out of the room with a great deal of force. “This way.” He barked.</p>
   <p>“Where are you taking me?” I knew that each and every word was a waste of time and energy.</p>
   <p>“Dr. Cid wants to make you show.” Someone said behind me. It didn’t sound like the guard. I turned to look, and try to see who had spoken, but the guard forced my head forward.</p>
   <p>A skinny man wearing a black silk shirt and pressed pants came out of nowhere and walked right beside me.</p>
   <p>“He can’t see me or hear me.” The skinny man smiled.</p>
   <p>“Wha…” I started, but he shook his head.</p>
   <p>“You don’t want them digging around in your head.”</p>
   <p>I nodded.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about who I am, just listen.”</p>
   <p>Nod.</p>
   <p>“This oaf is going to take you into a room and lock a door behind you. There is a device built into the ceiling called a Kinetic brain wave inducer. I don’t know how it works, but it’s painful. On top of that, the walls and the floor of the room are electrified. They will be using this combination to force you to show.</p>
   <p>My advice to you is to react as quickly as possible but hold back your power. This will end the procedure and label you as low tiered.”</p>
   <p>We arrived at the door. The guard slid a keycard into the lock and waited for a click. He opened the door and pushed me into the room. There was no light at all in the room. He cut the zip ties and pulled the door shut.</p>
   <p>I was plunged into almost complete darkness.</p>
   <p>The skinny man was in the room with me but he began to fade.</p>
   <p>“What are you?” I hissed under my breath.</p>
   <p>“Remember!” he said as he completely disappeared.</p>
   <p>I paced around the room. I knew that I had lost my mind, or this was some way that it was trying to cope with what was happening. The only thing that poked holes in that theory was that most people, who are crazy, think that they are sane.</p>
   <p>“New cell, huh?” I yelled at the walls.</p>
   <p>All of the lights in the room ignited at once scorching my retinas. The walls were lined with bay windows that housed several people varying from scientists to businessmen.</p>
   <p>Dr. Cid sat at the center.</p>
   <p>“Here we have Subject 297. I am her mentor. This product has great potential. Once behavior modification is complete she could fetch a premium.” He kept his eyes locked on one particular man desperately searching for approval.</p>
   <p>“I’m not a damn product!”</p>
   <p>“And on that note, let us begin.”</p>
   <p>Above my head a disk like device began to glow blue. Pulsating hums filled the room as the back of my brain began to burn with a searing pain.</p>
   <p>My mind began to race with what I should do. I was torn between two strangers or delusions, one begged me to lose control, and the other advised me to contain myself.</p>
   <p>I fell to my knees and yelled, trying to tear at the back of my skull. It felt as if a knife had slid into my brain just between my eyes.</p>
   <p>Two meters on the walls began to fill with red light. Once full, my entire body locked up every muscle contracting at once as an electric pulse ripped through me.</p>
   <p>“What do you want me to do? I’ll do anything, just make it stop!” I screamed at the top of my lungs, as more and more electricity blasted through my flesh.</p>
   <p>I closed my eyes and rested my head on the ground unable to hold it up any longer.</p>
   <p><emphasis>All of the noise was gone.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I was sure that I was dead.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I opened my eyes to blinding white sunlight. The ground below me was sand. I was kneeling in a desert. I slowly and painfully pushed myself up onto my feet. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>When my eyes adjusted, someone stood at the edge of my vision just far enough away to be a blurry figure. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I took a few steps toward the figure, but it just moved away, each movement matching mine. I began to run at the figure, and the figure began to run. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Heat seared all around me. My skin felt like it was melting away.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Suddenly the figure stopped running and turned towards me. I stopped in my tracks and just watched; waiting to see what was going to happen. As it came closer I could see her long, flowing red hair, the wind blowing it around like flames flowing from the back of her head. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She came closer; but still she remained blurred.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She slowed and walked to within inches of where I stood. As if someone had flipped a switch, she became crystal clear. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>It was me.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I was standing inches from my own face and I was on fire. My head and my hands burned with yellow/orange flames. I looked down at my own hands and they too were on fire.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I freaked out and started trying to pat out the fire on my legs. </emphasis></p>
   <p>I opened my eyes once again when I realized that the fire didn’t hurt. I was back in the room. My hands were still ablaze and I panicked once again.</p>
   <p>I screamed, but realized that it was like putting my hands into warm water. I walked over to the window and placed my hand on the window that Dr. Cid sat behind.</p>
   <p>“Is this what you want?” I yelled as the glass began to melt. I didn’t let my emotions take over like the girl had asked me to. I was afraid of what was going to happen.</p>
   <p>Before I could do anymore damage, fire extinguishers put out my flames. I began to feel sleepy. I fell against the wall and slid down to the floor blacking out.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>When I woke I slammed my head into the bench and sighed loudly. I was getting fed up with the constant black outs. I had more questions and fewer answers. My head was buzzing like never before.</p>
   <p>Rachel was sitting on the floor beside the bed. She looked disappointed, “You didn’t let your emotions take over.”</p>
   <p>“To be honest I don’t know what I should do. Someone else told me to hold back.”</p>
   <p>“I told her to hold back.” The skinny man was leaning against the door.</p>
   <p>“Why did you tell her to hold back?” Rachel stood got into his face.</p>
   <p>“Because, if she had lost control on her first time it could have killed her.” He leaned to look at me over Rachel’s shoulder, “I’m Zach by the way.”</p>
   <p>“But Zach, she has so much power! I don’t think that this is her first time.”</p>
   <p>“Does anyone feel that I should be clued in on what is going on?” I sat up on the bench.</p>
   <p>“The world as you know it… it’s a front.” Zach sat down next to me.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean a front?”</p>
   <p>There was a noise just outside of the door.</p>
   <p>“Got to go.” They both vanished into thin air.</p>
   <p>The food door slid open and the normal was placed on the shelf. I reached up, took the water, and chugged every last drop.</p>
   <p>I laid back down and closed my eyes.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I didn’t see Rachel or Zach again before a guard returned to take me away. He took me to the same room and practically shoved me onto my face into the testing room.</p>
   <p>Dr. Cid was there again and they hadn’t fixed my hand print that I had melted into the glass.</p>
   <p>“And today we have 297, this is the second time you have seen her. She is tier two. We might be able to sell her as foot soldier.” He took a deep breath. “Frankly I am baffled as to why you would want to see her use her abilities again.”</p>
   <p>“Enough Doctor Cid; begin the procedure.” One of the onlookers said very calmly.</p>
   <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
   <p>Everything happened as it had before. It took a while longer for the pain to reach the same height as it had the first time.</p>
   <p><emphasis>When I opened my eyes I was back in the desert. The light was still searing, but the heat didn’t bother me. The reflection of me was much closer this time. I had a distinct feeling of creepiness as I looked at myself. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She reached out for me. She was quickly being consumed by flame. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I reached out my hands, but there was a resistance like opposing magnets pushing against me. I thought about what Rachel had said about everything being better for everyone if I let my emotions take over. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I let the hatred for the pain flow into my veins. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The resistance disappeared and I fell forward into the reflection of myself. We became one and the flames spread across my body. The flames changed from dark orange, yellow, to bright blue, then to white. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I closed my eyes.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I was completely engulfed in white flames. I felt nothing but a warm rushing sensation over my skin.</p>
   <p>I ran, yelling towards the window in front of me. Dr. Cid was my target, and he jumped as the white flames blasted through the glass. The floor disintegrated beneath me as I rose into the air letting the flames pour from my body.</p>
   <p>The ceiling dissolved as I flew higher and then I was outside in the night breathing the fresh air that I hadn’t in so long. I watched as the fire, which almost looked like magma, flowed from my skin like water from a fresh spring. I was completely helpless to slow the movement nor could I stop the destruction that my flames were causing.</p>
   <p>I screamed in anger as the flames blasted into a pillar above me as high as I could see.</p>
   <p>The flames vanished and I fell to the ground like a stone. My body crumpled in a heap in the dirt below.</p>
   <p>As the world went dark around me, I felt something warm wrap around my body as my mind began to go blank.</p>
   <p>“You did well.” I heard as the darkness took over.</p>

    <p>Chapter 6: Powers</p>
   </title>
   <p>The truck seat was very comfortable compared to the benches in the cells. I didn’t open my eyes because my head was killing me. Searing pain burned between my eyes. The sun in front of the truck was shining through my eye lids forcing me to turn over in the seat. I decided that it was time to face the music.</p>
   <p>I opened my eyes.</p>
   <p>Ronnie was driving the truck and I was in the passenger seat. Sandy and Kenny where sitting in the seats just behind us; a wave of relief flooded over me to see that they were relatively unharmed. Behind them sat Rachel and two children who were unknown to me.</p>
   <p>“Where are we?” My voice was scratchy and my throat was dry. I suddenly became aware that I was wearing only a lab coat and a blanket.</p>
   <p>“We haven’t stopped to check yet, but according to the signs we are heading north. I saw a sign thanking us for leaving Las Vegas and to come back soon.” Ronnie stole a glance but quickly returned his eyes to the road.</p>
   <p> "So what is the plan?” my skin stuck to the seat with the heat from the sun.</p>
   <p>“Well now that you are awake, I think we will stop at the next gas station and fuel up. Oh, and try and get you some clothes.” He smiled.</p>
   <p>I was willing to bet he was as happy as a pig in slop that moment.</p>
   <p>“So are you a real person, or are you just following me in my head?” I looked at Rachel in the mirror.</p>
   <p>“I am a real person. I promise.” She leaned forward to speak.</p>
   <p>“How did you know that was going to happen?” I turned around to look at her.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t know that was exactly what would happen. But I could see in your mind. I could see the power building inside. More power than I have ever felt before.” She smiled.</p>
   <p>“You could see into my mind?” I said sarcastically.</p>
   <p>“Ah, yeah it’s one of my abilities.” she said, "We all have them now.”</p>
   <p>I looked to Ronnie and he nodded. He turned the blinker on to exit the highway. The travel center that we pulled into was bustling with traffic, it seemed like the only place for miles to stop and get fuel, among other things.</p>
   <p>“We’ll talk about all of this later.” He pulled into a line for a gas pump.</p>
   <p>“How do you expect to pay for all of this?” I double checked that I was covered as he pulled up to an available pump.</p>
   <p>“I took the wallets from the guys that we borrowed the truck from. Between them, we got eight hundred bucks cash and a few credit cards.” Kenny’s voice rang from the back seat. I was happy to hear his voice again.</p>
   <p>Everyone but me filed out of the truck pretending we were one big happy family on vacation. I rolled down the window and stuck my head out. Ronnie stood next to the pump sliding one of the credit cards from the stack into the card reader.</p>
   <p>“Don’t forget my clothes.” The fresh air felt freeing on my face; the truck was kind of stuffy.</p>
   <p>“Rachel and Sandy are on it.” He flipped up the lever on the pump. The gas started to flow and the smell started to waft to the front of the truck. I sat back and rolled up my window. I reached over and turned on the radio, the silence was like a knife cutting into my head.</p>
   <p>I surfed a few stations before I came to one claiming to be Las Vegas News XM. I turned it up and listened to the reporter, "The explosion that rocked Las Vegas last night went unexplained for almost fifteen hours as Aurora Corporation representatives declined interviews. Many people witnessed the enormous pillar of flame that blasted into the sky. We spoke to a paramedic who was reluctant to comment, but came forward in the end. He reported that there were four deaths and over a hundred injuries reported on site, however, Aurora refused paramedic assistance stating that it was in each employee’s contract to receive any, and all medical care from Aurora medical personnel.” She stopped for a breath.</p>
   <p>“I am here now with Aurora Representative Rebecca Scott. Mrs. Scott, is Aurora ready to explain what happened here last night?” The reporter waited.</p>
   <p>“Well at approximately fifteen after two in the morning, an experimental reactor, that has been contracted by the Nevada government to subsidize The Hoover Dam in power generation, went critical because of a minor malfunction in a piece of hardware created outside of the Aurora corporation. We have already assessed the issued, and the company that built the component has been dealt with and an alternative has been located and repair of the reactor will begin within two days.” The representative explained. It sounded like she was reading from a script.</p>
   <p>“Are there any fears of radiation or any type of health concerns from the explosion?” the reporter asked.</p>
   <p>“Fortunately the reactor that we are constructing is completely environmentally friendly and there is zero risk to anyone who lives near the reactor. As a matter of fact, a majority of the onsite workers that were not critically injured in the explosion have opted to return to work immediately.”</p>
   <p>Someone knocked on my window, and when I turned to look, Rachel stood outside of my door holding up a shopping bag. I opened the door and made sure the lab coat was covering my body.</p>
   <p>“There wasn’t a lot to choose from.” Rachel held the bag open.</p>
   <p>“I don’t care, I just need some clothes.” I snatched the bag. We walked over to the bathrooms that were on the outside of the building. Rachel and Sandy tried their best to block me from the view of onlookers, but I still got dirty looks from all directions. I had a flash of frustration wondering why people couldn’t mind their own business. I opened the door and held my nose walking into the small bathroom, and locked the door behind me.</p>
   <p>I opened the bag and took out the pants and underwear. The pants were blue jeans, but they were men’s and at least three sizes too large. They did, however, have the foresight to get me a belt. I had to pull it all the way to the last notch folding the waist of the pants as I went.</p>
   <p>The shirt was obnoxiously red and on the front in gold glittery lettering it read, <emphasis>Hope you enjoyed the Slots!</emphasis> It fit better than the pants. I thanked God that there was a hoodie at the bottom of the bag that I could wear over the ugly shirt. I put it on and shoved the lab coat into the bag.</p>
   <p>I stopped before I left the bathroom; the mirror had rust cracks all around the edges and was missing a corner. I washed my face and took a look at myself in the mirror. My eyes had changed color. Before all of this they where a dark green but now they were so blue that they were almost glowing. My hair was longer and had changed color to a darker maroon.</p>
   <p>I opened the door stopping in front of Rachel and opening the hoodie, "What the hell were you thinking?”</p>
   <p>“Only ladies shirt in the whole place.” she shrugged.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry Grace.” Sandy stood behind me. I turned around and wrapped my arms around her in a hug. I squeezed as hard as I could.</p>
   <p>“It’s good to see that you are ok.” I let go of her.</p>
   <p>We all walked back to the truck where everyone had already loaded up and were ready to hit the road. I hopped back into the passenger seat and put on my seat belt.</p>
   <p>Ronnie joined the line of vehicles leaving the truck stop. He then pulled back onto the highway making sure to go the opposite way we had come.</p>
   <p>“So did you find out where we are?” I adjusted the sun visor.</p>
   <p>“We are an eight hour drive from home.” He looked over at me while we were stopped at a traffic light.</p>
   <p>“Let’s do it.” I nodded.</p>
   <p>“Alright.” He merged into the lane that would take us home.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that this is a good idea.” Rachel chimed from the back seat.</p>
   <p>“I’m sure that it is a horrible idea, but I would like to see what is left of the orphanage and there are a few people in the town besides the woman who took care of us that we could contact.” I looked back over the seat again.</p>
   <p>“So what is your story Rachel?” Kenny turned to look at her as well. Sandy followed suit.</p>
   <p>“Well it is similar to yours; this is Mike and Mary by the way.” She said pointing to the two others in the back seat. They looked like they were a few years younger than the rest of us.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for freeing us.” Mike said, "My sister hasn’t spoken since they gave her, her abilities.”</p>
   <p>“We were all at a hospital in the intensive care unit, and then we awoke in the Aurora facility.” Rachel tried to recall her abduction.</p>
   <p>“Aurora, wait a minute I just heard on the radio that one of their experimental power generators had exploded, you mean that was me?” I had never thought about putting the accident together with my losing control.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” Rachel nodded.</p>
   <p>“They said that four people were killed and over a hundred were injured.” I turned around and sat back into my seat. I thought about Zach, who wasn’t here with us; I couldn’t help but think that he was one of the people that I had killed.</p>
   <p>“He wasn’t killed.” Rachel said quietly.</p>
   <p>“Ok, ground rule, stay out of my head.” I looked out of the window.</p>
   <p>“Message received.” she sat back looking hurt.</p>
   <p> "She did get us out of there.” Ronnie whispered from the corner of his mouth.</p>
   <p>“I’m glad, but she convinced me to kill people, and I am not happy about that.” I hissed.</p>
   <p>“Grace, she didn’t know you were going to kill anyone.” Ronnie tried to calm me down.</p>
   <p>“You know what…” I almost yelled, but I could see tears welling in her eyes in the mirror, “I don’t want to talk about it.”</p>
   <p>“Alright, alright. I’m hungry, let’s get something to eat.” Kenny’s stomach growl was audible from the front seat.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>We pulled into the imitation burger joint and decided that it would be easier to all go inside instead of the drive thru.</p>
   <p>Altogether we had nine trays of food and we picked a couple of tables in the back. Ronnie, Kenny and Rachel sat with me at one table. Sandy was ok to sit with Mike and Mary.</p>
   <p>“So I think that we should put all of our abilities, or whatever you want to call what they did to us, on the table.” Ronnie took the words out of my mouth, “I think we all have an idea as to what Grace can do.”</p>
   <p>“I have telekinetics and telepathy.” Rachel’s voice issued from inside all of our heads.</p>
   <p>“They decided to call my thing Chronokinetics, which is the ability to manipulate time with my mind. Dr. Cid told one of the guys watching that they had never seen the ability before.” Kenny held up his hands where a golden ball of energy appeared, “That’s all that I can do to demonstrate. They put a clock in and watched it tick backwards.”</p>
   <p>“They called mine Electrokinetics. I’m surprised that I’m not constantly magnetized.” Ronnie held out his hand and showed me the veins on the back of his hand that pulsated with electricity with his heart beat.</p>
   <p>Sandy came over to the table and knelt down beside me, "Metamorphosis.” her hair grew three inches and turned from brown to black, to an unreal green.</p>
   <p>“Now that’s amazing.” I took a bite of my second burger.</p>
   <p>“Those two both have the ability to control water in different states. Mike is better with the liquid form and Mary is better with ice. They also have a constant telepathic link to each other, like a supercharged version of link that normal twins have.” Rachel explained.</p>
   <p>Once we had all finished eating, we took turns in the bathroom, before getting back onto the highway. The sun had gone down and there were far fewer cars on the road.</p>
   <p>“I have another question. How long were we in there?” I looked back to Rachel.</p>
   <p>She shrugged, "I was in there several years.”</p>
   <p>I turned on the GPS that was built into the dashboard of the truck. I flipped through the settings looking for the date and time, but the thing wouldn’t tell me anything until I put in a destination. So I entered the address of the orphanage.</p>
   <p>“You will arrive at your destination at four a.m.” the GPS announced with a British accent. Up in the corner of the GPS the date was <emphasis>7/6/2063</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>I looked up at Ronnie, "We were there a month.”</p>
   <p>“More than a month actually.”</p>
   <p>I sat back in the seat and rubbed my palms into my eyes, feeling a head ache was coming on quickly. Our incarceration had lasted longer than I could have dreamed.</p>
   <p>All I wanted was to be home in my basement bed.</p>

    <p>Chapter 7: Home</p>
   </title>
   <p>We arrived in the small town of Greencrest as the sun was starting to come up over the nearby trees. The town was empty, the streets void of life, but that was completely normal for our home town. There were maybe a total of twenty thousand people in the whole town, and most of those people had to drive to neighboring cities for work.</p>
   <p>We pulled up to the lot where the orphanage used to be located and Ronnie cut the trucks engine.</p>
   <p>We all climbed out and stretched.</p>
   <p>Ronnie and I stared at the lot in an awestruck state. Not only was the house gone, but it looked as if it had never been there to begin with. There was not a spot of evidence, nothing at all, just an empty plot of grass. The gravel driveway and the shed were both gone as well.</p>
   <p>“How can this even be possible?” I asked Ronnie who was knelt down beside where the front door would have been.</p>
   <p>He reached out and felt the grass.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know but I don’t think we need to hang around here too long.” He stood and rubbed his hands together.</p>
   <p>We all agreed.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go down to the diner and see about some breakfast. I am already hungry again.” I rubbed my stomach absent mindedly.</p>
   <p>“Me too.” Kenny chimed in.</p>
   <p>“I overheard, one of the scientists talking about that once. He said that our metabolisms are amped up to like ten times their normal rate to compensate for the extra energy needed to use the abilities.” Rachel recalled.</p>
   <p>“Over heard, or were you in his head?” I hated the idea that she could freely walk around people’s minds.</p>
   <p>“Grace, please, I am really sorry about invading your mind.” She pleaded.</p>
   <p>I considered for a moment and decided to let it go, “Forget it. So, how long were you locked up?”</p>
   <p>“Now that I know the date I have a better idea. Something like ten years.” she looked away and pushing away a tear that cropped up around her eye.</p>
   <p>“You would have had to been what six or seven when they took you? What about your parents?” We all walked down the side walk. Greencrest was a small town, anyone could walk to anywhere in the town, if need be. The diner was only a couple of blocks away from the orphanage. Sandy was going to apply for a job there over the summer.</p>
   <p>“Seven.” she said quietly, “My parents were killed in the same accident that landed me in the ICU.</p>
   <p>“Where did you come from?” Kenny asked.</p>
   <p>“I couldn’t tell you, I’m not sure. I was in and out of it so much while I was there that my memories before that place are all munched up. I can only remember flashes. The twins were only five when we were abducted from the hospital. They know nothing before their abduction.”</p>
   <p>We went into the diner and sat in the corner booth at the back; it was bigger so we could all seven sit around one table. Ronnie counted the cash that we had left and decided that we still had enough for us all to go ahead and get whatever we wanted.</p>
   <p>“We were locked away in that place for more than a month, and I can only remember eating a dozen or so of those nasty protein bars.” I wanted real food more than anything.</p>
   <p>“The caretakers had two ways of dealing with our nutrition. First, there was the protein bars but when I refused to eat, they would fight me to the ground and inject me with something. I don’t know what was in the needle but I was never hungry after a round with that stuff.” Rachel remembered.</p>
   <p>“They hurt.” Mike sat across from me at the far end of the table.</p>
   <p>Mary nodded.</p>
   <p>“I must have been unconscious for a lot more time than I had realized.” I was having the hardest time adjusting to the time gap.</p>
   <p>The waitress came over to our table and started to take everyone’s orders. I ordered a stack of waffles, three eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, and orange juice. Everyone else ordered about the same amount of food.</p>
   <p>“It’s going to take a while; the griddle is just now heating up.” The waitress smiled a fake smile and took all of our menus.</p>
   <p>We all smiled back as she walked away.</p>
   <p>“So what are we going to do next?” Ronnie asked as soon as the waitress was out of earshot.</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure, I think that you and me should go up to the school and see if we are missing, but beyond that I’ve got nothing.” I played with my napkin, it was a habit that I had had since I was a small child.</p>
   <p>“Why just the two of you?” Kenny was upset at being left out.</p>
   <p>“Rachel isn’t from around here like we are and things would go smoother at the school if there were fewer of us poking around. You guys can all go to the store and get some food that we can keep in the truck, maybe some other things that you come across. Some better pants, perhaps.” I pulled on the enormous waist of the men’s pants I was wearing.</p>
   <p>The food arrived in a grand fashion; the waitress had to get the cook’s assistance to carry it all out from the back, and she demanded that we pay for the meal before we ate a single bite.</p>
   <p>Ronnie shelled out the hundred bucks and even though she was rude he gave her a twenty dollar tip. She took the money happily and went along her way.</p>
   <p>We ate in almost complete silence as everyone devoured every bite of food on the table. Normally after eating a meal half that size I would feel sick to my stomach for a few hours, but it all felt just right.</p>
   <p>We left the diner and headed in different directions.</p>
   <p>A small shop that we passed had pay as you go cell phones in the window. Ronnie bought two of them and paid in cash. He opened the packaging and turned on the phone, it had half a battery.</p>
   <p>“To keep up with the time and next time we have to separate, each group can take one.” He set the phone’s clock with the shop’s clock.</p>
   <p>The school was a whole six block walk from the diner. We arrived just a few moments after roll would have been submitted for the first class. We walked up the grass to the front entrance of the school.</p>
   <p>Every morning, the first class of the day took roll call and sent it down to the front office. This file would be on the receptionist’s computer and she would have to input the information into each student’s personal file. I spent a semester working in the office, for credit. The principal thought that it would be good for me to be away from other students and working with adults. He thought that I was mature for my age and that is why I didn’t have many friends outside of the other orphans.</p>
   <p>“Check the file.” Ronnie whispered as he walked up to the receptionist and started to talk to her about something I couldn’t quite hear, and then she escorted him to the back to where the principal’s office was, I took my chance.</p>
   <p>I opened the file on the computer and searched for room two ninety nine. When I found it, I searched for my name. I slid my finger down the screen and there I was. I moved my finger over to status.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Present</emphasis></p>
   <p>I had been present every day that week, according to the file, Monday through Friday. I closed the file, logged off of the computer, and left the office.</p>
   <p>I snuck down the hallway trying my best to avoid the cameras. I went up the stairwell and into the second floor hallway. I slowly raised my eyes to the bottom level of the window on the classroom’s door.</p>
   <p>Some girl was sitting in my spot. I had never seen her before in my life. She was similar to me but there were some differences. Her hair was shorter, for one. She could have been a cousin of mine.</p>
   <p>I went back downstairs where Ronnie waited outside pacing around the entrance.</p>
   <p>“The principal wasn’t in.” He said as I walked up.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, well I was.” I said in a huff.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?”</p>
   <p>“I was counted present in the system, so I went up stairs, and sure enough there was some girl sitting in my seat.” I ran my fingers through my hair.</p>
   <p>“Did she look like you?” He placed a sturdy hand on my shoulder.</p>
   <p>“Not really, I don’t know, Kind of.” I was really starting to freak out.</p>
   <p>We waited around for gym classes to start. Ronnie’s second class was in gym, with me and Josh. Josh always gave me a hard time in that class.</p>
   <p>We snuck in and hid under the bleachers. The class filled in from the showers; the students wore uniforms. A guy that looked similar to Ronnie came from the locker room followed by Josh.</p>
   <p>“Hey Ronnie!” Josh acted as if he were friends with Ronnie. They gave each other a friendly man hug.</p>
   <p>The other me came out of the girl’s locker room and met Josh halfway across the gym. Josh wrapped his arm around her waist.</p>
   <p>“Show some self-respect and get away from that pig.” I growled through my teeth.</p>
   <p>She didn’t, she pulled herself closer and she kissed him, and not a friendly kiss either a loving embrace.</p>
   <p>The coach had to break them apart.</p>
   <p>I wanted to puke.</p>
   <p>I held my stomach and turned to Ronnie, "Let’s get out of this twilight zone hell before I vomit.” I hissed.</p>
   <p>He nodded and we slipped out through the back door. I couldn’t believe what I had just seen. It was horrible. It was awful. Above all it was WRONG.</p>
   <p>We hightailed it back to where the orphanage was but we stopped before we got there. We ducked into a bookstore and acted like we were browsing. There were two cops checking out the truck that we had left parked on the curb next to the empty plot of land. One of the cops was a state trooper.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are we going to do now?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” Ronnie opened a book on how to hypnotize women. I gave him a nasty look. "I just picked up a random book.”</p>
   <p>I looked back out of the window, as a tow truck backed up to the stolen truck. The guy that was hooking our truck up, furious, he knew that the owner wasn’t going to show up to pay the tow bill. Town policy was if you get towed you pay.</p>
   <p>“Are you two going to buy anything or are you just going to stare out of my window?” a woman asked as she sorted through books on her counter.</p>
   <p>Ronnie purchased a guide book on the area and as soon as the cops were gone, we bolted from the store to find the others.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>We met the others at the diner. Kenny’s hands were full of groceries. They were heading back from the market.</p>
   <p>We walked back to the empty plot. We took cover in the woods behind where the house used to sit.</p>
   <p>“Where is the truck?” Rachel noticed it was gone first.</p>
   <p>“It got towed.”</p>
   <p>We sat in quiet and then it hit me like a ton of bricks.</p>
   <p>I jumped up and ran off into the woods.</p>
   <p>I ran deeper into the woods. Ronnie followed yelling for me to come back but I couldn’t. I knew this was the last thing left to prove that we had been here.</p>
   <p>I looked for the clearing and there it was, small with a huge oak growing at the center. The leaves made a perfect roof to keep the weather at bay. When we had our first real summer here after all four of us had arrived we had spent hours in this clearing.</p>
   <p>The old woman never came out here. I looked at the trunk closely and it looked just as it had when we had all carved our names into the bark all those years ago.</p>
   <p>Our names; <emphasis>Ronnie, Kenny, Sandy, Grace </emphasis>around the word <emphasis>Friends</emphasis></p>
   <p>I ran my fingers across the grooves that we had made with Ronnie’s pocket knife; a small relief flooded over my body. Some point in the reality that I could remember, still existed and it made a world of difference.</p>
   <p>There was something I could now ground myself to.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are you doing?” Ronnie was out of breath. He leaned on his knees.</p>
   <p>“Finding proof I was not losing my mind. I had to know that it had been real.” I said turning away from the tree.</p>
   <p>“Give me one of the phones.” I asked holding out my hand.</p>
   <p>Ronnie took the phone from his pocket and handed it over. I opened the camera application and snapped a picture of the carving. With a smile, I turned to leave the clearing wiping a tear of joy from my eye.</p>
   <p>When we returned to the others, I showed them the picture Sandy and Kenny both smiled, as happy as I had been to see the old tree.</p>
   <p>“We need to come up with a plan.” I opened my mouth to continue but the old oak in the woods was blown to pieces. The aircraft responsible slowly hovered around where we stood. Spot lights switched on and shown into our faces.</p>
   <p>“I wonder who this could be.” Ronnie said sarcastically as we all grouped closer together.</p>

    <p>Chapter 8: Vanish</p>
   </title>
   <p>The aircraft, the likes of which I’d never seen before, touched down in front of where we stood. Just behind the cockpit window was an unmistakable Aurora Corporation logo pressed into the metal hull. The side door slid open with a pneumatic hiss. A dozen armed guards marched from the passenger compartment and surrounded our group.</p>
   <p>Two other men walked out onto the grass, one wearing camouflage pants, and a bullet proof vest. The other, a perfectly pressed suit, his hair was slicked black, the grease shown in the moonlight. It was the man that had spoken up the second time Dr. Cid forced me to use my abilities.</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” I asked as pushed my way to the front of the group.</p>
   <p>The man in the suit stepped forward. He adjusted his tie, "Oh, how sorry I am that we have to meet this way, Grace” He looked at his hand as if thinking about an offer to shake, but changed his mind. "My name is James Scott. I am the CEO of the Aurora Corporation.”</p>
   <p>“Good for you.” Ronnie yelled.</p>
   <p>“Now, now there is no need to act that way, I come offering you open arms to come back, and we will forgive and forget this little indiscretion.” James took another step forward.</p>
   <p>“Forget about it.” I yelled.</p>
   <p>“We gave you so much.” James said as if we owed him.</p>
   <p>“We are not going with you.” I looked to everyone for support.</p>
   <p>They all nodded.</p>
   <p>“Have it your way,” he turned to the man beside him, "Kill them, and recover the bodies, we don’t need any of them alive.”</p>
   <p>“Sir.” the man nodded then turned the face of his watch like a dial. James vanished in blurry blue lines.</p>
   <p>“So you’re going to kill us?” Rachel moved up to get a better view.</p>
   <p>“You heard him, we don’t need you alive.” he held up his fist. All of the soldiers around us held up their rifles aiming at us.</p>
   <p>He dropped his hand, pointing at us.</p>
   <p>In unison, all of the men began firing their fully automatic rifles. The bullets flew in all directions but no one was hit. I turned around to see Rachel with her arms out beside her, palms out, her eyes rolled into the back of her head. The bullets were ricocheting off of some kind of force field.</p>
   <p>All of the men began to reload at the same exact moment.</p>
   <p>Ronnie pushed me back and put his hands together. Lightening started to arch between them forming a ball of energy. He threw the ball at one of the men surrounding us, but before it made contact, the leader of the group appeared in front of the energy ball in a blur. He absorbed the blast. He then increased the size of the energy ball and threw it back at Ronnie.</p>
   <p>Ronnie tried to jump out of the way but he wasn’t fast enough. The ball of energy crashed into his side sending him skidding across the grass. Every muscle in his body was contracting at the same time.</p>
   <p>“Hmm… I haven’t met another Electrokinetic with this much power since I killed the last one.” the man laughed, "but I have more.”</p>
   <p>“What did you do to him?” I yelled as Ronnie groaned on the ground.</p>
   <p>“Resume firing!” he ordered his troops.</p>
   <p>The bullets began to rain again.</p>
   <p>I turned to look at Rachel. She was trying not to drop to her knees and slowly her eyes were starting to bleed. The force field began to shrink quickly.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know how long she can keep this up.” Kenny and Sandy were helping Rachel stay on her feet.</p>
   <p>A flash of bright blue light blinded us from the sky. Four people appeared from nothing between us and the Aurora Soldiers.</p>
   <p>“Vanish, get ready for the return trip. Hothead and Silence take out the Sabers.” One of the men ordered.</p>
   <p>Silence moved in a blur cutting through the Sabers. Hothead had taken out two massive blades and began cutting down the Sabers in a blind furry. Quickly the enemy soldiers fell and before long only the leader stood chuckling.</p>
   <p>“Sam it’s been too long.” the leader said.</p>
   <p>“Richard, it seems that you have moved up in the ranks.” Sam, the man leading the newly arrived group yelled at the leader of the Aurora soldiers.</p>
   <p>“Funny you should call me that. It’s not my name anymore. Call me Jolt.”</p>
   <p>“Who the hell are you?” I yelled. I was completely lost in the situation with no idea of what to do.</p>
   <p>“I’m a friend.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>Jolt began to laugh as Silence and Hothead finished taking out the Sabers.</p>
   <p>“What is so funny?” Silence yelled.</p>
   <p>“These Sabers have had an upgrade. Something new the doctors have cooked up, over active production of a supercharged adrenaline. They won’t be stopped that easily.” Jolt held up the head of one of the downed Sabers. They all started to get up off the ground.</p>
   <p>“That’s definitely something new.” Sam started to show a little nervousness.</p>
   <p>I ran over to Rachel who let the force field fall. She was on her knees holding her head in her hands, "if you want to help, now would be a good time.”</p>
   <p>Silence and Hothead were thrust right back into fighting off the wild Sabers. The Sabers moved faster and were predicting their movements.</p>
   <p>Silence was grabbed around the neck and tossed like a rag doll. Hothead swept the legs out from under the Saber, his torso falling to the ground, but it didn’t stop. The torso pulled itself across the ground with its arms to attack Hothead’s legs. Two other Sabers jumped onto Hothead’s back and wrestled him to the ground.</p>
   <p>“I think it’s time to go, Vanish.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>“I’m not ready yet.” She rubbed her hands together.</p>
   <p>“Well you need to get ready. Hothead, Silence, time to wrap things up.” Sam yelled to the two fighting the crowd of soldiers who kept standing back up after getting knocked down.</p>
   <p>Hothead stood with all of the Sabers on his back. He got a hold of one of his blades and swung it blindly. He took out most of them that clung onto his back. Silence slipped out and reappeared behind Sam.</p>
   <p>I stood there helplessly frozen with fear, unable to act. I tried to tap into the power that I had used to break us free, but I couldn’t find it. Not only that, I couldn’t find any power at all.</p>
   <p>I was useless.</p>
   <p> Hothead grabbed the leg of one of the soldiers and stepped on his head, then used him as a sort of bowling ball chucking the limp body to knock down the others around him. He stormed back where we all stood.</p>
   <p>The same bright blue light filled the air and the ground left my feet. All I could see was blue, I could feel everyone around me, but I couldn’t see any of them. I couldn’t see anything.</p>
   <p>The ground was soft and cold.</p>
   <p>“Where are we?” I looked around in darkness.</p>
   <p>“Alaska.” Sam’s voice came from my left, "Everyone ok? Silence, Hothead, Vanish?” He dug through his pockets.</p>
   <p>“Hey guys, there’s something wrong with Vanish.” Silence stood beside where the girl laid on the ground, red snow surrounding her body.</p>
   <p>“LIZ!” Hothead yelled running to her, knocking silence out of his path and skidding to a stop on his knees beside where she lay.</p>
   <p>“Hothead remember your training.” Sam held a cell phone to his ear. He rushed to her side as well, but wasn’t quite as panicked as Hothead, "We’re back. Send a truck, and prep a med team.” He put the phone back into his pocket and knelt down beside the girl’s head. He looked at her face tilting her head side to side very gently.</p>
   <p>“Sam?” Hothead growled at him.</p>
   <p>“The blood is coming from her eyes and mouth. It has to be from overuse of her abilities. She should be alright Hothead.” Sam explained, "Are the rest of you alright?” He asked looking at me, then looking to the rest of the group.</p>
   <p>I checked everyone and we were all alive, very shaken but fine all the same. Ronnie was up and moving around slowly. Rachel was wiping blood from her face with the sleeve of her shirt.</p>
   <p>A large vehicle with tracks instead of wheels came barreling over a nearby hill of snow. We carefully lifted Vanish into the back of the truck and the rest of us piled in around her. We sat on cold metal seats that were around the edge of the inside of the back of the vehicle.</p>
   <p>“So which one of you is the tier six?” Silence glanced around at us.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” I was sitting directly across from him. I couldn’t read his expression because his face was covered. I was suddenly aware that it was freezing and the back of the truck was open.</p>
   <p>“When you use your abilities you give off kinetic brain waves, they can be measured in levels based on how powerful the abilities are. We got a hit in Las Vegas that registered as a six, and that’s rare.” he was extremely excited.</p>
   <p>“Silence, you need to keep quiet until they have been debriefed, we have rules for a reason.” Sam chimed in from the front of the truck.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Sir.” Silence hung his head.</p>
   <p>No one spoke as the vehicle heaved up and down over the dunes of snow that went on forever in every direction. As we came close to a building that was tucked into the side of one of the dunes, a garage door opened spilling light onto the white ground. The driver pulled into the doorway and the door closed behind us.</p>
   <p>Vanish was rushed off on a stretcher and we were shown into a sitting room.</p>
   <p>A strange rush came over us as we all sat uncomfortably. Ronnie sat next to me, having trouble keeping his eyes open. He let his head fall back on the couch. I felt his irregular breaths turn into a more steady rhythm as he leaned against me on the small couch.</p>
   <p>Sam walked into the room and clapped his hands together, "Here in a minute we are going to begin debriefing you all. I’m sure you have a lot of questions, but I am obligated to not answer any of them until after the debriefing has finished.” he explained. We all wanted answers, but we were tired from what had gone down and tired of getting pulled around.</p>
   <p>“Grace, do you want to go first?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, why not.” I stood and followed him out of the room.</p>
   <p>Sam showed me out into the hallway and to a room labeled “Debriefing.” He opened the door to a small room with a bay window the size of the outer wall.</p>
   <p>There were two chairs looking out of a bay window, "Have a seat.” Sam said pointing to one of the chairs.</p>
   <p>A fire burned in a fire place on the wall opposite side of the room.</p>
   <p>I sat down.</p>
   <p>“So I will make this as quick as possible.” He picked up a tablet computer that was resting in his chair and began to fill in some information, "So how long were you inside of the Aurora facility?”</p>
   <p>“We checked the date a few hours after our escape. Best we can tell we were there for around thirty or so days.” I rubbed my face feeling a head ache coming on, "Events shortly after we were taken is a little fuzzy. It’s all a little fuzzy.”</p>
   <p>“What is your ability?” He wasn’t typing, but allowing the computer to do the typing.</p>
   <p>I wasn’t sure how to describe the ability so I just held out my hand and snapped my fingers making a flame about the size of a lighter’s flame hovered over my skin.</p>
   <p>“PyroKinetics, we have only found one other with that ability.” Sam said, "And were you the person that caused the explosion at the facility?”</p>
   <p>“I was the explosion.” I shifted in my seat and let the flame die.</p>
   <p>“Alright, well I think that is about all I need for now.” he looked over the computer screen.</p>
   <p>“What was it that you were calling each other?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“We have call-signs, if the public were to overhear us speaking for any reason, they will only have our nicknames. One of our founders came up with the idea from old comic books and it stuck.” Sam put the computer on the floor next to his chair.</p>
   <p>“Why did you get upset when Hothead said Liz’s name once we reappeared?”</p>
   <p>“It is a layer of defense we use. They have to follow the rules regardless of present company. Every person has to be cleared.”</p>
   <p>“That word you used mod? What does that mean?” I wanted to understand this new world that I had become a part of.</p>
   <p>“It’s short for modification. That is what we refer to someone who was modified from their original DNA makeup in order to gain any number of abilities. Nat’s, or naturals, are people who gain their abilities naturally, and Reg’s are normal people.” he scratched his head, "You’ll learn as you go along.”</p>
   <p>“You recorded the Tier six spike at Las Vegas, how did you know we had gone to the orphanage?”</p>
   <p>“Shortly after the spike, we were contacted by a shadow agent, someone we’ve smuggled within Aurora, that there were new recruits. We started scanning for unregistered users, when Ronnie performed his first attack we honed in and Vanish took us there.” He explained like it was standard daily activity.</p>
   <p>“My head is killing me.” I rubbed my eyes that began to burn from the stress.</p>

    <p>Chapter 9: Eastcroft</p>
   </title>
   <p>Sam and I returned to the waiting room. He took Kenny next. I assured him that there was nothing to worry about and that I would watch after Sandy while he was gone.</p>
   <p>I sat down next to Ronnie who was fast asleep crumpled over to one side. His eyes were racing around behind his closed eyelids.</p>
   <p>I pushed him up and took my seat back. He didn’t wake at all.</p>
   <p>Rachel sat down in the chair next to me.</p>
   <p>“So, who are these people?” she tucked her feet underneath her on the chair for warmth.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. But things here seem much more copasetic.” I rubbed my eyes. I was feeling very tired myself.</p>
   <p>Silence walked into the room. He looked underamazed by what was happening. He grabbed another chair and drug it to where we sat and joined our conversation. He wore all black clothes and his face was wrapped to just below his eyes with a black cloth. When he sat down he took off the face wrap.</p>
   <p>“How are you guys doing?” He had a long scar on the left side of his neck that went up behind his ear and into his short messy black hair.</p>
   <p>“I’m fine; I think Ronnie should see a doctor or something though. He was hit really hard. I’m surprised he got back up and started walking around.”</p>
   <p>“He will get looked over just before his debriefing. Unfortunately the medical staff are all tied up with Vanish right now.”</p>
   <p>“Is she going to be alright?” Rachel asked.</p>
   <p>“I think so, Hothead is torn up, it’s been a long time since we have seen an overuse. Truth be told it’s been six months or so since we have been on a mission. When we got the message from Zach, we jumped on the chance for new recruits.”</p>
   <p>I shook my head, my mouth hanging open, it was like he was speaking another language altogether. I kept looking at the scar on his neck and wondered if that could have been one of us if Rachel hadn’t been there to stop the bullets.</p>
   <p>“Awesome force field by the way.” I turned to look at her.</p>
   <p>“Thanks. I was kind of surprised myself that I was able to do it. I had only done it once before.”</p>
   <p>“We have found that in times of dire need one’s abilities tend to work better. Not to say that someone who spends time learning to control their ability can’t do better.” Silence explained.</p>
   <p>“Where do we go from here?”</p>
   <p>“After Sam finishes all of the interviews he will gather you all together and kind of explain things to you, like some of the rules. He won’t be able to get them all and you will have a lot of questions I’m sure, but we will do our best to teach you as things come up.”</p>
   <p>“Is this what you went through when you came here?” Rachel asked.</p>
   <p>“Sort of, but I was only six when I arrived.” he counted on his fingers as if coming to this place would have been forgettable.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” I wanted to know everything that I could, everything that he would tell me. I wanted to know if his story was like ours.</p>
   <p>“My parents were fleeing from another branch of Aurora. We were all naturals and my father was informed that we were wanted for study. We got cornered in a small town in northern California. My father took on twenty sabers, and two Mods. Unfortunately, he was killed and my mother as well. He was just not powerful enough. The Mod tried to kill me. He was a telekinetic and he bombarded me with debris from the building that my father and the Sabers had torn to pieces.” He stopped for a moment, remembering.</p>
   <p>“He would have succeeded if not for Acumen and Fade. Acumen is Sam’s code name. Fade is another teleporter, but she has been gone for some time now. I don’t think you’ll meet her. They killed the Mod and brought me here. Fade raised me until she left.”</p>
   <p>“Why did she leave?” I sat on the edge of my seat hanging on every word.</p>
   <p>“No one knows. It was about a year ago, she was just gone one night.” He looked devastated.</p>
   <p>Sam returned with Kenny and swapped him for Rachel. Before long he had brought her back and with the help of a male nurse, carried Ronnie out of the room.</p>
   <p>“He seems nice enough.” He sat with Sandy, who would be next.</p>
   <p>“Acumen is like a father to a lot of us.” Silence smiled.</p>
   <p>We all sat quietly and waited for the next step. Ronnie looked like a million bucks when he came back and Sam brought a shirt for Rachel to change into, hers being covered in blood.</p>
   <p>Sandy didn’t take long. Lastly Sam took the twins together.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>Sam came back to the room after a short while; the twins however didn’t return.</p>
   <p>“Where are Mike and Mary?” Rachel demanded.</p>
   <p>“They are on a flight to New York City. There is a family there that wanted to adopt a child and they were ecstatic to be able to adopt twins.” Sam looked sorry, but confident.</p>
   <p>“Wait, you just sent them away?” I protested.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry; they will be taken care of. If we hadn’t sent them now it would have been just that much longer before we can leave for a warmer climate.”</p>
   <p>“But we didn’t even get to say goodbye.” Rachel was very upset.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry Rachel, this is not goodbye. They are in good hands and you will see them again. I promise.” He stopped and took a breath.</p>
   <p>“But!” Rachel pleaded.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. I am very sorry that it had to be this way. I promise that you will see them again, soon.” he looked genuinely sorry.</p>
   <p>Sam paced, gathering his thoughts for a few moments.</p>
   <p>“Care to explain what’s going on?” I started.</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath. "Well, let me start by saying that it’s nice to meet all of you. We call ourselves <emphasis>The Last Line</emphasis>. As far back as the Salem Witch Trials we have been here to protect users from humans and humans from users in one form or another.”</p>
   <p>“Are you with the government or what?” Kenny, the ever paranoid, asked.</p>
   <p>“No, we are affiliated with the government and we do get some funding from them, but otherwise no. We found that with the government, no matter how hard they try, there always seems to be a few corrupted politicians. After a few incidents where they tried to use us as an end to their means, we decided that it would not have a place in our organization.”</p>
   <p>“We work together trying to make the world a safer place for people like us. Look, I’ll be honest with you; we have never rescued more than two people at one time. We are not really prepared. We didn’t get a whole lot of notice from Zach.”</p>
   <p>“What is going to happen to us?” Rachel asked.</p>
   <p>“We have a complex in North America where we have set up a small community. There we will train you to properly control your abilities and meld into a social environment. We also think that education is very important so we will make sure that you have a strong foundation. We will also provide you with pathways to pursue higher education.” Sam explained.</p>
   <p>“Sounds great.” I wasn’t really excited but I wanted to get some sleep that wasn’t medicinally induced.</p>
   <p>“When can we get a meal?” Ronnie rubbed his stomach.</p>
   <p>“There are a couple cooks working right now.”</p>
   <p>“Well, alright then.” Ronnie sat down.</p>
   <p>“We aren’t staying here in Alaska?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh no, no it’s far too cold here.” Sam acted like he was shivering.</p>
   <p>“Good to hear.” Sandy said.</p>
   <p>Sam’s phone chirped. He took it from his pocket and looked at the screen. "The food is ready. So let’s go get something to eat.” he motioning for us to follow him.</p>
   <p>I didn’t know how to react to what was happening. These people went from soldiers to normal people in the blink of an eye. Like someone had flipped a switch.</p>
   <p>The dining room wasn’t big; one long table ran down the center. The five of us, Sam, and Silence all took a tray and filled them with the different foods that the cooks prepared. We had a Thanksgiving Day feast on each of our plates.</p>
   <p>For the first few minutes everyone just ate. Silence finally broke the silence, "You’ll like Eastcroft, it’s a good place to live.”</p>
   <p>“Where is it?” I asked between bites.</p>
   <p>“It’s in the mountains of Colorado. Twenty years ago the town was built as support for an observatory. We found that it was a great spot for us to set up shop.” Sam explained.</p>
   <p>“How many people live there?” Ronnie asked.</p>
   <p>“A few hundred; it’s about a three hour drive to any large city. Most of the people that live in Eastcroft work for us, or run one of the shops in the town, or teach in the school.” Sam explained.</p>
   <p>“When are we going to leave?” Ronnie asked mouth full of mashed potatoes.</p>
   <p>“In the morning.”</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I never wanted to fly in a small one engine plane again. It was the most terrifying experience in my life. Every little bit of chop made me dig my fingernails into Ronnie’s leg and then he would hiss in pain.</p>
   <p>“Sorry.”</p>
   <p>“Its alright.” he grunted through clenched teeth.</p>
   <p>The plane was so small we could only fit five people besides the pilot in the thing. Rachel had to catch the next flight which I could look out the window and see it bobbing around behind us.</p>
   <p>We passed over miles of towns, mountains, and fields. The fifteen hour flight seemed like it took far longer. We had to land twice to fuel.</p>
   <p>“There it is.” Sam pointed to the left side of the plane to a crescent shaped mountain formation.</p>
   <p>The first thing that I could see was the observatory. It sat on top of the mountain and we had to look up out of the windows to see it. The landing on top of the mountain was very rundown. One of the two large satellite dishes had collapsed and damaged one of the two buildings that rested on the landing.</p>
   <p>The town itself was small and tucked back into the base of the mountain itself. Outside of the edge of the mountain was a small airport, or dirt strip anyway, that had zero traffic. There was one road leading out of the town, and I would barely call it a paved road. It merged into a better two lane road that curved back around to the other side of the mountain.</p>
   <p>Trees were thick in all directions and there was a small lake centered in the woods on the opposite side of the mountain.</p>
   <p>The whole place almost looked man made.</p>
   <p>“What is so special about this place?” Ronnie asked.</p>
   <p>“Well besides being for sale when we were looking and very cheap. The mountains are perfect for a device that is designed to mask Kinetic brain waves from Aurora tracking systems.” Sam grinned with pride at the sight of the rundown town.</p>
   <p>The pilot swung the plane around and lined us up with the runway for a landing, "Eastcroft, this is LL01 requesting clearance for landing.” the pilot said into his radio.</p>
   <p>He pushed on the steering wheel forcing the nose of the plane down and I couldn’t help but dig my nails in more as the plane thrashed around in the wind.</p>
   <p>“First thing we are going to do is get your nails cut.” Ronnie grabbed the back of his leg.</p>
   <p>I couldn’t ease up at all.</p>
   <p>The wheels touched down and rocked violently on the uneven ground beneath us, "I’m so sorry Ronnie.” I pried my fingers from his flesh.</p>

    <p>Chapter 10: ATN</p>
   </title>
   <p>“I hope you guys are ready for this.” Sam opened his door and climbed out of the passenger seat.</p>
   <p>The pilot remained.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what I’m ready for anymore.” I followed Ronnie out, Kenny and Sandy following behind me.</p>
   <p>We left the hanger through a long hallway that led to a door built into the rock. The door exited out onto a street, where an SUV sat parked on the shoulder. The sun was falling behind the mountains making it hard to tell what the time was.</p>
   <p>We all crammed into the SUV. Silence and Hothead helped Vanish into another small car before speeding off into town without a word.</p>
   <p>“Where are we going? I would love to get a shower.” Sandy said from the backseat.        "We have had people working all day to prepare a house for the bunch of you to move into and it’s ready so we are going there right away.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>We drove down an outer road that was hardly paved. It went around the far outreaches of the small town right up against the base of the mountain range. He pulled into the driveway of a two story house with large windows on the second floor and on either side of the front door. The rest of the house lacked windows altogether.</p>
   <p>“Why are there no windows on the rest of the house?” Sandy took the words right out of my mouth.</p>
   <p>“The sun never hits those parts of the house. There are three bedrooms, so there will be sharing. There is a full kitchen and two full bathrooms on the first floor. There is a computer and a TV, but the computer is a little old. We are working on getting you some money so you can go out and buy clothes, laptops, whatever you need to feel like home.” Sam put the truck into park and cut the engine.</p>
   <p>We all climbed out of the truck and went inside. It was medically sterilized and the furniture looked like it had never been used.</p>
   <p>I went up the stairs. There was a landing with five huge bay windows and three doors. Ronnie, Kenny, and Sandy all climbed up a second set of stairs on the other side of the landing. They all looked happy, something I hadn’t seen, ever.</p>
   <p>“Who gets their own room?” Kenny asked.</p>
   <p>“We share.” Ronnie smacked Kenny on the back of the head.</p>
   <p>“Sandy? Rachel?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“You take it Grace.” Sandy said.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I’m good to share.” Rachel walked into the middle room followed by Sandy.</p>
   <p>I walked into the last room with the feeling that no one wanted to be too close to me, just in case. The room wasn’t small; two beds could comfortably fit and have plenty of room for other furniture. The bed was pushed up against the back wall and the dresser was placed at the end of the bed. There were no windows. A thick blanket was folded on the bed and two pillows were stacked behind it against the headboard.</p>
   <p>I sat down on the bed and folded my hands in my lap. I looked around the room. I was supposed to call this home now. My home before was not the greatest, but I knew it as a norm. I had no idea anymore what a normal life was or if I would ever have one again.</p>
   <p>I looked up to see Ronnie standing in the door way.</p>
   <p>“Hey.” He said when he saw me look.</p>
   <p>“Hi.” I said quietly.</p>
   <p>“What do you think?” he walked into the room. He leaned against the wall next to the bed.</p>
   <p>“I think that we have a chance to be normal.” I said, “Whatever that may be.”</p>
   <p>“I think that our current situation puts us just about as far from normal as you can get. I think that we need to be careful.” He looked at the back of his hand.</p>
   <p>“Think about it Ronnie. Yeah we’re different now, but everyone around us is different too, we can take this chance to fit in, and maybe stop acting so, well for lack of a better word, different. In being different we are now just a new group of students, kids, people to join this community.”</p>
   <p>“I see. That’s an interesting way of looking at it and you know what? I like it.”</p>
   <p>We left the room and went down stairs. Sam was in the kitchen with his head in the fridge. He heard us walk into the room so he closed the door and turned around.</p>
   <p>“I have gathered some clothes for all of you. It’s nothing too stylish but it’ll have to do until we have a chance to go into the city.” He pointed to the couch where some bags were piled.</p>
   <p>“Well, I call first shower.” I grabbed the bag marked Grace. The two bathrooms were at the back of the house.</p>
   <p>Inside the bathroom, the smell of cleaner filled my nose and bright white tile blinded me. I looked into the mirror and traced my face with my eyes. I held out my hands and I tried to use my abilities. I closed my eyes and tried to go back to that desert that I had seen back at the Aurora facility. I tried to force fire out of my hands but nothing happened.</p>
   <p>I got frustrated and let my arms fall to my side. I figured that with some practice that I should be able to use my abilities again, but if I couldn’t I wondered if Sam would make me leave? I started the water and got into the shower letting the water flow over my body, washing the filth away.</p>
   <p>He wasn’t lying about the clothes not being stylish. There was a pair of loose fit jeans, and a white shirt along with a fresh set of underwear. I’m not the most fashionable person around, but come on.</p>
   <p>I picked the hoodie up off the ground and sniffed it hoping that I would still be able to wear it, but I was wrong. I gathered up all of the clothes off the floor, and decided that I should just go ahead and have them burnt.</p>
   <p>I left the bathroom clean, and Sandy shot right in after me. Kenny looked pissed that he was beaten to the door. I suspected that he let her win though. It was weird to see them like that, like nothing ever happened.</p>
   <p>“Feel better?” Sam sat in an oversized recliner in the living room.</p>
   <p>“Much.” I said, “Is there anything to eat?” I rubbed my stomach.</p>
   <p>“There is some food in the kitchen. I have to leave soon, but I wanted to hang out until you got done in the shower. A few things that I wanted to let you know about; I will be a guardian for all of you, but I won’t live here. I live three houses down. I will be checking up on you occasionally. I’m also there if any of you need anything. We consider you adults until you prove otherwise.”</p>
   <p>“Sounds good to me.”</p>
   <p>The cabinets were full of instant foods and nothing really hit the spot, but I picked something anyway. I made myself some noodles with chicken flavoring.</p>
   <p>I went up to my bedroom and laid out the blanket. I got into bed and tried to find a comfortable spot, but the bed was stiff and unused.</p>
   <p>I looked up to the doorway, "That’s going to get creepy.” I said to Ronnie who was standing in the door arms crossed.</p>
   <p>He was clean now.</p>
   <p>“I don’t mean it to be creepy. I just worry.”</p>
   <p>“I worry too, but I don’t sneak up on people.”</p>
   <p>He smiled and leaned on the doorway, “How are you feeling?”</p>
   <p>“Are you having any trouble using your abilities?” I sat up on the bed.</p>
   <p>He held out his hands and a bolt of energy arched across his palms, "nope it’s actually getting easier the more I use them.”</p>
   <p>“Oh.” I looked at my hands. I concentrated on nothing else and thought only about the fire, but still nothing happened.</p>
   <p>“Maybe we can ask Sam.” He said, “I’m sure he’ll know what’s going on.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” I thought for a moment, “Can we keep this between us for now?”</p>
   <p>He nodded as he walked away. He closed the door making sure that it clicked.</p>
   <p>Sleep came surprisingly slowly that night with all that had been going on the past few days. My body was hot, uncomfortable, but I wasn’t sweating at all. There were a lot of new noises, and the heat was out of control in the room. I kicked the blanket off in the middle of the night. Somehow one of the pillows ended up by the door.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>The next morning Sam was waiting in the kitchen with a buffet of breakfast foods waiting, cooked to perfection.</p>
   <p>“Can we expect this every morning?” Kenny loaded his plate down with some of everything on the table. We all did just as he did, mounding food onto our plates.</p>
   <p>“Are we going to get fat eating like this?” Sandy asked.</p>
   <p>“No, your body will burn all of this off by midday. And unfortunately Kenny, I will not be able to cook like this on a regular basis. I just wanted you all to have a good start to your first day.” He had a much, much smaller plate of food in front of him.</p>
   <p>“What are we going to do today?” I took a bite of toast.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to show you around Eastcroft. Then I’ll take you down to the server and get you guys into the system. You’ll need to think about what you’d like for your codenames. You won’t need them today, but I want you to think about it over the next few days. You will need it before you go on your first mission.” Sam explained.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean by ‘in the system’?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“We have a system implemented to track anyone who uses different abilities or oppose us in any way.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>Sam took us on the promised tour of the small town. He showed us the location of the school, the clinic, and a small corner store. We also passed an unused police station and a larger group of abandoned buildings.</p>
   <p>“What’s with all of the abandoned buildings?” I asked when we passed the fourth building.</p>
   <p>“When the company that owned the town put it up for sale they cleared out in a hurry. Most of these buildings are still full of equipment and we haven’t had time to clear them out yet.” Sam pulled into the parking lot of a small building that was set apart by the huge satellite dish on the roof.</p>
   <p>“What is this place?” Ronnie asked.</p>
   <p>“This is a server for the UATN, Users with Ability Tracking Network. It’s one of six across the country. The dish repeats up to that network station at the top of the mountain next to the observatory.” he pointed to the top of the mountain, "and is accessible from anywhere in the world with the right set of access codes.”</p>
   <p>“Will we have access?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes, we will give you everything you need to use the network.”</p>
   <p>We walked inside of the building. It reminded me of when I went with Ronnie to get his driver’s license. The chairs were very uncomfortable as we waited for an old white haired woman to call our names. She made me think of the old woman from the orphanage.</p>
   <p>My name was called last. I walked up to the window where the woman immediately snapped my photo without any warning.</p>
   <p>“Wow, how about some notice next time.” I rubbed my eyes, irritated, trying to blink the spots away.</p>
   <p>She looked like I had personally ruined her day. She asked me the standard questions like my age, height, weight, so on and so forth. She asked me about my abilities.</p>
   <p>What are my abilities?</p>
   <p>How quickly did they show?</p>
   <p>How hard was it for me to use them?</p>
   <p>What color were the chemicals that they used on me?</p>
   <p>How was the chemical given to me?</p>
   <p>It was all a little overwhelming.</p>
   <p>I went ahead and told her what happened at the Aurora facility. I left out my new found lack of abilities though.</p>
   <p>When she let me leave I met everyone outside in the parking lot. The lobby was small so I couldn’t blame them for wanting to get out into the open air.</p>
   <p>“Tomorrow we will go out to the field and you will work with Silence. He is very good at helping people learn to use their abilities properly. You are all still very unrefined, but you’ll gain control, before long you will be masters.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>He took us back to the house.</p>
   <p>“When do we start school?” Ronnie asked when we got back inside and made ourselves comfortable in the living room.</p>
   <p>“We will get all of that sorted out in the next couple of days. For now just make yourselves at home and relax.” Sam stayed for a few moments, but he had other pressing matter so he left us alone to catch up on television.</p>
   <p>Ronnie found a news station. The words <emphasis>Aurora Corporation </emphasis>caught our eyes. We all sat in silence and watched the reporter.</p>
   <p>“A short while ago we saw firsthand that The Aurora Corporation was not invincible when one of their experimental power reactors went critical in the wee hours of morning. Despite this small set back their latest project has not been slowed in the slightest. With NASA being completely dismantled after an incident last year, Aurora has stepped up to take the task of dismantling and transporting the ISS from orbit to a museum in Nevada. The Aurora Corporation has been constructing a replacement space station that will be operated in cooperation with the leading governments around the world.” The scene cut away from the reporter to photos of a computer generated model of the future space station.</p>
   <p>“Oh that’s what we need.” Ronnie shut off the TV and threw the remote a little harder then he should have on the coffee table. The batteries went flying across the room.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 11: Block</p>
   </title>
   <p>The heat was horrible but it seemed like it was affecting everyone else more than me. I usually didn’t spend a lot of time outside, none of us did. Sam was kind enough to unload a couple of coolers full of water onto the field before he drove off to attend to his business.</p>
   <p>Silence came out of a tent that had been set up towards the back of the field. A satellite dish was planted in the ground next to the tent. He was wearing the same thick clothes that he wore when they rescued us from Jolt and his Sabers, but he already had sweat dripping from his face. He took his shirt off and threw it on a nearby chair.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know if I’m going to be able to concentrate.” Rachel bit her lower lip. I nodded, but kept hidden from Ronnie. Silence was lean, not an ounce of excess fat on his body.</p>
   <p>“Alright, we are going to start today with what we call showing. I know all of you were forced to show by Aurora, but using your abilities naturally without the assistance of their machines can make a world of difference.” Silence explained.</p>
   <p>“What is your ability exactly?” Ronnie asked with aggravation in his voice.</p>
   <p>“I’m fast, agile, and above all silent. I can phase as I move to jump over pockets of space.”</p>
   <p>Ronnie turned and looked at Kenny, they both chuckled. When they turned back, Silence was gone. Ronnie looked in all directions very quickly, but in a split second Silence had Ronnie’s arm twisted around his back.</p>
   <p>Ronnie tried to fight back, but Silence had his arm held behind his back too well, "Alright, I give.”</p>
   <p>Silence let him go.</p>
   <p>“Above all, you must concentrate. It is important for you to focus your abilities into something that you can use. Never underestimate your opponent.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s get started already.” Rachel said.</p>
   <p>Silence pulled a remote out of his pocket, shaking his head, "Two hundred yards away there are several targets set up and they are set on automatic mechanisms and timers. Break up and attack them as the target dummies appear.”</p>
   <p>We all walked off in different directions. I could see Ronnie in my peripheral vision. I kept my eye on him wondering what I was going to do. A target shot up in front of Ronnie; it was shaped like a masked soldier. He hesitated at first, but quickly shot a bolt of lightning into the targets chest sending splinters of wood flying in all directions.</p>
   <p>“Very good Ronnie.” Silence yelled from the tent where he was recording everything.</p>
   <p>“Thanks.” Ronnie spat towards the tent.</p>
   <p>“Visualize what you want to happen. Anything is possible.” Silence announced to us all.</p>
   <p>I closed my eyes and held out my hands. I visualized fire between my hands just like Silence said, but when I opened my eyes there was nothing. I got mad, furious, and started to fume. I clenched my fists so tight that my knuckles turned white.</p>
   <p>Still nothing happened.</p>
   <p>“What’s wrong Grace?” Silence walked over to where I stood struggling, "That soldier would have killed you already.”</p>
   <p>“Oh, it’s nothing.” I looked away. I waited for my face to cool before looking back to him, "I’m just having some trouble.”</p>
   <p>“Really, What kind of trouble?” he asked, his tone turned concerned in a heartbeat.</p>
   <p>“It’s nothing.” I wished he would just drop it and move on.</p>
   <p>“Your abilities are directly connected to your mental well being. How long has it been since you used your abilities?” he demanded.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, since we escaped.” I turned away from him and took a few steps in the other direction.</p>
   <p>He grabbed my arm and turned me to look at him, "Grace this is important, we need to get you checked out.” he pleaded. I wrenched my arm out of his hand but I didn’t know why I was all of a sudden so defensive. I realized quickly that I had overreacted.</p>
   <p>Ronnie saw what was going on and rushed over to where Silence and I stood. He stepped between the two of us.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. Did I hurt you Grace?” Silence looked at his still outstretched hand.</p>
   <p>“No, no.” I said, "It’s just with everything, I’m just a little jumpy.”</p>
   <p>“None the less, I need to call Sam. You need to see the doctors.”</p>
   <p>“Is that really necessary, maybe she just needs to have a few days to find her abilities again or something?” Ronnie backed me up.</p>
   <p>“No, Ronnie I think he is right.” I gently pushed him to the side. He didn’t fight me on the subject, but looked disappointed.</p>
   <p>“So much for keeping it under wraps.” he turned and walked away.</p>
   <p>Silence returned to the tent picking up his shirt on the way. I felt that it was only a matter of time before they declared me normal and sent me packing.</p>
   <p>I stood by the door chewing on my thumb nail. I tried to hear what was being said but Silence was very good at keeping his voice down.</p>
   <p>He pressed a button on the screen of his phone and put it back in his pocket, "Sam will be up here to get you shortly. He would like the rest of you to continue to practice with your abilities.”</p>
   <p>I opened the cooler that Sam had unloaded from his SUV and took a bottle of water. Everyone followed my lead. Silence instructed everyone to return to practice. I sat down in a canvas folding chair and rested my head on my fist. I was so mad that my abilities weren’t working.</p>
   <p>Sandy was holding back from the rest. She hadn’t done anything to attack any of the targets, "Sandy, why are you hesitating?” Silence asked.</p>
   <p>“I’m not sure how I would use my ability to attack people.” she scratched her head.</p>
   <p>“Well you possess the ability of metamorphosis, correct?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, how am I supposed to use that?” She said impatiently.</p>
   <p>“I’m sure we can think of something.” he stopped for a minute. "Try turning your hand into a knife or some kind of blunt object or something.”</p>
   <p>Sandy thought for a moment then closed her eyes. It took a few seconds, but her fingers started to close, and then mold together into a point. Her hands began to stretch out and flatten; they changed from flesh to what looked like metal. She opened her eyes surprised at how her arms and hands now looked.</p>
   <p>“Very good.” Silence patted her on the back, "Now, test them out.”</p>
   <p>Sandy ran as fast as she could swinging her arms at the head of a nearby target. She swiped it clean off. She turned back and smiled proud of what she had done.</p>
   <p>“I wonder if I can use electrical power to form different objects.” Ronnie looked at his hands.</p>
   <p>“You’ll never know until you try.” Silence smiled.</p>
   <p>Ronnie concentrated, as moments passed nothing happened. He got frustrated and sent a bolt smashing into the closest target.</p>
   <p>“Don’t get angry you may just have to practice. Just keep at it.” Silence laughed.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“How do you feel?” Sam asked. We were heading back to the clinic.</p>
   <p>“I feel fine.” I put emphasis on the word <emphasis>fine</emphasis>.</p>
   <p>“I understand that you feel fine compared to how you were before, but Aurora, they changed your body, and you may not be able to tell if there is something wrong on some of the new levels.” he explained.</p>
   <p>“What if I’m just normal now?” I turned to look out of the window, “What if I, like, used up my abilities? My eyes burned, but I forced my composure.</p>
   <p>“It’s not that easy. I know that you would like for things to return to normal but there is really no turning back now.”</p>
   <p>I smiled, and then flashed with embarrassment and the depression flooded in quickly.</p>
   <p>“What?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“You misunderstand. I don’t want to be normal. I think that being here is a definite plus in my life, in all of ours. We have a chance at fitting in. I don’t want to have to leave.” I explained.</p>
   <p>“Grace,” He paused, "even if your abilities vanished, which I’m sure hasn’t happened, we wouldn’t just send you away.”</p>
   <p>I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
   <p>“It really is magnificent.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>We pulled into the clinic parking lot and parked near the front.</p>
   <p>“We have a small medical staff here; at another facility, we keep more on standby. We have never had a need for a large staff.” Sam said as we got out of the truck. I followed him into the building. We walked right past the waiting room into an exam room.</p>
   <p>“Have a seat.” he motioned to a table. He left me alone in the room and closed the door as he left.</p>
   <p>It was cold, steel.</p>
   <p>It reminded me of being back at Aurora.</p>
   <p>Sam returned with two men in toe, he pointed to a tall man with blond hair that brushed his shoulders and thin lined glasses, "this is Doctor Timothy.”</p>
   <p>“Nice to meet you.” Doctor Timothy spoke in a heavy English accent.</p>
   <p>“And this is Doctor Ziefer.” Sam pointed to the other man who was my height, messy hair, and glasses on the top of his head.</p>
   <p>“You hit level six, right?” he asked extremely excited.</p>
   <p>“Um, yeah.” I leaned back on my hands.</p>
   <p>“You’ll have to forgive Ziefer, he loves his work. He is our expert on Kinetic brainwaves and mental health.” Sam explained.</p>
   <p>“He is your expert on mental health.” I said bewildered.</p>
   <p>“You’ll learn to like him.” Sam left the room to give us privacy.</p>
   <p>“So, Grace, how do you feel?” Dr. Timothy asked.</p>
   <p>“I feel fine. I’m always hungry.”</p>
   <p>“Does your head hurt a lot?” Ziefer asked.</p>
   <p>“Sometimes.” I said, "What was your name?”</p>
   <p>“Ziefer, call me Z though.”</p>
   <p>“Well, let’s do a physical work up, then a mental.” Dr. Timothy said.</p>
   <p>“Sounds good."Dr. Z said. He turned and joined Sam in the small waiting room outside of the exam room.</p>
   <p>Doctor Timothy gave me the same exact exams that I had had the last time I went to the doctors before we had been abducted. I always felt extremely self-conscious but he made it as easy as possible. He was a hundred times more personable than my last doctor; who had acted like a car that was in for a tune up.</p>
   <p>Doctor Timothy left the room with two samples of my blood that he had taken. The room was cold and the table was incredibly uncomfortable. I looked around at the posters on the walls. They were all the normal posters, except one. <emphasis>Mental health is key.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Doctor Timothy returned with a chart in his hands, "Well Grace, everything checks out perfect.”</p>
   <p>“Like I said, I feel fine.”</p>
   <p>“Maybe Doctor Z will be able to help you more.” He shrugged. He left the room again. I was starting to think that they should have installed a revolving door.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z came in and was very difficult to read as a person. He was a short slightly overweight man who was in love with his work. That much I could tell.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to attach a brain wave monitor that we stole from Aurora and modified.” Dr. Z jumped right into the subject without any small talk.</p>
   <p>“Is it going to hurt?” I recalled the Kinetic brain wave inducer.</p>
   <p>“Nope, the modifications that I made make the process completely painless and the device is much more accurate now.”</p>
   <p>He placed a black plastic case on the table. Inside was a device that looked like a crown of the electronic junk king. He put it on my head, and then took out a tablet computer.</p>
   <p>He activated the crown.</p>
   <p>“This tablet will allow me to monitor everything that goes on in there in real time.” he pointed to my head.</p>
   <p>“Alright.” I am at a loss for words.</p>
   <p>He tapped on the screen a few times. "Alright, now try and use your abilities.”</p>
   <p>I closed my eyes and told myself that I wanted to light my hands on fire. I concentrated with everything that I had.</p>
   <p>As with every other time, nothing happened.</p>
   <p>“This is very interesting.” he said.</p>
   <p>“What?” I said.</p>
   <p>“Do you mind if I ask Sam to come in here?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Sure, I guess.”</p>
   <p>He opened the door and motioned for Sam to come into the room.</p>
   <p>“So, what’s going on?” Sam looked from the doctor, to me, then back again.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z pressed a button on the side of a monitor that hung on the wall. He pressed another button on the screen of the tablet. The picture was projected onto the monitor. Green lines on a graph shot all over the place.</p>
   <p>“Explain this Doctor Z, please.” Sam pinched the bridge of his nose.</p>
   <p>“Moving from left to right is the time spent on the machine. Over here on the left is no Kinetic brain activity. Here is where I told you to use your ability.” he pointed to a spot where the green line spiked from top to bottom. "It’s in the level five ranges. But this black area.” he pointed to the area after the spike, "It is something new. So new, as a matter of fact, that the machine cannot read it. That is why it’s just blank.”</p>
   <p>“So what do you think it is?” Sam asked.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z pondered for a few moments chewing on the end of a pen.</p>
   <p>“I think, and my theory is preliminary, that this is a mental block. Until she gets through whatever could be causing it, she may never be able to use her abilities again.” He turned off the monitor.</p>
   <p>“How can I have a mental block?”</p>
   <p>“We have seen that in times of great distress one’s abilities can be empowered, but we have never really dealt with someone that has had a distress caused by one’s own abilities.” Doctor Z said, “You can see that your brain waves do spike, but something stops the result from forming. I could be wrong but it would be the first time.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 12: Observatory</p>
   </title>
   <p>Dr. Z wanted to look over the test results more so Sam took me back to the house.</p>
   <p>“Do you think it’s because I reached level six?”</p>
   <p>“I can’t pretend to know, but that could have something to do with it. I have only met one other person that had reached that level of power. His mind was stressed but for other reasons. He also had natural abilities not modifications like yours.”</p>
   <p>“I wonder if it has to do with the people I killed when I destroyed the Aurora facility. I found out afterward from a report on the radio.” I looked out of the window. I didn’t like thinking about what the reporter said, but the memory didn’t cause any significant pain.</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about it. I’m sure that we can work through what is going on.” He pulled into the driveway and stopped the truck for me to get out.</p>
   <p>“Are the others back?”</p>
   <p>“No, not yet. They should be back soon. If you need anything hit one on the speed dial, the phone is by the fridge.”</p>
   <p>I got out of the truck and walked to the front door. I placed my hand on the pad next to the door. It clicked and I pushed it open. The lights came on automatically brightening the room.</p>
   <p>In the kitchen I found something to eat, cooked it, and sat down on the couch in the living room, alone to enjoy the quiet.</p>
   <p>I turned on the TV. It was tuned onto a news channel but there was nothing of interest, so I changed it to a music channel, and dug into my food trying not to spill anything on the clean furniture.</p>
   <p>After a few music videos, the front door opened and the others filed into the house. They were so loud that I could not hear myself think. They attacked the kitchen like a herd of wild animals leaving nothing but disaster in their wake.</p>
   <p>Ronnie came into the living room and sat down next to me, "So, what is the diagnosis?” He turned the channel on the TV without even asking if I was watching.</p>
   <p>“Apparently what is going on in my head is something that they have never seen before.” I picked up my empty bowl up off the table.</p>
   <p>“And what’s that?” He stopped me.</p>
   <p>“They seem to think that it is some kind of mental block.” I said simply. I wasn’t really in the mood to talk about what had happened at the clinic.</p>
   <p>Everyone piled into the living room and started to flip through the channels, so I decided that it was time for me to relinquish the room. I took my dishes to the kitchen, cleaned them, and then I went up to my bedroom.</p>
   <p>I sat down on the bed. I was so bored and I didn’t want to just watch TV. Someone knocked on my doorway.</p>
   <p>It was Rachel.</p>
   <p>“How do you feel?”</p>
   <p>“I’m tired and bored.”</p>
   <p>“Do you want to talk?” she seemed very concerned.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry, but I’d rather not right now.”</p>
   <p>“Alright, let me know if there is anything that I can get for you.” She left letting the door shut as she walked away.</p>
   <p>I felt alone and I didn’t know who I wanted to talk to about it. I felt like I used to feel before we had been abducted. No one at the orphanage could relate because they all had groups that they could belong to and I was alone.</p>
   <p>And now I was right back in that situation.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>I listened for everyone to go to bed. I heard Ronnie stand outside of my door for a few moments, but I’m sure Rachel told everyone that I didn’t want to talk. After a few seconds he left. I heard his hand slide off my door as he walked away.</p>
   <p>I got up and left my room. After a quick stop off at the bathroom I left the house. It was dark out, the roads were empty, and I decided to just wander around the town. Walking through the downtown area, I just got the feeling that the place was so cookie cutter. The buildings were all built out of the same material; same basic shapes went into the design.</p>
   <p>I knew, however, that I could eventually call this place home.</p>
   <p>I made my way over to a building that extruded from the base of the tallest mountain. There was a sign that said <emphasis>Eastcroft Observatory. </emphasis>There were no lights on in the windows, and the doors were locked.</p>
   <p>I wondered if they still used the telescopes or if they just used the satellite dish. I turned to walk away from the building but was startled by Silence standing behind me. I refrained from screaming but pushed him, "You jerk.”</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry.” He said taking a step back.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” I tucked my hands into my jean pockets.</p>
   <p>“I have night watch and I spotted you leaving your house.” he held out a jacket.</p>
   <p>“So you thought you would follow me and catch me helpless.” I took the jacket and put it on.</p>
   <p>“No, I was going to talk to you, but I wasn’t sure if you were still upset with me from what happened this morning.”</p>
   <p>“No, I’m not upset.” I started to walk back towards town, "I’m extremely frustrated.”</p>
   <p>“Are you interested in the observatory?” he remained planted in front of the doors where he had startled me.</p>
   <p>“I was just wondering if it’s still being used.” I looked up at the mountain.</p>
   <p>“Not since Fade left. She was the only one that cared about it. Well I did but I don’t know anything about space observing.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know if it uses a reflecting telescope?” I had had an interest in astronomy for a while a few years back.</p>
   <p>“It uses the kind you can look into the sky with.” he grinned from ear to ear.</p>
   <p>“Point taken.” I turned again to walk away but he stopped me.</p>
   <p>“Do you want to go up and take a look?”</p>
   <p>I stood there for a moment thinking about going up to the top of a mountain. I did want to see what the town looked like from up there.</p>
   <p>“Well?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. How long does it take to get to the top?”</p>
   <p>“About seven minutes.”</p>
   <p>“Are we allowed?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, we just have to be careful.”</p>
   <p>He used a key to unlock the door and held it for me, smiling.</p>
   <p>“Alright.” I walked into the building.</p>
   <p>We walked through the dark lobby, old florescent lights lit up as we walked through the room but most were blown. There was dust everywhere and the computers on the receptions desk looked at least ten years old. There was a bank of four elevators at the end of a hall.</p>
   <p>Silence pressed the button on the wall between the doors. A set of doors opened and he stepped in holding the door open for me again. This elevator car was a little different than any I had seen before. Instead of just an open room there were seats around the walls that had harnesses mounted to the back of them.</p>
   <p>“How do we get up so fast?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know how it works.” He said honestly.</p>
   <p>I sat down, and Silence did the same. We both strapped the harnesses across our shoulders. He pressed the red button on the armrest of his seat.</p>
   <p>I felt a humming in the floor, and all of a sudden the elevator rocketed upward.</p>
   <p>“How fast are we going?”</p>
   <p>“Around nineteen, twenty miles per hour.”</p>
   <p>“It seems much faster than that.” The car shook like the plane had every time we had hit turbulence.</p>
   <p>“It’s fast enough.”</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>The landing at the top of the mountain was in pretty rough shape. The damage that I had seen from the plane was nothing compared to up close view of the dilapidated buildings. There were two communication dishes, one of which was embedded in the ground below where it had once stood.</p>
   <p>“What happened up here?”</p>
   <p>“Not sure it was like this when I got here and they have never put any money into fixing the place. Plus Sam doesn’t want the repair to bring us any undue attention.” he showed me through to the observation deck.</p>
   <p>There were at least twenty computers in the room. All of which were lined up so that one person could wheel to them all.</p>
   <p>He took me out to the telescopes. There were six of them perfectly lined up in two rows of three. We walked into one of the domes and I checked out the telescope.</p>
   <p>It had about a ninety inch mirror that really needed to be cleaned but the rest of the telescope seemed to be in good condition.</p>
   <p>“What do you think?” Silence asked with his hands in his pockets.</p>
   <p>“I would like to see what these things can see.” I wiped the filth off with my finger measuring about an eighth of an inch thick.</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t know where to start.” he said.</p>
   <p>“Well if all these mirrors are this dirty we won’t be able to, but if Fade kept her images on the computers then I’m sure we could find something.”</p>
   <p>We went back into the control room and I started to boot up the computers. It was a slow process; the computers were older. They had an operating system that I had never seen before and had to assume was custom designed for the observatory.</p>
   <p>“She spent most of her time in front of this computer.” he pointed to the computer with the biggest screen.</p>
   <p>I sat down in front of the station, it booted right up, not asking for any kind of password. The desktop was relatively empty but there was a single icon. I clicked on it opening a program that started with a splash screen. It said <emphasis>Eastcroft Observatory. </emphasis>The Eastcroft had a mark through it, and <emphasis>Fade’s </emphasis>was written next to it.</p>
   <p>“She had a good sense of humor, didn’t she?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” he said face low, "Look Grace I didn’t mean to upset you earlier out on the field.”</p>
   <p>“What?”</p>
   <p>“When I grabbed you, I didn’t mean to hurt you or anything.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about that. I overreacted.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks.”</p>
   <p>I looked into his eyes. The same color eyes that we all had, so blue they were glowing.</p>
   <p>I cleared my throat and looked back to the computer screen. There were a few icons inside of the program, one marked targeting, one marked notes, and one marked imagery along with one marked settings. I clicked on the one marked imagery.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Hard Drive Error: No Files Found</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Well that sucks.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Sorry about that, the computers have been sitting for a long time.” He looked down at his watch. "Crap, we need to get going, the sun’s going to be up soon, and we need to get you home.”</p>
   <p>“Do you mind if I come up here and work on getting the telescopes working?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t mind but you’ll have to ask Sam if he is alright with it.”</p>
   <p>“I thought it was ok if we were up here.” I shut down the computers.</p>
   <p>“Well I may have fibbed a little. Sam prefers that we ask first.”</p>
   <p>“Hmm, that is a good way to start off a relationship.” I got up from the desk chair.</p>
   <p>“I figured it would be a good first date.” He didn’t miss a beat.</p>
   <p>I stammered for a second, "I umm.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about it I’m just joking, Grace” he grinned again.</p>

    <p>Chapter 13: Denver</p>
   </title>
   <p>I slept that morning. I got the best sleep that I had for a very long time. When I woke I was in a great mood. I got out of bed, grabbed a stack of clean clothes, and hit the shower. I didn’t have to fight anyone, they were all out of the house already.</p>
   <p>I walked out of the bathroom putting my hair up when I almost collided with Silence in the kitchen doorway. I took a few steps back and let go of my hair.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
   <p>I walked past him and searched for a clean bowl but there wasn’t one to be found. Every dish in the house was stacked in the sink.</p>
   <p>“Vanish is out at the field with everybody today, all they really need for now is a glorified babysitter.” He joined me next to the sink and dried as I washed.</p>
   <p>“Ok, but why are you here?” I rubbed my stomach as it growled loudly.</p>
   <p>“Sam gave me that for you.” He nodded towards an envelope on the counter.</p>
   <p>I opened it up. It was stuffed full of cash, all of it hundreds.</p>
   <p>“How much is here.” My mouth hung half open; I had never seen that much money at one time before.</p>
   <p>“Ten.” He said.</p>
   <p>“For everyone?”</p>
   <p>“Nope, just for you. It’s to get you started, you know get what you want. It’s a government re-establishment fund that Sam developed. He found some non appropriated money or something, I don’t know.”</p>
   <p>I took a breath and sighed in disbelief. I just looked at the money.</p>
   <p>“Come on I’ll take you into the city.” He smiled</p>
   <p>“What city?”</p>
   <p>“Denver, we usually go around there when we need to go shopping for anything that is not dime store stuff.”</p>
   <p>“What about the others?” I asked my mouth watering; I still had not eaten anything.</p>
   <p>“Sam is going to take them later.”</p>
   <p>“What if I want to go with them?”</p>
   <p>“You can if you want. I figured you’d want some space given your midnight stroll last night.” He seemed kind of hurt that I was considering not going with him.</p>
   <p>I thought for a moment. The money was burning in my hand, and I wanted some clothes from this decade. Things started to jump into my head, like a new laptop, I had never had a new laptop. Just government issued refurbished stuff.</p>
   <p>“Can we stop off and see the others before we leave?”</p>
   <p>“Sure, no problem.” he said, "Are you hungry?”</p>
   <p>“So very hungry!”</p>
   <p>We got into Silence’s car, it was a nice sports car, I had never seen anything like it before in my life, when he turned the key there was no noise. We left the house and headed for the field where the others were practicing.</p>
   <p>I looked over at Silence as he drove, eyes on the road, “Ok, I have to know, what is your real name?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” An over menacing grin stretched across his face, “I wonder if I can trust you?”</p>
   <p>“Can you trust me?” I was outraged at his distrust. “I’m not the one who sneaks up on people in the middle of the night.”</p>
   <p>“Point taken.” He said but went no further.</p>
   <p>“Well?” I prodded.</p>
   <p>“My name is Ryder Alexander. I wouldn’t be surprised if you wanted to continue to call me Silence.”</p>
   <p>“Ryder, huh, I like it. I would have pegged you for a Curtis.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t really like it.” He stopped before he turned into the dirt road that led to the field. When I got out I could see why. His car was so low that it wouldn’t have made it over the curb.</p>
   <p>I could see several explosions, energy blasts, and other things that were signs of the fight going on. We walked down the dirt road, and when the others saw us they stopped what they were doing, and met us at the tent.</p>
   <p>“Hey, Grace.” Ronnie waved.</p>
   <p>“Hey, guys.”</p>
   <p>Vanish looked like death, she had black bags under her eyes, and the look of stress on her face. She leaned on Hothead who didn’t seem to mind.</p>
   <p>“How do you feel today?” Rachel asked.</p>
   <p>“Fine.” I said, “But more importantly how do you feel Vanish?”</p>
   <p>“Oh, don’t worry about me. I feel great now, I know I look like hell, but looks can be deceiving.” Vanish smiled.</p>
   <p>“I was going to take Grace into the city so that she can get do some shopping.” Silence smiled. It seemed like he was specifically trying to get a rise out of Ronnie.</p>
   <p>“Unless you guys would rather me stay here and hang out.” I said. I wanted to go into the city with Silence, I liked hanging out with him, but I didn’t want anyone to think that I was ditching them.</p>
   <p>“You go on ahead.” Kenny patted me on the shoulder, “Don’t worry we’ll be just fine here. When you get better I’ll take you on myself.” He joked.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, I’ll fill you in later on what’s going on.” Ronnie slid Silence a dark look, but he didn’t say anything.</p>
   <p>We said goodbye and left the practice field. The others didn’t take long to get back to blowing stuff up. I could only imagine how much fun it was and what I was missing.</p>
   <p>We got into Silence’s car and headed out of town. The small town was bustling with plenty of activity; it reminded me of the last town that we had lived in, Greencrest. We actually passed a few cars as we drove through the downtown area.</p>
   <p>“What do you think so far?” Silence asked, “I mean I know you haven’t been here that long, but I’m sure that you have some kind of feel.”</p>
   <p>“I really like this place, everyone seems to be nice. I actually feel accepted here.” I kept my attention on the scenery outside of the car.</p>
   <p>A few miles out of town I saw a sign next to a road that wound into the woods back towards the opposite side of the mountain. It read Madison Lake House one mile, and the word Madison took me for a moment. I had heard it before or seen it somewhere. Silence was going on in the background, but I wasn’t listening.</p>
   <p>“So there is a lake too?”</p>
   <p>“Yeah, it belonged to the Madison family.” He glanced back over his shoulder at the small dirt road. It twisted and weaved through a wooded area.</p>
   <p>“The whole lake?” I turned back to the road in front of us.</p>
   <p>“Umm, yeah, they owned the mountain and the observatory as well but they had to sell because some of the funding was revoked for his company. I don’t know much about it.”</p>
   <p>I thought about the name Madison, but after a while I pushed it out of my head, and returned my attention to Silence. He talked about all the things that went on in Eastcroft and some of the things that The Last Line had done in the past.</p>
   <p>We took a short trip over an interstate and then he exited into the city. We arrived around midday, the sun was high, and my stomach was growling. Silence heard it finally.</p>
   <p>“I guess your stomach has decided where we go first. Where would you like to eat?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. Where is good?”</p>
   <p>“I know a little place.” He turned off the main road and got me lost with all of the turns on the back roads.</p>
   <p>We pulled into the parking lot of a small diner that had outdoor seating overlooking a manmade pond. Fountains sprayed in all directions from the center. We got out of the car and walked towards the diner but before we got to the door, he motioned for me to go sit down at one of the outdoor tables.</p>
   <p>“You don’t know what I want to eat.”</p>
   <p>“Trust me.” He walked away without giving me a chance to retaliate.</p>
   <p>I walked over to the table closes to the water. The sun came down just perfect not to get into my eyes, but to give a perfect back drop for the ducks swimming in the water. Silence returned shortly with a couple of baskets of food.</p>
   <p>“I used to come here all the time. I don’t get to come to the city much anymore.” He took a fry and dipped it into his ketchup.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t you come here anymore?” I knew as soon as the words were out what he was going to say.</p>
   <p>“I haven’t been back since Fade disappeared.” He tossed a fry into the water so that the ducks could fight over it.</p>
   <p>The basket of food contained a few Buffalo wings and some fries. I dipped one of the wings in ranch and took a bite, “not bad.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah the food is good but I came for the memories.” He played with a fry.</p>
   <p>He told me a few stories about when he was younger and I had the feeling that he was doing all of the talking, but I really didn’t have anything to talk about. I grew up in a handful of orphanages, end of story. Although that name was bugging me again. I seem to remember it from when I was younger.</p>
   <p>We went to a mall next, things were slow; the halls were empty and so were the shops. It was the middle of the day and most people our age were in class somewhere. We went to several shops. I purchased a wardrobe that was more my taste. We went to a computer store and I got the exact computer that I wanted.</p>
   <p>I asked Silence about a cell phone but he told me not to worry about it, Sam would give us all one. We found a store where I could get an IPod and that is where I decided to quit spending the money. I had already burnt through half of it.</p>
   <p>We put everything into the car and left Denver. The road to Eastcroft was empty. The sun was on its way down by the time we were back on the interstate.</p>
   <p>By the time we got back into town, everyone had long gone to bed. Ryder helped me carry everything up to my bedroom and I felt my face flash red when he got close as he went to leave. He must have noticed it because he smiled but he didn’t say anything.</p>
   <p>I grabbed my new pajamas and went down to the bathroom. I took a shower and sat in the living room trying to watch TV. There wasn’t anything that I wanted to watch, so after a few minutes of mindless cartoons I switched off the TV, and went to bed.</p>
   <p>I wasn’t really tired but I figured I would force myself to sleep so that I wouldn’t waste most of the next day sleeping. Even though I couldn’t use my abilities, I wanted to be out with the others while they trained.</p>

    <p>Chapter 14: Truth</p>
   </title>
   <p>I was able to tag along for combat training whenever I wanted to or I could stay at the house. I really enjoyed just hanging out at the field while everyone got more fluent with their abilities. After everyone mastered taking down the wooden targets, several last line agents volunteered to spare with the others.</p>
   <p>I would hang back as the rest of the group would enter powerful combat with a wide range of combatants. We were introduced to some wild abilities that I couldn’t even understand.</p>
   <p>I walked over and stood next to Ryder, “It looks like everyone is really getting the hang of using their abilities.” An explosion peppered us with dirt and grass.</p>
   <p>“I really wish that we could be working on your abilities.” he smiled.</p>
   <p>“Why are you training everyone in martial arts?” I had seen most of the moves they were now fluently using in one movie or another. I had always thought that the combat in those films was nothing more than expensive choreography and didn’t really translate into actual combat.</p>
   <p>“We use martial arts to teach discipline just as the creators had intended. In fact, some of the styles that we teach were developed by Kinetic users like ourselves.” He took a few steps back, “Why don’t we start your hand to hand training?” He held up his hands.</p>
   <p>I had made excuses up until that point and avoided taking part in the actual lessons, but as far as I knew we were still wanted, dead or alive. Powers or no, I needed some way to defend myself.</p>
   <p>I took a few steps back and copied what he had done with his hands.</p>
   <p>“What do you want me to do?” I looked at my hands trying to recall what I had seen in movies as I was growing up.</p>
   <p>“Whatever you can think of then we’ll go from there.”</p>
   <p>“Be easy, it’s my first time.”</p>
   <p>“Come at me with your best shot.”</p>
   <p>I took a deep breath and tried a surprise round house kick. As fast as I was in a blur he swiped my leg. He used enough force to not only divert the energy of my kick, but also make me lose my balance and stumble. I couldn’t catch myself and fell face first into the grass.</p>
   <p>“Not bad, but… not good either.” He held out his hand to help me up off the ground. I took it and pulled myself up onto my feet.</p>
   <p>“You are so fast!” I brushed off my front.</p>
   <p>“It’s part of my ability.” He said, “When I realized just how much power you had behind that kick I had to move fast or you might have crushed my skull.” He said.</p>
   <p>“You can tell by one kick? I would say that crushing your skull would have been useful in a fight to the death.” I really didn’t think that the kick would have caused any real damage.</p>
   <p>“You have a lot of raw power; your kick would have broken bones. We have determined from your group’s blood tests that they tampered with your DNA in more than one way. Your muscles are much denser and somehow lighter. So much raw power.” He pumped his fist behind his back to dissipate some pain.</p>
   <p>I heard Sam’s truck before I saw it. The thick cloud of dust that always kicked up when someone drove to where the tent was set up was billowed high in the sky. Everyone joined me and Ryder at the tent.</p>
   <p>“What’s with the visit boss?” Ryder asked.</p>
   <p>“I just wanted to have a chat with the new recruits.” He opened up the back of his truck and unloaded a cooler full of drinks. He tossed waters to everyone.</p>
   <p>“Is there something wrong?” I grabbed a chair, and took a seat near the tent.</p>
   <p>“No, everything is as it should be.” He took a deep breath, “Look, I just wanted to talk to you about a difficult topic to get into. Sometimes in our situation,” he paused pondering his words carefully, “There is death and killing ones enemies before they kill you is a necessary evil. The Aurora Corporation, as you have seen, has no reservations about taking the lot of you out of the equation.”</p>
   <p>“So we are supposed to just flip some switch and be soldiers.” Ronnie crossed his arms in determination.</p>
   <p>“I’m not saying that you should just give up on your humanity, but the Sabers for instance are killing machines that are quite literally programmed to kill. You can’t dissuade them, you can’t stop them. Most of the users that Aurora has on their payroll are there for their own reasons. They are highly trained, extremely powerful assassins.” Sam grimaced having to explain this to a group of teenagers.</p>
   <p>“Wonderful.” I sighed and took a swig of my water.</p>
   <p>“However much I hate it, you may have to kill.” he looked down at the ground. “Our goal is to help people like us. We do whatever is necessary to get people out of Aurora’s grip, or at least slow them down. If we can help normal people so be it, but our kind is our priority. I know that that is a simplistic way of looking at things, but we don’t have the resources to look after everyone.”</p>
   <p>Quiet fell as we drank our water. I thought about the first time we had seen Sam and the Last Line. Hothead and Silence had killed the Sabers without hesitation. They just did as they were told.</p>
   <p>The others returned to training, while I watched. Ryder helped everyone to get back into rhythm offering suggestions, and then he rejoined me sitting on the ground next to my chair.</p>
   <p>“How do you do it?” I squinted from the sun as it reached its highest point. The temperature had begun to rise to the normal August levels.</p>
   <p>“You have to understand that Aurora is more powerful than anything on the planet, and the man in charge of all that wants you dead. You can not hesitate. If you do, you die.” Ryder leaned back on his arms basking in the sunlight, "I can’t say that there will always be someone to watch your back.”</p>
   <p>“So why put ourselves in their path by going on what seems like suicide missions?”</p>
   <p>“If we just hide here forever, they’ve won.” He looked me in the eyes, “I don’t know about you, but I don’t want to hide my whole life. This little town is great and all, but I have a feeling that they will find it eventually, and when they do there is nothing stopping them from leveling it.”</p>
   <p>“You don’t think that Sam can keep us safe?”</p>
   <p>“It’s a team effort. He is only one man, he needs our help.” He stood up from the ground and brushed himself off. He held out his hand, “Now let’s get back to work.”</p>
   <p>I took his outstretched hand and pulled myself up. He let go when I had my balance, and took a few steps back. He balled his fists and spread his legs to give him perfect balance.</p>
   <p>“Give me your best.” He yelled over the explosions in the field behind us.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>When we got back to the house I could feel the bruises from fighting Ryder. I knew he was taking it easy on me too. I did learn a lot about defending myself.</p>
   <p>I went up to my bedroom and laid down in bed.</p>
   <p>I woke up after a few hour nap when Ronnie knocked on the doorframe.  "Hey, the showers are open.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks.” I heaved my sore body up off the bed.</p>
   <p>I grabbed a new set of clean clothes and went down to the first level. When we had gotten home the sun was still up, but now it was pitch black outside. I went into the bathroom and looked at my side where there was a nice bruise starting to show.</p>
   <p>I had taken so many face plants to the ground but every time I just got back up and rushed Ryder again. No less than twenty times he asked me if I wanted to stop. He kept telling me that we could pick up the training another day.</p>
   <p>I didn’t want to stop. I needed to be doing something.</p>
   <p>I took my shower and then went back to bed.</p>
   <p>Sleep came quickly that night.</p>

    <p>Chapter 15: Past</p>
   </title>
   <p>I could hardly get out of the bed the next morning. I forced myself to crawl out of bed and go down to the kitchen to satisfy my stomach’s need for food. It growled loudly but there wasn’t anyone around to hear it. Everyone had left already for the practice field.</p>
   <p>For the second time I had to wash dishes before I had a bowl to eat cereal. Once I had my brand cereal and milk I curled up on the couch to doctor my bruises while I watched TV.</p>
   <p>There was nothing on that I wanted to watch so I just stared at the wall and ate my brunch. Once I had finished I cleaned up everyone’s mess.</p>
   <p>I heard someone pull into the driveway so I investigated. I was so bored I was praying for something that I could do. Sam was getting out of his truck.</p>
   <p>He knocked on the door, but didn’t wait before coming in, “Oh good, you’re up.”</p>
   <p>“Yup, just picking my brain for something to keep my mind occupied for a while.” I pointed to the dishes that I had hand washed even though there was a dishwasher.</p>
   <p>“Well, the doctor would like to see you immediately.”</p>
   <p>“Let’s go then.” I pulled on my shoes and we left.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>When we arrived at the clinic Doctor Z was waiting outside. He was almost bouncing on his heels in excitement yet Sam was somber as we got out of the truck. I couldn’t help but to wonder what was wrong with this strange man.</p>
   <p>“Ah, Grace I have wonderful news, please come into my lab.” He directed me with his arm outstretched. I followed Sam who led the way through the clinic to Doctor Z’s lab.</p>
   <p>“Have a seat, please.” Sam sat on the doctor stool.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z shut the door, “I have been going over your test results from the other day coupled with scans that we took while you were at level six within the Aurora facility.”</p>
   <p>“Alright.” I wasn’t following as the small man zipped all over the room showing me different images.</p>
   <p>“These are, I must say, nothing short of magnificent.” Dr. Z rambled, “Anyway, I have been working on a drug that can remove your mental block.”</p>
   <p>“Completely?”</p>
   <p>“It could, or only slightly.” He sighed, "It could also do nothing at all.”</p>
   <p>“Alright,” I thought for a moment, “I’m in.”</p>
   <p>“Grace I want you to know I’m against this, I think you should work through this, on your own.” Sam voiced his opinion.</p>
   <p>“There is one other thing.” Doctor Z Said, “If it works as designed it won’t just get rid of the mental block that prevents your powers; it will remove all mental blocks.”</p>
   <p>“Really, I don’t think that I have any other mental blocks.” I joked.</p>
   <p>“This is serious Grace, you could unlock horrible memories that you don’t want to remember, you were an orphan.” Sam paced around the room running his fingers through his hair. He was determined to talk me out of using the drug.</p>
   <p>“I remember every bit of that.” I growled.</p>
   <p>“You may have to spend more time putting the blocks back up, then it would take to just work through this one.” He continued to pace.</p>
   <p>“Sam, look, I’m ok with this.” I stopped him and looked into his eyes.</p>
   <p>“Alright, Alright. Let’s do it.” He finally let up.</p>
   <p>I laid down on the table. Doctor Z rolled up my sleeve and sterilized a spot on my arm. He opened a small plastic case where he removed a small syringe full of glowing purple liquid.</p>
   <p>“This will hurt, at first.” Dr. Z was sure to inform me.</p>
   <p>He pushed the needle into my vein and emptied the chemical into my blood. He pulled the needle back out and replaced it in the case.</p>
   <p>I felt burning as the chemical coursed through my body. My legs began to shake. Slowly, the movement shook up my arms. My whole body began to shake. I tried to keep my eyes open but my eye lids became more and more heavy.</p>
   <p>I fainted.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p><emphasis>I was knee high. I couldn’t see over any counters, or anything for that matter. Beside me stood a man and a woman, who seemed familiar, but that’s all.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“My name is Joseph Madison and this is my wife Abby. We spoke on the phone.” The man spoke to a woman behind the counter.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“How may I help you today?” the woman asked.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“We had an appointment.” Mr. Madison said.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The woman looked down at the book in front of her, “Right this way.” We were led into a back room.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I was placed in a small play area where there were several toys but I just sat there. I could hear everything that was going on. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Mr. Madison, the first question that I am forced to ask is, did you bring the required compensation? Obviously you are a wealthy man.” The woman asked.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“We have the requested amount, along with instructions for an account that will be injected with one million dollars when she reaches eighteen, safely. My work is getting increasingly dangerous and I don’t want my daughter to be a part of it.” My father explained.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Alright, the child’s name?” </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Her name is Grace. I want her to disappear. I do not want her to seek us out. I want her to think that we are both dead.” He slid an elaborate wooden case across the table to the woman. “Inside this box is a tracking system that will lead you to the girl when she is eighteen years old. It will not activate until then. When she is of age I want her restored to her place as the inheritor of my estate. I will be dead by the time she is of age I am afraid, and if by some chance I am not, all the better.” </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I hope to have her in a family rather quickly; she is such a cute child. We have a back story and fake records prepared already.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Everything got very fuzzy and the room dissolved into thin air.</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I woke in Doctor Z’s lab covered in sweat and shot bolt upright, “What do you know about Joseph Madison?”</p>
   <p>“He used to own all of this; he died a few years back.” Sam said, “Why?”</p>
   <p>“I just had a hell of a dream.” I rubbed my head.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” Doctor Z asked.</p>
   <p>“My parents were getting rid of me.” I closed my eyes trying to remember all the details. “My father was Joseph Madison.”</p>
   <p>“I will look into it.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>“Can you use your abilities?” Doctor Z was irritated with the detour that we had taken away from the reason he gave me the treatment.</p>
   <p>I held out my hand and concentrated on a powerful flame. Foot high flames burst out of my palm.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z clapped his hands and whelped for joy. Sam smiled but still looked disturbed.</p>
   <p>I got off of the bed, my legs a little weak as I stood up, and ignited my other hand with flames.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to take another scan, keep the flames active.” Doctor Z brought out the electronic crown and placed it once again on my head.</p>
   <p>“Could you dial them back a bit though?” Sam worried that I might burn the place down.</p>
   <p>I lowered the flames down to a two inch height while the good doctor took his readings. As the results began to appear, he frowned.</p>
   <p>“This is interesting.” He projected the picture to the big screen.</p>
   <p>The lines were similar to the earlier scan. The blackness that they thought was a mental block was still there, but it was much smaller and only the extreme ends of the graphs were blocked.</p>
   <p>“It was only partially successful. You may only be able to use your powers in the tier three ranges. And that may be only with extreme concentration.” Doctor Z zoomed into the blocked areas.</p>
   <p>“I’ll work on it; I mean at least I can use my powers some.” I smiled and took the scanner off of my head, “Thank you doctor.”</p>
   <p>He took the scanner and put it back in its case, “Please keep me updated on any changes.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 16: Emotions</p>
   </title>
   <p><emphasis>I lay on the ground in the middle of that desert again looking up at the sky. I couldn’t remember how I had gotten there, but I wasn’t worried about it. I was content to just lay there in the warm sand.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Clouds began to fill the sky, threatening to dump rain down on top of me. I decided that I could do one of two things; lay there and get rained on, or I could try and find some shelter. I turned my head either way, and couldn’t see anything until the horizon. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>So I just laid there. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Lightening struck behind where I was laying inches from my head. It scared the crap out of me, and when the light from the flash finally went away I was somewhere else altogether. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>It was an old Victorian era house, white with peeling paint. I recognized the house but I couldn’t remember from where or when. Since I was somehow now standing, I decided to walk inside and take a look around.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>As I walked through the front door I was hit by a massive cold chill that shook my whole body. I rubbed my shoulders, and started to look around the house.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Hello.” I said aloud.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>There was nothing but silence. I checked the rooms on the first floor. Every single one was either empty or the door was locked. I became frustrated with one door, and melted the handle, but before I could actually open the door the handle had reappeared. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The memory of this house scratched at the back of my head. I knew that I had been in it before. The kitchen was empty and so was the living room.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I decided to finally stop wondering around on the bottom floor, and go upstairs. Each step creaked under my footsteps. When I reached the landing at the top of the stairs the memory hit me like a ton of bricks. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The house came back and even the night. I remembered what was happening now. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>And it was too late to turn back.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I walked down the hallway where my room had been. This house was one of the orphanages that I had lived in as a young child before I was sent to Hillside.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I looked into the doorway and there I stood. Eleven years old against the back wall. I was crying and holding a stuffed animal. My hair was a mess and there was a smashed table next to my bed. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>He stood on the other side of the room. Furious, but crying as well. The man’s name was George Halaway. He was one of the caretakers along with his wife and one other woman for this orphanage. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I don’t understand it!” He yelled, spit flying everywhere.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“What are you talking about?” the other me sobbed from across the room.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Whenever I am near you, your thoughts get inside my head.” He pounded on his own skull trying to understand the emotions inside of his head, “Why must you torture me?”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Looking at it from this angle, it looked so pathetic. This grown man yelling at a young girl because he felt sad when he was around her. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>He walked over to the younger me and knelt down in front of me. He grabbed my shoulders and shook me, “What are you doing to me?”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I’m not doing anything.” the young me cried.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I rubbed my neck because I knew what was going to happen next. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>He wrapped both hands around the young me’s neck and squeezed, “Make it stop! Make it stop!” </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I rushed over and tried to grab the man as my younger self’s body began to go limp from oxygen deprivation. My hands went through the man. I remembered that I was in a dream, or a memory, or something. I forced myself to remember that this was all in the past. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>My younger self gasped the words, “please stop.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Stop! Stop! Stop!” he yelled like a maniac.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>A woman rushed into the room. Her name was Rebecca. She was not George’s wife, but the other woman that managed the orphanage.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She grabbed George and pulled him off of the other me.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Get off of her!” she yelled.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>He let go of the younger me’s neck sending me crumbling into the ground gasping for air. Rebecca ran over and scooped me up into her arms. She left the room and rushed down stairs where all of the other children were waiting and listening to what was going on.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She put the young me into the back seat of a car and then got into the driver’s seat. I climbed into the passenger seat so that I could listen to what happened next.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She started to drive in a hurry. She took her cell phone from the seat where I was sitting. It felt strange to see someone put their hand through me. She held the phone to her ear and said, “Call James.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>After a few seconds she said, “I have a natural. I don’t know how she got past the screenings, but she should be a good candidate for the C-series.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I could hear a man on the other end of the phone but I couldn’t make out what he was saying. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“She was able to project her emotions onto another person. Best emotional projection that I have ever seen, even from some of the people that have focused on learning to control it most of their lives. It was extremely effective.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>More that I couldn’t understand.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“But sir I think that she should be brought in for at least observation.” She pleaded with the man on the phone.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She waited, “No, the Hillside location is not ready yet. If I put her back in the system I am going to lose her. Like I said, she has gotten through screenings before. She may be able to hide her ability completely. It almost got her killed.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>A pause, “I can’t take her back to that orphanage. A man tried to kill her. I assume that he was very susceptible to the girl’s ability and couldn’t take it anymore. He may try to hurt her again.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Yes sir, I will have him terminated.” She said after a final pause then hung up the phone.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>She threw it through me and sighed loudly. She slammed her hands on the steering wheel and pulled the car over to the side of the road. She looked around for a few seconds then she looked up into the rearview mirror, and smiled as I slept in the back seat.</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I woke with steam rising from my skin. I was sweating; it was from my nerves. The sweat was evaporating almost instantly.</p>
   <p>I climbed out of bed, in the hallway I could see that the sun was still down. I slowly shambled down to the first level and into the bathroom. I turned the water on full blast, cold, and stepped into the stream still fully clothed.</p>
   <p>The water evaporated like my sweat had, billowing in the air of the small bathroom. The thick white cloud of vapor made it hard to breath.</p>
   <p>I just stood there until the steaming stopped and I actually felt the cold chill me. I turned off the water. I climbed out of the shower grabbing a towel.</p>
   <p>I dried what I could and left the bathroom.</p>
   <p>I took the steps one at a time.</p>
   <p>It took me a few moments to find clean, dry clothes, and get dressed. My head was killing me and I didn’t want to turn on the light. I laid back down in my bed and stared at the ceiling. I saw nothing but darkness but could feel the memories of that man’s hands around my neck.</p>
   <p>I played the parts of the dream that I could remember in my head over and over again.</p>
   <p>I wondered what it all meant. I had caused a man so much sorrow that he tried to kill me and I was only eleven years old. Rebecca had told the person on the phone that I had used emotional projection. I couldn’t remember ever seeing Rebecca again after that incident or the man for that matter.</p>
   <p>I had to find out what exactly emotional projection meant and if I was still able to do that. I have to keep myself from torturing anyone else with my emotions; I hardly understood what was going on in my head. I didn’t need anyone else to suffer because of me.</p>
   <p>There was a soft knock on my door.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” I turned my head over to look at whoever opened the door.</p>
   <p>Kenny leaned against the door frame with his arms crossed, "Hey, was that you that got up and took a shower?”</p>
   <p>“It was.” I sat up.</p>
   <p>“Are you sick?” He looked worried, "I was watching TV and you walked by like a zombie and ignored me.”</p>
   <p>“I guess you could call it that.” I smiled. "I didn’t mean to ignore you.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry about it; most people are zombies this time of night. You want to talk about what’s on your mind?”</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t know what to talk about if I wanted to.” I sighed.</p>
   <p>“Come on, you used to talk to me all the time. You know that I won’t say anything to anybody.” he was right. There weren’t many secrets among the four of us, but if there was ever something, Kenny was my go to guy.</p>
   <p>“What about Sandy, you two don’t keep secrets.” I picked at him.</p>
   <p>“We don’t keep secrets from each other that pertain to the two of us but this is your thing and that doesn’t count.” he remained perfectly cool.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that I have told anyone about what happened to me before I came to Hillside, partly because I didn’t remember most of my past.” I laid back down onto my side.</p>
   <p>“Nope, I figured it was a touchy subject.”</p>
   <p>“Well, I had blocked most of it out. What I could remember back then was pretty rough.” I took a deep breath. "I was having problems with my abilities and Doctor Z thought that it was linked to a mental block. He gave me a drug that he created to get rid of blocks, but it got rid of them all. I just relived a memory that I wish I never had. I should have listened to Sam.”</p>
   <p>“What happened?” he listened closely.</p>
   <p>“At this old orphanage that I used to live at there was a male caretaker. His name was George. He tried to kill me.” I forced the tears away.</p>
   <p>“Why?”</p>
   <p>I contemplated telling him everything that I had remembered but decided against it. "I don’t know why. I went to therapy for a while before moving to Hillside. George was let go, or terminated was the word they used, and I never saw him again. Didn’t bother me.”</p>
   <p>“Wow, no wonder you got sick.” he sat down on the floor next to my bed and leaned back.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” I chuckled, "I think that other than a therapist, you are the only person that I have told any of this to.”</p>
   <p>“You want to know something?”</p>
   <p>“What’s that?” I let my hand fall off the side. He took it and held it like I imagined a brother would.</p>
   <p>“I had abilities before we were abducted.”</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” I knew exactly what he meant.</p>
   <p>“From as far back as I can remember I have been able to heal things.”</p>
   <p>“Like how?”</p>
   <p>He let go of my hand and reached into his pocket. He took out a pocket knife and opened the blade.</p>
   <p>“Whoa, wait, what are you doing?” I grabbed his hand.</p>
   <p>“Just watch.” He placed the blade to the skin of his arm. He gently applied pressure and slid the blade slowly down his flesh. Blood began to slide out from the split skin. He cleaned the blade and closed it swiftly returning the knife to his pocket while his arm bled.</p>
   <p>“For God’s sake!” I got up to go for the light but he grabbed my pants, stopping me.</p>
   <p>With his other hand, he ran his index finger over the wound. As the blood pooled under his finger the cut vanished leaving no sign of a scar at all.</p>
   <p>“Don’t ever do that again.”</p>
   <p>“No one else knows that I can do that.” He cleaned up the remaining blood with his shirt.</p>
   <p>“Your secret is safe with me.” I got back into my bed.</p>
   <p>“I’m here with an ear.” he stood from his spot on the floor, "Feel better?”</p>
   <p>I thought for a moment and realized that I did feel better, "Yeah, I’m going to try and sleep the rest of the night.” I smiled.</p>
   <p>“Alright, well let me know anytime you want to talk.” He left the room closing the door.</p>
   <p>It felt good to let things out. I knew telling him about the other ability that I may or may not have was a bad idea, but knowing that he had a second ability made me think that our ending up at that orphanage was not a coincidence.</p>
   <p>I wondered if any of the others had abilities as I began to get drowsy and fall asleep.</p>

    <p>Chapter 17: Sear</p>
   </title>
   <p>The next morning Sam took us to his office; one of the buildings that I had thought was abandoned. They hadn’t gotten around to doing any maintenance.</p>
   <p>“What is on the agenda for today?” I looked like hell from my rough night.</p>
   <p>“Today we are going to figure out your government approved education level.” Sam stood at the front of the room, while the rest of us sat behind a long table spaced evenly apart.</p>
   <p>“And how are we going to do that?” Ronnie leaned back in his chair and crossed his arm. He looked bored.</p>
   <p>“With the ELAT.” Sam smiled.</p>
   <p>“What is the ELAT?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“The E.L.A.T. Education Level Assessment Test.” He paced a few steps in either direction.</p>
   <p>We all groaned in unison at the prospect of a test. School was something that we were all ready to leave in the past.</p>
   <p>“I know. I know. Its two hundred and fifty questions and you have three hours to finish. We will go over the results together when everyone is finished.” He passed out the tests to everyone. Each packet had a different designation on the front page making it clear that each one was very different.</p>
   <p>Once everyone had a test, pencil, and a calculator he sat down behind a desk at the edge of the room, "Get started.” He pressed the start button on a timer.</p>
   <p>The test was simple, but it did get harder as I went deeper into the pages. All of the questions were based on information that we had seen dozens of times.</p>
   <p>I breezed through the material in about two hours. I closed the booklet and set back in my chair. I started to draw some lines on the corner of a scrap sheet of paper.</p>
   <p>Sam came over and took my packet without saying a word. He returned to his desk to grade my work.</p>
   <p>Everyone finished well before time was up, and we all sat quietly while Sam graded the tests. After he finished he passed them back out.</p>
   <p>“Here is how this works.” He clapped his hands together and looked around the room, "The grade that you have determines your average education level. If you score high enough, we, and the government, will consider you a graduate and issue you a diploma. We have no way to pinpoint where you need to start without the test. Let’s just say that Aurora did not think your education was a priority.”</p>
   <p>“Alrighty then, I like the sound of that.” Kenny blurted out.</p>
   <p>“Two hundred and ten points plus tells us that you are of high school graduate level education, 250 is a perfect score.” Sam pointed to the tests.</p>
   <p>I opened my packet and turned to the front page. In thick black numbers two-two-nine was scrawled across the page. I breathed a sigh of relief.</p>
   <p>We all scored high enough to be done with school. Rachel had been the closest; she had been held for so long. When we asked how she could have known all the information she said that they were teaching her, but she left it at that, and didn’t want to elaborate.</p>
   <p>Ryder met me outside of Sam’s office. He seemed excited about talking to me. We walked along in quiet for a few minutes past the house and just kept walking.</p>
   <p>“I had a word with Sam.” he broke the silence finally.</p>
   <p>“Really, was it just one, or was there an entire conversation?” I laughed at my own joke then felt stupid for being so self centered. He was kind of acting awkward, but happy.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, we think that it would be great if you wanted to work up in the observatory. Fade tried to teach a few people to care for it, but no one was as interested in it as she was.” He kept his eyes averted.</p>
   <p>“Really? That’s cool.”</p>
   <p>“Well, you seemed so interested the other day. A hobby would be good we think. I’ve seen some downward spirals from a user getting too bored.”</p>
   <p>“When can we get started?” I squinted up to the top of the mountain. I could just make out the sparkle of the landing at the mountain’s highest point.</p>
   <p>“We?” he seemed surprised that I’d want his help.</p>
   <p>“I assume that you would want to come up and help, given that it used to be Fade’s project.” I didn’t care if he wanted to help or not, I really didn’t want to be alone on the top of a mountain.</p>
   <p>“How, um…” he looked in the air around my head for the word.</p>
   <p>“Presumptuous.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Not what I was going to say, but I guess that works.” he scratched his head awkwardly; "I don’t know if I’ll be much help.”</p>
   <p>“To be honest I don’t care how much help you’ll be.” I said bluntly, "I don’t want to be in a new place on top of a mountain alone.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that I can go up tonight. How about tomorrow?” He checked the time on his smart phone.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, that sounds good.” I was disappointed that I couldn’t get started immediately, but I hadn’t even opened my new laptop yet, and I would want to use it to keep up with my work.</p>
   <p>We looped back around and returned to the house. The whole group was home either watching TV or using the computer in the den.</p>
   <p>I went up to my room and grabbed my new computer. I opened up the box, took out all of the packaging, and tossed it into the trash. I plugged the charger into the wall, and into the computer. When I opened the lid and pressed the power button it didn’t take long to boot up.</p>
   <p>The computer asked me a few questions about where I was and what the current time was. When it booted to the desktop it notified me that there were wifi networks available. I connected to the one with the strongest signal that didn’t require a password.</p>
   <p>I opened internet explorer, I hadn’t been online in over a month. I tried to check my e-mail, but the account was gone. Every account that I had had was gone. I searched for myself on Google, but only found pictures of the girl who had replaced me.</p>
   <p>Even my Facebook page was changed to reflect the replacement’s life, which was better than mine according to her page. More power to her.</p>
   <p>I was happy to leave it all behind.</p>
   <p>I remembered that Sam wanted us to come up with code names that we could use when we went on missions. I went to back Google, and typed <emphasis>synonyms for fire</emphasis> in the search bar, and hit enter. I clicked on a link and read the page. There were dozens of words and one the stuck out was Sear. It was kind of plain, but it was quick to say, and easy to remember.</p>
   <p>Sear: Verb, to burn or scorch the surface of something with a sudden intense heat.</p>
   <p>There was a knock on my door.</p>
   <p>“Come in.” I closed the lid on the computer.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>Ronnie opened the door and sighed, looking troubled about something, "Can we go for a walk.”</p>
   <p>“Sure, let me get a hoodie. What’s up?” I got up, and put the computer on the bedside table. I went to my closet and grabbed a sweater pulling it on over my t-shirt.</p>
   <p>We left the house and started to walk down the side of the road. He didn’t say anything, but he seemed like he was trying to start a conversation few times.</p>
   <p>“Would you spit it out already?” I stopped him and turned him to look at me.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what to say exactly.” he said wringing his hands.</p>
   <p>We started walking again.</p>
   <p>“Just say whatever it is.”</p>
   <p>“Well you see I have been spending a lot of time with Rachel lately.” he said stammering like a school boy with a crush.</p>
   <p>“You like her. You want to hold her.” I said in a sing song voice.</p>
   <p>“Stop Grace. I’m serious.” he looked at the ground.</p>
   <p>“Sorry.” I backed away.</p>
   <p>“I have feelings for her. Feelings that I have never had before.” he smiled but looked like he was going to be sick.</p>
   <p>“What? Do you want my permission to date her?” I was amazed that we were even discussing his love life.</p>
   <p>“Well?”</p>
   <p>“Ronnie, what did I tell you right after your fight with Josh at school?” I stopped him again, but less forceful.</p>
   <p>“Well, I just want to know that if we really got serious, things wouldn’t get weird between us.” he had the hardest time making eye contact with me.</p>
   <p>“I will always love you like a brother. Nothing can change that, no matter what. No matter who you are in a relationship with, things will always get weird between us. Now.” I took a breath, "Where was I. Oh yeah… You LOVE her.” again in the sing song voice.</p>
   <p>“So… What does this mean?” we started back towards the house.</p>
   <p>“We’re still friends and now I get to mess with you because, you love her.” I chuckled pushing him.</p>
   <p>“Thanks.” He playfully shoved me back.</p>
   <p>Rachel waited for us right inside the front door. He gave her a little nod and she grinned at me. They walked into the kitchen arm in arm.</p>
   <p>I shook my head.</p>
   <p>I returned to my room and surfed the net until I fell asleep with the laptop on my stomach.</p>

    <p>Chapter 18: The Will</p>
   </title>
   <p>Ronnie and Rachel spent no time getting close. I sat at the table during breakfast a few days later trying to keep my food down while being subjected to their displays.</p>
   <p> I left the house and walked aimlessly towards the town. The sunlight felt wonderful on my skin. Sam and Ryder came out of Sam’s office and as I passed by, their words fell to a whisper.</p>
   <p>“Morning.” I tried to interrupt their conversation.</p>
   <p>“Good morning Grace.” Sam smiled but returned quickly to the hushed conversation.</p>
   <p>“Hey.” Ryder nodded. The two of them continued down the sidewalk.</p>
   <p>Once they had finished, Ryder nodded then ran to catch up with me.</p>
   <p>“What’s up?” I stopped and sat down on a concrete half wall.</p>
   <p>“I was hoping that we could go up to the observatory tonight.” he sat down next to me. His phone went off but he ignored the message.</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” We still hadn’t gone up to the top of the mountain. We had planned to, but things came up each night, "What were you talking to Sam about?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing.” He kept his face expressionless.</p>
   <p>“Hmm… Ok, I’ve got your number.” I also remained straight faced, "Well how about this? I came up with a code name.”</p>
   <p>“Really and that would be?” He asked relieved for the change of subject.</p>
   <p>“What do you think about…” I paused for effect, "Sear?”</p>
   <p>“Sear?” the words came flatly and it irritated me.</p>
   <p>“What? I like it.”</p>
   <p>“It’s good, it’s to the point.” he hopped down from the wall and pulled his phone from his pocket.</p>
   <p>“I’ll see you tonight.” I jumped down and continued towards the area where there were a few small shops set up.</p>
   <p>“Wait.” he held out his arm trying to stop me but he didn’t look up from his phone.</p>
   <p>“I’ll see you tonight Ryder.” I held up my hand.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>The hours seemed like they would last forever. I must have checked the time a hundred times, sure that any second Ryder would call canceling on me again.</p>
   <p>He didn’t call. He knocked on the door just as the sun was disappearing over the horizon. We walked to the observatory entrance bathed in the glow of street lamps.</p>
   <p>“So where do you want to get started?” we rode the elevator up, and got out onto the landing at the top of the mountain.</p>
   <p>“We need to clean the mirrors and we also need to reconfigure the computers.” I clapped my hands together and looked around the room.</p>
   <p>“I’ll take the mirrors, I think that will be the safest thing for me to do.” He went into a closet and found cleaning solution and a bag of rags. He disappeared into the first dome.</p>
   <p>I sat down at the center work station and booted the computer. I set my computer up on the table next to the monitor and booted it as well. My laptop booted ten times faster.</p>
   <p>Everything on the main computer was the same as the first time we had visited the observatory. I clicked on the settings icon. There were two options, manual configuration and the other was automatic configuration <emphasis>using last known good configuration</emphasis>. I didn’t click on either, the telescopes would start moving and I didn’t want to get Ryder hurt.</p>
   <p>I joined Ryder outside in the first dome, "How goes it in here?”</p>
   <p>“Luckily the filth on the mirrors is coming off very easily.” he wiped sweat off his brow. I had no idea how he could be sweating, it was like less than fifty degrees in the dome.</p>
   <p>I grabbed an extra rag from the stack that he had sitting on the ground next to the door. I put some of the cleaning solution on it and then went to the next mirror.</p>
   <p>“You don’t need to do that, go on inside and turn on the heat.” he smiled. He got really close to me, and looked over my shoulder at the mirror that I had started on. The hairs of the back of my neck stood on end.</p>
   <p>He snatched the rag out of my hand, "If you insist.” I slipped underneath his arm and walked back into the control room.</p>
   <p>I found the thermostat and turned the heat to seventy. Almost immediately, I could smell burning dust from all of the vents. I had a flash back to high school when they would fire up the heaters the first cold day of the year.</p>
   <p>I returned to the computers and started to boot the rest. I went to my laptop and searched for things that were cool to look at in the night sky. I found a few suggestions and bookmarked the sites in the browser. Each one had detailed instructions on locating the anomalies.</p>
   <p>“All done.” Ryder rejoined me in the control room after replacing the cleaning supplies in the closet.</p>
   <p>“Well let’s see how this works.” I clicked on configure <emphasis>using last known good settings</emphasis>. I hoped that when the hard drives lost their data they didn’t lose the configuration files.</p>
   <p>The computer started to work on its own. The first monitor showed two windows. One flickered on and a live camera feed from inside the dome appeared. The telescope started to move around in all directions. A timer flashed on the main screen <emphasis>2:00:00.</emphasis></p>
   <p>“We’ve got two hours until it’s finished with the configuration.” I swiveled in my chair to look at Ryder who was leaning on a nearby wall.</p>
   <p>“Well this is the perfect time for us to talk.” he walked out of the room. When he returned he had two glass soda bottles in one hand and a folder in his other hand.</p>
   <p>“What’s that?” I didn’t care about the drinks, the folder worried me.</p>
   <p>“It’s something that is very important.” he handed me one of the bottles, and pulled up a chair. I opened it and took a sip.</p>
   <p>He took a deep breath.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” I asked again, he was getting very serious.</p>
   <p>“I have spent some time with Sam the past couple of days and we have been looking into Joseph Madison.”</p>
   <p>“Really? What did you find?” I was suddenly very excited.</p>
   <p>“Well he and his wife died two years ago.” he paused.</p>
   <p>“You told me that.” I leaned back into my chair.</p>
   <p>“I did, but I didn’t tell you how. Until now we never needed to know why. We found the police, and coroner’s reports, and the deaths are interesting to say the least.”</p>
   <p>“Interesting how?”</p>
   <p>“Well, there was no cause of death, and they died at the exact same moment. The police were positive that it was a murder, but without a cause of death, and zero evidence at the scene of the crime, a hotel in Las Vegas, which I found weird, they had to drop the case.”</p>
   <p>“So what do you think?”</p>
   <p>“I think that they were killed by a mod or nat.”</p>
   <p>“What else did you find out?” I really wanted to know if I was his daughter or not and it felt like he was stringing me along.</p>
   <p>“Joseph Madison had two children, Grace Madison and Isabel Madison. We have already worked up your DNA, and compared it to his. You are his daughter.”</p>
   <p>I felt a tear in my eye, but I pushed it back, "Where is Isabel?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t been able to locate her. I did find this.” he held up the folder, "this is Joseph’s last will and testament.”</p>
   <p>I took it from him, and opened it. I skimmed over most of it until I saw my name.</p>
   <p><emphasis>And to my daughter, Grace Madison, in order to repay her for having abandoned her at such a young age, I leave her every one of my worldly possessions, and any and all funds that may remain that she may use it to have a better life . I know that it cannot begin to repair the damage that I may have caused in her life, but I would hope that she could find it in her heart to forgive me and her mother for our actions. We only wished for her to have a life free of ridicule and shame. The only thing that I wish of her is that she should locate her sister, and try to create a meaningful relationship with her. We would like both of you to know that we love you and will always be with you.</emphasis></p>
   <p>Tears had weld up in my eyes now, to know a piece of my past, that I had family, was a great feeling. Ryder had moved beside me and put his arm around my shoulder.</p>
   <p>“I looked up some history, if you want to know.”</p>
   <p>“Umm… sure.” I wasn’t really sure what he meant by history.</p>
   <p>“Joseph owned a huge technology company called AdvaGen Technologies, several factories across the world, the whole nine yards. He had this observatory constructed as a hobby for his wife. When his company was denied a government contract due to a technicality, he had to put it all up for sale. The observatory first and then the company.” he looked at the ground.</p>
   <p>“Aurora purchased the company and all of your father’s brilliant designs.”</p>
   <p>“So you are telling me that the technology that they use was created by my father?” I could feel my face turning red from anger.</p>
   <p>“Things like vehicles. Yes.”</p>
   <p>“What about the devices that they used to give us these abilities?” I set my hands ablaze.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” He shrugged and gave me a little space.</p>
   <p>“What about the other girl? The one that I saw back at the school. Isn’t she technically the real me now?” I changed the subject.</p>
   <p>“She is the real Grace Ward according to the government, but you are the real Grace Madison. By making you go by Ward, Joseph was doing you a big favor. When it came to your abduction, Aurora replaced Grace Ward.”</p>
   <p>“I want to go to the house, see if I can figure anything else out.”</p>
   <p>“Sure. We may have to break in.”</p>
   <p>“It’s my house; I think that we will get away with it.”</p>
   <p>I turned back to the main computer, the configuration was finished, and all of the telescopes but two were working. All of the monitors were showing a panoramic, very up-close view of the moon. It was beautiful.</p>
   <p>“It’s wonderful.”</p>
   <p>“I think that I just found my new favorite place.” I grinned.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 19: PCD-003</p>
   </title>
   <p>Given that we got home so late I was surprised that I was up out of bed bright and early. I was eager to check out my father’s old house. I was primed and ready to learn as much about my past as I could.</p>
   <p>I was sure that it was foolish to assume that I would be able to find something that the police overlooked, but I was optimistic for the first time since as far back as I can remember.</p>
   <p>I had to wait around for a few hours while Ryder finished his assignments that Sam had given him.</p>
   <p>He picked me up in the mid afternoon.</p>
   <p>“How are you feeling today?” I climbed into the passenger seat of the car and buckled my seat belt.</p>
   <p>“Better, I guess. I still feel like there is a huge gap up here.” I pointed to my head.</p>
   <p>He smiled and nodded towards the road, "Are you ready to go?”</p>
   <p>“Never been this ready for anything before.” I grinned.</p>
   <p>There was only one road leading out of town and Sam was waiting at the entrance. He leaned on the side of his truck with a heavy look in his eyes. My heart dropped into the pit of my stomach, the first thing that came to my mind was him not letting us go to the house.</p>
   <p>“What’s this about?” I shifted in my seat.</p>
   <p>“He knows what we are doing. This must be about the meeting he attended this morning.”</p>
   <p>Ryder pulled the car over and put it into park, "What’s up boss?”</p>
   <p>Sam walked over and knelt down by the driver’s window, "Two things before you guys head out.” He looked both directions before continuing in a lower voice, “I want you to be careful. This man was a technological genius and we don’t know what he could have left behind. And secondly when you get back we need to do a crash course in combat training for Grace, we have a mission. No one else knows who she is yet. Best to keep that under wraps I think.” He sighed and glanced back at the town.</p>
   <p>Ryder nodded.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that things are as secure as they once were here.” Sam added before taking a step back from the car and allowing us to leave.</p>
   <p>“What kind of mission do you think that he is sending us on?” We were on the main road.</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“There has been talk about the facility you escaped from; they think that there is information there we can use.” It wasn’t long until we pulled off the main road and onto the old dirt road that led to the lake house.</p>
   <p>A mile down the road we passed through a damaged gate that had once blocked the driveway. The lot was massive, a house, garage, boat house, and a separate cabin rested next to a dock that was partially submerged in the lake. Everything looked weather beaten, but perfectly intact.</p>
   <p>Ryder parked the car in front of the main entrance, a huge door that was two stories high.</p>
   <p>We sat in quiet for a moment and then I opened my door after I decided that waiting would accomplish nothing. Ryder joined me on the other side of the car. He didn’t say anything even though I could see on his face the urge to say something.</p>
   <p>“How hard do you think it is going to be to get in?”</p>
   <p>“Worst case scenario we break a window and then we have someone replace it…” he inspected the windows either side of the door.</p>
   <p>“I’d like to avoid that if at all possible.” I walked right up to the front door and placed my hand on the wood. There were no handles or knobs. There weren’t even any visible hinges holding the massive doors in the frame. I wondered how one would open the door at any normal point in time. I reached out and pushed on the door, it didn’t budge.</p>
   <p>“Over here.” Ryder was standing at the left hand side of the door.</p>
   <p>There was an electrical panel on the wall. He opened the panel’s door, and inside there was a small computer screen, a key pad, and a ring that could fit a person’s hand.</p>
   <p>Ryder reached out to put his hand into the ring.</p>
   <p>“Wait.” I held out my hand to stop him.</p>
   <p>“What,” he jumped back.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that it is going to work for you.”</p>
   <p>“You scared the crap out of me.” He pumped his fist a few times taking a deep breath and a few steps back clearing the way for me.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Please insert hand </emphasis>flashed across the screen.</p>
   <p>I stood in front of the box and took a deep breath. I reached out to put my hand in the ring. I stopped; I had no idea what was going to happen. I clenched my fist, gritted my teeth, held my breath, and put my hand into the ring.</p>
   <p>The ring closed around my wrist snuggly. It resembled a mechanical iris.</p>
   <p>“What’s happening?”</p>
   <p>“Nothing yet… It’s just getting a little snug.” I tried to pull my hand out, but it wouldn’t move. The harder that I tried to pull, the tighter the ring got around my hand.</p>
   <p>I started to panic.</p>
   <p>“Talk to me Grace.” He was also beginning to panic.</p>
   <p>“It won’t let go!” I was now pulling with my other hand.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Beginning DNA scan… </emphasis>flashed on the small screen.</p>
   <p>I heard a humming coming from inside the wall and then it felt like electricity shooting trough my hand.</p>
   <p>I yelled out in surprise.</p>
   <p>Ryder grabbed my wrist, and gently tried to pull it out of the wall.</p>
   <p>“No, no. Stop, stop.” I pulled his hand off mine.</p>
   <p>“But, Grace…” He tried again to pull my hand free.</p>
   <p>“There is a count down on the screen, only two more seconds.” I pointed to the small screen.</p>
   <p>He let go of my wrist.</p>
   <p>The countdown finished, and the pain stopped. The pressure released and I pulled out my hand squeezing it repeatedly, and shaking off the pain.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright?” He took my hand to inspect for injury.</p>
   <p>“I’m fine.” I pushed him off focusing on the information flashing across the screen.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"Grace Madison, Access allowed. Is guest welcome?” </emphasis>the computer spoke aloud. The question also displayed on the small screen.</p>
   <p>“Yes.” I shrugged to Ryder.</p>
   <p><emphasis>"What type of access should guest be allowed?"</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Um…”</p>
   <p><emphasis>"I’m sorry, your options are A) Minimal access, this allows for access to only the entrance area, and escorted areas of the house. B) Medium access, this allows for access to all areas, except those that have been deemed private. And C) Maximum access, this allows for access to the entire complex at all times."</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Maximum access.”</p>
   <p><emphasis>”Very well, please submit guest for a DNA scan whenever convenient. There is a DNA scanner located in lab number one. Thank you.” </emphasis>The computer screen flickered off.</p>
   <p>The doors started to click loudly, and they slid into the walls on either side of the doorway.</p>
   <p>There was a man dressed in a butler’s uniform on the other side of the door. He smiled from ear, to ear, "Ms. Grace Madison I had almost given up hope that you would return. Mr. Madison did tell me to never lose hope.”</p>
   <p>“Who are you?” Ryder and I walked into the dimly lit room from out of the sun.</p>
   <p>“Where are my manners? Mr. Madison did program me better than that,”</p>
   <p>“Programmed?” I interrupted him.</p>
   <p>“Yes, I am PCD-003. I am here to serve. Anything that you need ma’am, you have only to ask.” he happily bowed as we entered.</p>
   <p>“What are you?”</p>
   <p>“I am an android constructed by your father to assist him and your mother in daily duties. They were always so busy. They didn’t have time for simple things such as cooking and cleaning.” He sounded very human for claiming that he was an android.</p>
   <p>“003? Are there more of you?” Ryder asked.</p>
   <p>“Yes sir, there are four of us. There is a mechanic, he is two. Four is a doctor, here to help.”</p>
   <p>“And the first?” Ryder was walking around looking at the paintings on the walls of the entrance hallway.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Mr. Madison constructed a prototype that I have never seen. I don’t know what happened to him. Only your father knew about his details.”</p>
   <p>“Do you know what he was constructed for?” I paced around the room checking for dust. There was none.</p>
   <p>“I do not know ma’am”</p>
   <p>“Could we get a tour of the house?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Of course.” He held out his arm. I walked in the direction that he was pointing, "The kitchen and the dining room are through here.” There was a long table in the center of the room with a crystal chandelier over the center.</p>
   <p>We walked to the right wing of the house, "There are twelve bedrooms on this side of the house, all with their own bathrooms.”</p>
   <p>“Why are there so many?”</p>
   <p>“Your father would often have project managers here for long periods of time to collaborate on projects. He did not like to use phone or video conferences. He would always say there was no way to do any actual work with those things. He did most of his work here.”</p>
   <p>After showing us the first bedroom, we walked over to the left wing of the house, "this is where your father worked, there are two workshops. In one he worked on personal projects and the other is for the projects that were work related. I’ll take you to his office.”</p>
   <p>Ryder’s phone rang, "I’ll catch up.” he put his phone to his ear and wondered off in the opposite direction.</p>
   <p>The Android and I walked deeper into the left wing of the house. I stopped him, "Hold on before we go any farther. My father had to have called you something other than PCD-003.”</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am he always would call me Alrick.”</p>
   <p>“Did you like that name?”</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
   <p>“Alright that’s what I’ll call you. And you can stop calling me ma’am. Call me Grace.”</p>
   <p>“Thank you, I loved the name that your father gave me. Shall we continue?” He smiled again holding out his hand directing me.</p>
   <p>“Sure.” We went into the office. The lights came on when we walked through the door. There were several monitors mounted to the back wall surrounding one computer station with bay windows on both sides.</p>
   <p>“It will be nice to see someone back in here working. It has been a long two years. You will be continuing your father’s work? Won’t you?”</p>
   <p>“You keep saying things like <emphasis>you love, </emphasis>or <emphasis>it will be nice</emphasis> aren’t those emotions that androids wouldn’t be able the feel?” as the words came out I felt like an ass, "Don’t get me wrong it’s cool. I’m just trying to understand all of this.”</p>
   <empty-line/>
   <p>“All of us PCD’s started out the same, but given a different set of tasks and knowledge pertaining to those tasks. What he also gave us is an ability to learn and to develop emotions.”</p>
   <p>“Unbelievable, well I don’t know if I will be continuing his work. Only time will tell.”</p>
   <p>He hung his head and his shoulders drooped in disappointment. I couldn’t believe the realism in the actions.</p>
   <p>Ryder came into the room, "Grace we have to head out. Things are moving faster than Sam thought that they would.” he had a sense of urgency about him.</p>
   <p>“What is the mission?” I wanted to stay at the house and speak with Alrick and meet the other PCD’s.</p>
   <p>“Sam will explain when we get back.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be waiting; the rest will love to meet you. We will be standing by.”</p>
   <p>“It was nice to meet you. Maybe when I get some time, we can talk about my parents, and you can tell me what kind of people they were.” I nodded.</p>
   <p>He returned the nod, "I will look forward to it.”</p>

    <p>Chapter 20: Cram Session</p>
   </title>
   <p>The sun fell behind the mountains as we drove back towards Eastcroft. Ryder drove straight to the hanger at the edge of town. He parked next to Sam’s truck.</p>
   <p>“Let’s get inside, they’re waiting for us.” He seemed very worried.</p>
   <p>We got out of the car and joined Sam and the others where they patiently waited. They were standing in a group talking quietly. When Sam noticed that we had arrived he met us halfway.</p>
   <p>“Good, now we can get started.” He was impatient and somewhat agitated.</p>
   <p>“Wait a second here; you are the one that dropped this on us last minute.” I became quickly irritated with his tone.</p>
   <p>He stopped with his back to us and took a breath, "Look, I’m sorry but we have a very small window of opportunity that we have never had before, and we cannot let that window shut on us.”</p>
   <p>“I got it and I want to help, but calm down. Been through a lot in the past month.” We all gathered around a table at the back of the hanger.</p>
   <p>“All of this is equipment that we put together for you.” He picked up a handgun, ejected the clip slid it back in and primed the chamber.</p>
   <p>“What is all of this?”</p>
   <p>He picked up a smart phone, "This is your Last Line issued phone, but it’s so much more than that. You will have one hundred percent uptime and a constant connection to the ATN. If you spot anyone not in the network please snap a photo for your debriefing. These are headsets already set up for each phone.” He held up one of the headsets, when in the ear it was almost invisible.</p>
   <p>We all picked up our phones.</p>
   <p>“Why are you giving us guns?” Ronnie picked up one of the pistols from the table.</p>
   <p>“You don’t have to take them, but you have the option.” Sam handed the pistol he held out to me.</p>
   <p>I took it.</p>
   <p>“I think I’ll stick with my electricity.” He put the gun he’d picked up back down onto the table.</p>
   <p>“The watch has a holographic imager, it can overlay maps, and other things onto your surroundings.” he picked up a small box, "this has an antigravity generator. It can only do short bursts, but it will allow you to land gently when you jump out of the plane.”</p>
   <p>“Jump out of a plane?” Kenny protested taking a few steps back holding his hands up.</p>
   <p>“The plan.” we all followed him over to a table with a black glass top, "I have to thank Rachel for the Intel, and it has been verified.” He pressed a button on the table. A perfect image of the facility that we escaped from appeared hovering over the table, rotating slowly.</p>
   <p>“Has it already been rebuilt?” I asked looking for my cell where I had spent so much time.</p>
   <p>“It has and as far as the public is concerned, they begin producing power tomorrow. Here is the part that we are interested in; their communication network goes back online tomorrow morning with the power. Which means they haven’t backed up their computer system since the incident.”</p>
   <p>Rachel nodded.</p>
   <p>“Wasn’t everything destroyed?” Ronnie circled the table taking in every detail.</p>
   <p>“The local computer core is far underground.” Sam zoomed into a room that was underground; the walls vanished showing a computer the size of an SUV.</p>
   <p>“Why is the information so important?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“There are hundreds of petabytes of information, that could lead us God knows where. We could help more like us.”</p>
   <p>“We might be able to get some insight on what they had planned for you.” Ryder commented.</p>
   <p>“Exactly right.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>“What does it matter if we do it now or after the back up?”</p>
   <p>“When they back up the computer, any and all data that is not in use for particular projects will be removed, and only available on the main database. To this day we do not know the location of the main database.”</p>
   <p>“So what’s the plan then?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“We will fly over the complex in the early morning before the sun is up. The five of you will jump from the plane, and land near the complex, and then you will get inside. Once inside you will make your way to the local central computer database.” He held up one of four thumb drives. "Once there, the system uses custom encoded keys, these thumb drives are wirelessly tethered to your phone so that when they are plugged in I can hack the system remotely to allow access.”</p>
   <p>“Then what?”</p>
   <p>He opened a small metal case, "Once we are allowed access we will do a back up onto this storage device. There are twenty petabytes worth of storage. It may not be enough, but we’ll get what we can.”</p>
   <p>“What is the plan for exit?”</p>
   <p>“Break out using any means; you should only find minimal resistance. Head north, there is a small helicopter tours business that went under years ago. There will be an evac waiting for you.”</p>
   <p>“When do we head out?” Sandy finally spoke up from the back of the group.</p>
   <p>“Two hours.”</p>
   <p>Sam walked over to another table. He picked up an armor vest and a shirt.</p>
   <p>“Here are some clothes that you can wear for the mission. Scratch that, you are required to wear them.”</p>
   <p>“Black?” Sandy held up a pair of pants.</p>
   <p>“Going in the dark.” Ryder said.</p>
   <p>“These vests have been modified.” Sam said.</p>
   <p>“Modified how?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“The armor is denser and lighter.” Ryder threw one of the vests into the air and caught with one finger.</p>
   <p>“Silence take Grace out to the practice field and get some combat training in with her abilities. Be back here in one and a half hours.” Sam said.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>A half an hour later we stood on the practice field.</p>
   <p>“Give me your best shot.” Ryder stood with his feet planted ready for my attack.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure that you don’t want to use the dummies?” I didn’t want to lose control and hurt him.</p>
   <p>“Come on, you can’t hit me anyway.” he egged me on. I balled my fists and then opened them, flames licked my palms.</p>
   <p>I threw a fire ball like a baseball at Ryder.</p>
   <p>He dodged it with ease.</p>
   <p>A wooden target flew up; I threw a ball of flame at it blowing it to pieces. He appeared behind me, sweeping my legs out from underneath me.</p>
   <p>I got up rubbing my lower back.</p>
   <p>“You can do better than that.” He circled.</p>
   <p>I tried to throw another ball of flame at him, but he used a piece of the wooden target to send it back at me. It hit me in the shoulder sending me spiraling onto my back. I hit my head on the ground.</p>
   <p>I got up rubbing the back of my head. I balled my fist and started to run in his direction. I threw another ball of fire at him, but this time when he dodged I used a boost of flame to send myself flying at him.</p>
   <p>I tackled him to the ground, landing on top of him.</p>
   <p>My face was inches from his; I could feel his breath on my cheek. He grinned like a maniac, "Good job, think outside of the box, but don’t always rely on your abilities.” he chuckled.</p>
   <p>“Thank you.” I held him to the ground.</p>
   <p>“Thank you for what?”</p>
   <p>“For all your help, for everything that you have done for me.” before he could say anything I pressed my lips to his. He kissed back; sending shivers my spine.</p>
   <p>A feeling that I had never felt before.</p>
   <p>Quickly I came to my senses and jumped up off of him. I hardly knew him and I did not know how he felt for me. I cleared my throat and stood with my back to him.</p>
   <p>“You’re welcome.” he stood brushing himself off.</p>
   <p>“How do you think that I am doing?”</p>
   <p>“You’re doing great; I wasn’t pulling any punches either.” We walked to his car.</p>
   <p>“I’m nervous about this mission.” I leaned against the hood of his car.</p>
   <p>“Understandable, Sam wouldn’t usually send anyone on a mission so soon after arrival, but he doesn’t have another team available.” He leaned next to me on the car.</p>
   <p>“It’s so soon.”</p>
   <p>“It is, but we need to get going.” I leaned over onto his shoulder and took a deep breath.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>Back at the hanger everyone was waiting outside. They looked like some kind of black ops strike team. I laughed at the image of us from the orphanage dressed up like swat and preparing to raid some corporate facility.</p>
   <p>I changed in a back room and joined them.</p>
   <p>“Code names, does everyone have one picked out?” Sam took out his phone and opened some kind of recording app.</p>
   <p>“I decided to go with Sear.” I said looking around the room at everyone.</p>
   <p>“Call me Arch.” Ronnie shot a bolt of lightning between his open palms.</p>
   <p>“What do you think about Shift?” Sandy looked for everyone’s approval.</p>
   <p>“All I could think of was Chrono.” Kenny said.</p>
   <p>“I’m going with Blackout.” Rachel said.</p>
   <p>“I’m gonna go with Sear for those of you that aren’t aware.” I said.</p>
   <p>Sam handed me the storage device, “It can take a beating, but it isn’t indestructible. Just get it plugged in.”</p>
   <p>“Easy enough.” I said.</p>
   <p>“I hope so and I wish you luck.” Sam said.</p>

    <p>Chapter 21: Descent</p>
   </title>
   <p>“Where is the plane?” the runway and the taxiway were both empty. We stood outside of the hanger in the dark.</p>
   <p>“Wait for it.” Silence turned as the door began to open slowly. A massive plane rolled out of the darkness almost as quiet as a whisper. I had never seen a plane that looked like it before.</p>
   <p>“What is that?”</p>
   <p>“This is the BF-1007. We call her Big Bertha. This aircraft is one of the remnants of AdvaGen Technologies. She is built for speed, stealth, and the ability to deliver large payloads without ever being seen.” Silence held out his hands, “Isn’t she a beaut?”</p>
   <p>The huge wings unfolded as they were free of the doorway. It taxied forward and turned to line up with the small runway. We all climbed into the plane one at a time and Silence pulled the door closed behind us.</p>
   <p>Seats lined the sides of the interior. I strapped into a seat and said a prayer to myself. The plane quickly picked up speed as it sped down the small runway. My stomach rose into my throat as we lifted into the air. I still didn’t like flying, but was thankful it wasn’t one of the small planes we came into town on.</p>
   <p>“Sam has asked me to return with the plane.” Silence leaned over and whispered in my ear, "A few things that we need to go over before we get to the drop point. Your headsets are always connected, tap on the ear piece twice, say the code name of who you want to speak with, and then talk. Sam’s code name is Acumen.”</p>
   <p>“Good to know.” I nodded.</p>
   <p>“Next when you jump out of the plane hold the antigrav genny to your chest, and press the button. Do not let go and do not remove it from your chest. You will fall. You hit the button when you have twelve hundred feet left to fall.”</p>
   <p>“What’s it like?” Shift asked.</p>
   <p>“What? Landing with antigrav? Like a feather landing on a goose down bed.” he said.</p>
   <p>The pilot came over the comm.-system, "Get ready to jump.”</p>
   <p>Silence stood and we followed. A door in the floor of the plane opened and we all had to take hold of a hand bar above our heads so we wouldn’t get sucked out. Lights from the cities below rushed by in many blurred lines.</p>
   <p>“GO!” Silence yelled.</p>
   <p>I let go of the hand bar. My body was sucked out of the bottom of the plane as if pulled by my chest. The wind slapped past my head, burning my ears. I looked at my watch, the numbers displayed counted how far the ground was away from me.</p>
   <p>They ran down unbelievably fast.</p>
   <p>“As soon as you hit twelve hundred.” Silence chirped in my ear. I turned over to be falling on my back. Silence had jumped from the plane along with the rest of us.</p>
   <p>I tapped on my ear piece and said, "Silence. I thought that you were supposed to go back with the plane?” I had to yell over the whipping winds.</p>
   <p>“You think that I’ll let you go on your own. You have much to learn.” he pressed his arms to his sides and shot past me like a rocket.</p>
   <p>My watch started to make a beeping noise. I was at thirteen hundred and fifty feet. I held the antigrav generator to my chest and kept my eyes on my watch. As soon as it hit the twelve hundred mark I pressed the button.</p>
   <p>I slowed to almost a stop like everyone around me, "How is everyone doing?” I yelled.</p>
   <p>“Doing good.” Arch yelled, everyone else agreed.</p>
   <p>My hand started to get cold. Colder than anything that I had ever felt before. It started to burn my skin. I held on with all of my might but I had to let go.</p>
   <p>I started to free fall, I reached out for the generator, but it had flown out of my reach.</p>
   <p>“GRACE!!” Silence yelled.</p>
   <p>I had no idea what to do. The ground was rushing up so fast. Silence was yelling something but I couldn’t hear. All I could see were his lips moving. I turned back over onto my stomach. I threw my hands and legs out in front of me.</p>
   <p>I concentrated with all of my will power. Flames like a jet engines rocketed from my palms and the bottom of my feet. I slowed almost to a stop, and waited for the others to catch up.</p>
   <p>I angled my way towards Silence.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright?” Silence looked furious.</p>
   <p>“I’m fine.”</p>
   <p>We all slowly approached the ground, touching down without a sound. Silence immediately broke away from the group and disappeared into the trees. I lost track of him quickly in the shadows.</p>
   <p>“What is he doing?” Arch asked.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know.” I thought about going after him.</p>
   <p>I tapped on my ear piece, "Silence. What are you doing, the facility is in the other direction.”</p>
   <p>Ronnie was holding up a holographic map of the area.</p>
   <p>He didn’t answer me. "SILENCE.” I whispered loudly into the headset.</p>
   <p>A few of the longest moments ever passed by and he returned from the trees. He had something in his hands, "Someone tampered with it.” He held up my antigrav generator.</p>
   <p>“How, why?” I asked, "How in the hell did you see where the thing landed?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know who did it. I intend to find out.” His expression scared me, I’ve never seen anyone that mad in my life.</p>
   <p>Someone tried to kill one of us and it was completely random. Anyone of us could have picked up that antigrav generator. Furry flushed through my face as we started to creep through a field low to the ground.</p>
   <p>We came to the fence on the outer perimeter of the facility, "How should we get inside? Getting out was kind of explosive.” Chrono looked over the small map that hovered over his phone.</p>
   <p>Arch took an all in one tool from one of the many pockets on the vest and started to cut a slit in the fence. We all slipped inside, staying quiet, and still low to the ground.</p>
   <p>“There are two entrances. Both equally guarded.” Silence pointed out.</p>
   <p>“Which one is closest to our ultimate goal?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“The one at the back.”</p>
   <p>“Well I vote for that one.” Arch said.</p>
   <p>I noticed that even though he told Sam that he chose his abilities over the gun it was still strapped to his hip.</p>
   <p>We slid along the wall slowly towards the rear of the facility. It was an entrance they used for deliveries. There were two trucks parked with their engines running. I assumed for deliveries the next morning. I didn’t see either driver which led me to believe that they were sleeping in the cabs.</p>
   <p>There were four guards two standing on either side of the entrance. They were different than the soldiers that cornered us after we escaped. These were wearing gas masks with glowing red eyes. They had all black armor that looked like plastic and some kind of rifle that I had never seen before.</p>
   <p>One of the guards had wandered off from the others.</p>
   <p>I looked over to ask Silence something but he was gone. I looked up and he was inches from the guard who had wandered off by himself. He reached up and grabbed the guard waving some kind of device over the guard’s ear. The guard immediately lost consciousness. He drug the body to a nearby wall.</p>
   <p>Arch made his move once two of the remaining guards rounded the wall to investigate. He rushed them and took them out with a single powerful bolt of energy. Shift morphed into one of the guards, we all joined Silence and the three dead bodies at the side of the building.</p>
   <p>Shift joined the last guard at the entrance.</p>
   <p>“What is going on?” the guard asked Shift.</p>
   <p>“Had to take a leak.” She said mimicking the man’s voice perfectly.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to have to report this.” the guard turned to walk away</p>
   <p>“I was afraid of that.” Shift took her chance to hit the guard in the back of the head. The guard stumbled and caught himself on the wall. She put her arm around his head and held him until he stopped struggling. She drug the body to where the others were stacked.</p>
   <p>Chrono held out the storage case, "You should take this from here.”</p>
   <p>I took it from him, and threw the strap over my shoulder. We used a keycard from one of the guard’s bodies to unlock the door. Shift held her guard form, but made the blood vanish from her clothes.</p>
   <p>The hallway inside was quiet.</p>

    <p>Chapter 22: The Core</p>
   </title>
   <p>The lobby inside of the building was eerily cheerful. The walls in the lobby were a sterilized white and the lights were bright and unnatural. Cheerful elevator music played over the intercom system. The receptionist desk was empty.</p>
   <p>“This place gives me the creeps.” I said keeping a close eye on the two doors leading from the deeper parts of the facility into the lobby.</p>
   <p>“Remember this is the lobby for the power plant portion of the facility. This lobby is the public area. Aurora has their image to maintain.” Silence said. He walked over to the desk, and pulled the touch screen computer out of the desk.</p>
   <p>“Why don’t people ask Aurora why they post guards at the entrance of a simple power plant?” Shift asked.</p>
   <p>“I guess most people just don’t care.” Silence mumbled.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” I joined Silence behind the desk.</p>
   <p>“I am going to download all of the fire escape data. With it, we may be able to find our way around the facility.” he plugged a cable into the computer, and then into his phone. The screen flashed the words <emphasis>files located</emphasis> and he pressed his finger to the download button.</p>
   <p>“How do you know you can get it with your phone?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Most of the current Aurora Tech is built upon AdvaGen platforms. We were able to recover a lot of AdvaGen technology in the town.” Silence explained.</p>
   <p>“Is there any way that we could use a terminal in one of the labs to download the information?” Arch asked.</p>
   <p>“The terminals in each lab only have access to the information pertaining to the subjects and projects in that one lab. To get all of the information in the facility we have to back up the core.” Silence said. All of our watches beeped at the same time. I looked down and it said new maps available. I pressed the screen and the map displayed our location.</p>
   <p>I navigated through the maps down to the lowest level, "I’m guessing that this black area at the bottom here is the computer core?” I said.</p>
   <p>“I’d say that would be a good guess.” Silence looked at my watch.</p>
   <p>“There are two elevator banks, each with emergency stairs. It looks like the stairwells stop one floor above the level that the core is on.” I looked down at the map.</p>
   <p>“It would be nice if these nifty little watches would tell us where all the guards are.” Arch played with the settings on his watch.</p>
   <p>“I think that the facility will be relatively unguarded. Aurora is under the impression that we are stretched very thin.” Silence opened the door to the first hallway. "Let’s just go down the closest stairwell.”</p>
   <p>We all entered the hallway and stuck close to the wall. Silence led the way and made sure that he was the forward most person.</p>
   <p>“What about the cameras?” I asked looking at one that had just pointed right at us.</p>
   <p>“You phone projects an electromagnetic field that makes you and everything you touch invisible to electronic recording devices. This includes infrared.” Silence said waving to the camera then flipping the bird.</p>
   <p>“Where did you get these toys?” Arch asked looking at his phone.</p>
   <p>“We either created it from scratch or modified AdvaGen tech same as Aurora.”</p>
   <p>We rounded a corner as one of the guards was making the last leg of his rounds. He was walking away from us and had no idea that we were behind him. Silence pulled a small throwing knife from his boot and threw it into the guards back. Before the knife even made contact, Silence was inches from the guard to catch him as he fell.</p>
   <p>We drug the man into a closet and locked the door.</p>
   <p>We got to the stairwell’s doorway and Shift held up the keycard she had from before. Silence held out his arm and stopped her, "Wait, that guard is supposed to be guarding the gate. If you swipe the card it will raise the alarm.”</p>
   <p>She tossed the card aside, "What then?”</p>
   <p>“This.” He held up his phone.</p>
   <p>“What can the phone not do?” I smiled.</p>
   <p>“I’ll let you know when I figure it out.” He held it up to the panel. A blue light scanned the lock from the top to the bottom. Seemingly random numbers began to flash across the screen.</p>
   <p>I looked down the hallway while the phone was doing its thing to see a man in a janitor’s uniform sweeping the floor. He whistled a catchy tune.</p>
   <p>He stopped and looked up at me smiling. I tapped Silence on the shoulder, but when I looked back he had vanished into thin air.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” he matched my gaze down the hall.</p>
   <p>“Nothing.” I said.</p>
   <p>A holographic key card, similar to the one that Shift had, appeared hovering over Silence’s phone. He grabbed it and swiped it in the reader. The lock popped and then he pushed open the door.</p>
   <p>“Easy as that.” he said showing us into the stairwell. When the door closed and locked behind us we were left in complete darkness.</p>
   <p>“Where is the light switch?” Chrono searched the walls blindly.</p>
   <p>“The lights have sensors, and they cannot see us.” Silence said, "Grace, Ronnie you have the best abilities for light.”</p>
   <p>I set my hands on fire and Ronnie forced bolts of energy to run down his arms. We started to walk down the stairs taking them slowly.</p>
   <p>When we reached the halfway point, the door below us sprung opened and no less than a dozen Saber soldiers rushed into the room. They raised their guns and began firing in our direction.</p>
   <p>Blackout was quick with her shield to stop the bullets.</p>
   <p>“What the hell are these bullets made of? Each one weighs a ton.” her eyes were already starting to bleed.</p>
   <p>I jumped from the landing and fell like a stone to the floor below. When I hit the ground, I sent out a blast of fire in all directions knocking all of the soldiers to the ground.</p>
   <p>The door at the top opened and the soldiers began filing in following the others down the stairs. Blackout had to drop her shield. Arch and Chrono were fighting the other soldiers. Arch was blasting them with bolts of energy and Chrono was slowing the bullet down with time, knocking them out of the air.</p>
   <p>I walked out into the hallway below, a familiar man stood at the end of the hall.</p>
   <p>“Jolt is down here!” I yelled back through the door.</p>
   <p>He stood with his back to a door and his arms crossed. He knew what we had come for and he was here to stop us.</p>
   <p>“Well, well if it isn’t the misfits. Coming for the computer core? Your little telepath should mind her thoughts.” He had a mad grin plastered on his face. He stood alone at his end of the hallway.</p>
   <p>“Just get out of the way.” I yelled.</p>
   <p>Blackout joined us in the hallway, walking slowly, holding her head.</p>
   <p>“Well if it isn’t our little information portal.”</p>
   <p>“What are you talking about?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“Oh don’t worry. You had no idea the link went both ways when the other person was aware of what you are doing.” Jolt cackled.</p>
   <p>“You know what, this guy is mine.” Arch took a step forward in front of the group. He took off running down the hallway towards Jolt as fast as he could. He held out both of his arms and created two balls of energy.</p>
   <p>He threw them at Jolt.</p>
   <p>Jolt caught the energy and combined them into a single charge of energy and threw it back at Arch. He was able to side step the attack. The energy crashed into the floor and blew a large whole into the rooms below.</p>
   <p>Jolt threw another ball of electricity at Arch who was able to grab it while he jumped through the air landing on Jolt’s face. Jolt screamed as the bolts of energy licked his face, burning deep grooves into his flesh.</p>
   <p>Arch jumped up and took a few steps back as Jolt yelled in pain. He pushed himself up into a standing position using bolts of electricity for more leverage. Arch balled his fists waiting for the second round.</p>
   <p>“I have to say. Your power has grown exponentially since last time.” Jolt spat blood onto the floor.</p>
   <p>“Stop talking and fight.” Arch yelled.</p>
   <p>They ran at each other. Bolts of energy carved scorched lines in the walls as they smashed into each other… Every punch, every kick, blasted with pure white bursts of electricity.</p>
   <p>Arch pinned Jolt onto his stomach and held his arm behind his back, "Silence, Sear, go. I will keep him busy as long as I can!”</p>
   <p>We ran past them, ducking the bolts of energy that were destroying the walls around us. When we got to the door, I melted it without thinking twice and pushed the door open.</p>
   <p>Inside of the room was a round hatch. I tried to open it but it was locked, I didn’t want to damage anything below. There was a small panel on the wall beside us. Silence went to work on the lock.</p>
   <p>Jolt and Arch were standing again, both breathing heavily. Arch attacked but Jolt was waiting for it. He placed his palm on Arch’s chest; he gathered all of his remaining energy and blasted Arch with all of it.</p>
   <p>Arch flew across the room and smashed into the wall behind the others. A crater spread out behind him and he fell to the floor. He rolled onto his stomach and coughed.</p>
   <p>“You are still not strong enough to beat me.” Jolt said standing over Arch’s limp body.</p>
   <p>He held his arms up over his head, charging for one last attack. He gathered up every last bit of energy and brought it down. Blackout came between the blast and Arch with a shield. She absorbed the energy, and then funneled it into Arch.</p>
   <p>“No! No! What are you doing?” Jolt said backing away.</p>
   <p>Arch pushed himself up off the floor. He charged a blast and then added the power that Blackout had given him. He slammed it into Jolt’s chest.</p>
   <p>Jolt stood frozen to the spot. His bones were glowing through his skin. He fell to the ground and smoke billowed from his body.</p>
   <p>“I’m alright.” Arch said noticing me looking at him, "Go complete the mission.” he finished falling onto Blackout for support.</p>

    <p>Chapter 23: The Question</p>
   </title>
   <p>“We are about to get some company!” Blackout yelled. She was helping Arch walk back to the door. He was in rough shape.</p>
   <p>Silence grabbed my arm and turned me towards him. "The hatch is open, take the case, and get the job done.”</p>
   <p>I turned and started to climb down the ladder into the room below. Just before I was out of view, I could see Silence kneel down and pick up three rifles from the fallen soldiers.</p>
   <p>The climb took a good ten minutes before I found the floor below. The room inside was tiny; there was only enough room for two people max. I sat down in the single chair and set the case down on the floor beside me.</p>
   <p>There was no keyboard or mouse, only a single screen, microphone, and camera.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Please present for Facial Recognition Authorization.</emphasis>” a pleasant man’s voice said.</p>
   <p> I thought for a moment and wasn’t sure about what to do, but it hit me. I tapped on my head set and said, "Shift.”</p>
   <p>“Yeah.” she said after a short pause. Her voice was distorted, from the many layers of concrete the signal had to pass through.</p>
   <p>“Could you come down here? I need your help.”</p>
   <p>“One second.” she said. I didn’t hear any gunfire.</p>
   <p>She slid down the ladder and landed on the floor with a soft thud. She took a breath and turned to look at me.</p>
   <p>“Do you remember what James Scott looked like?”</p>
   <p>“That holographic guy that was at the orphanage?” she asked her eyes closed trying to remember.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, do you think that you can change into him?”</p>
   <p>“Isn’t that like screaming, ‘hey we’re hacking in!’ or something?” she asked.</p>
   <p>“They know we’re here, who cares.”</p>
   <p>She concentrated. Her face began to ripple and wave, her skin moving around. Her bones popped and crunched as they reshaped. Her face was identical as far as I could remember.</p>
   <p>“What about the voice?” I added.</p>
   <p>“What do you think?” she asked in a perfect imitation of his voice.</p>
   <p>She lowered her face to the camera and held it there. Green lasers began scanning over every inch of her face. Up and down, then left and right. Photos of people that I had never seen before began to flash across the screen, rapid fire.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Welcome back Mr. Scott. As per your personal policy, you are granted full unmonitored access to the entire system.</emphasis>” the computer said.</p>
   <p>“Please grant Jane Doe the same access.” Shift said in James’s voice.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Yes sir. That’s done.</emphasis>” The computer’s voice was so friendly it almost made me sick.</p>
   <p>I opened the case and pulled out the cable. I plugged it into one of the free ports of the front of the wall of a computer.</p>
   <p>“Back up database on the external drive.” I said.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Thank you for the command. I’m sorry for the inconvenience, but going to need four keys ma’am, but of course you know that already. If you could insert those now, we can proceed.</emphasis>” The computer said.</p>
   <p>I tapped my earpiece twice and said, "Acumen. I have access to the computer, and I am about to insert the keys.”</p>
   <p>“Ready when you are.” He said.</p>
   <p>I inserted all of the keys into the side of the computer.</p>
   <p>“Give me a few minutes.” Acumen said.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Ah, thank you sir. The first key has been accepted. If you would please insert the other three?</emphasis>” the computer said as the light on the first key turned from red to green.</p>
   <p>I waited as the lights turned green one at a time. When the last one changed I heard a blast of gunfire from above me. The noise poured down the hatch and echoed in the small room.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>I have wonderful news. The keys have been accepted and your download has begun. It is going to take approximately ten minutes. Is there anything else that I may help you with while you wait?</emphasis>” The computer asked.</p>
   <p>“Display the surveillance from one floor above.” I became desperate to know what was going on above.</p>
   <p>The screen flashed to a view that was set behind where the others were standing. Arch, Blackout, and Silence were all knelt with rifles firing at the soldiers as they filed into the room. Chrono was standing behind them. He had his arms outstretched slowing the time in the doorway so that each enemy that tried to come into the room was moving in slow motion.</p>
   <p>The four of them ripped through the soldiers like they were the dummies on the practice field. They did not waste a single bullet, each one made contact with an enemy soldier.</p>
   <p>I breathed a sigh of relief as an idea hit me.</p>
   <p>“Could you display any information on AdvaGen Technologies and Joseph Madison?” I asked the computer.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Certainly just one moment while I return the requested information.</emphasis>” I watched as the others continued to crush the soldiers above. I was damn proud to watch them protect themselves flawlessly.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Joseph Madison is in stasis where his brain has been tethered to a computer by his own design. AdvaGen Technologies has been completely shut down and all remaining projects have been transferred to the Aurora Corporation Research and Development Technology department.</emphasis>” the computer explained.</p>
   <p>“Joseph Madison, the founder of AdvaGen Technologies is alive?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Yes. James Scott ordered their deaths to be faked with clones and then the real ones put into the Morpheus Project.</emphasis>” the computer said.</p>
   <p>“Who else?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Joseph’s wife Abbitha.</emphasis>”</p>
   <p>“What is the Morpheus Project?” I asked desperate for answers. I had more question then ever.</p>
   <p>“<emphasis>Unable to comply.</emphasis>” the screen went blank.</p>
   <p>“Crap!” I yelled.</p>
   <p>“Did we lose that data?” Shift asked.</p>
   <p>The screen flickered back on and the progress bar reappeared. The transfer hadn’t stopped and we were sitting at ninety-nine percent.</p>
   <p>“We’re still good. Almost done.” I said pulling my hair and sighing.</p>
   <p>When the transfer had completed, I packed everything back into the case. I put the strap over my shoulder and made sure that we had all of the keys.</p>
   <p>“Let’s get the hell out of here.” Shift said.</p>
   <p>We started to climb the ladder her right in front of me. When we got back up onto the upper floor, we could see the true scale of the carnage of what had occurred above.</p>
   <p>Silence and Arch were leaning on the walls and breathing heavily. Blackout was sitting on the ground back against the wall. Chrono was rubbing his head hardly able to remain standing.</p>
   <p>Silence smiled and walked towards me, "It’s about tim…” before he could finish he stopped. He fell to his knees clutching his stomach. He pulled his hand away from his body and blood spilled to the floor. He fell the rest of the way to the ground.</p>
   <p>Behind him a wounded guard was barely holding up a rifle. Blood ran down his face where he had been injured in his head. His sights were lined up on the spot where Silence had been standing.</p>
   <p>I dropped the case as my entire body burst into flame and I shot across the room. I landed on the guard, grabbed him by the neck, and held him up into the air. His body disintegrated in my hand from the massive flames that were flowing from my arm.</p>
   <p>“GET OUT OF HERE!” I yelled. My voice sounded like there were several voices on top of mine.</p>
   <p>Shift picked up the case while Chrono and Arch picked up Silence to carry him out of the building.</p>
   <p>Once everyone had left the room I filled it with flames. I burned everything around me so hot that the concrete crumbled under the weight of the building above. The ceiling above me burst into dust as I rose. I gave the others time to get out of the building.</p>
   <p>When I was outside I hung in the sky above the facility. I fed flames into the building below creating more and more heat. I watched as everything crumbled into ash. I wanted to make this spot impossible to ever rebuild on in the future. I poured on every single ounce of power that I could find.</p>
   <p>When there was nothing left but a single solid piece of smoking concrete and steel, I lowered myself to where the others were hunched around Silence.</p>
   <p>Shift met me behind one of the trucks that were parked. She morphed back into herself, clothes and all. She opened the trucks door and politely asked for any clothes that he had in his truck. The driver gave her a shirt and some shorts. Again I was forced to dress in men’s clothes.</p>
   <p>Ronnie coughed loudly holding the wound while blood poured out.</p>
   <p>“Ryder, Ryder, can you hear me?” My voice shook with fear as I scooped him into my arms. His body was limp and heavy.</p>
   <p>“Loud and clear…” he coughed.</p>
   <p>I tapped my head set, "Sam… I mean Acumen.”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead.” he said.</p>
   <p>“Ryder has been badly injured. I know that Vanish is still recovering, but we need her to come and get Ryder. I don’t think that he is going to make it otherwise.” I said hysterically.</p>
   <p>“Hold on.” he said, the line going dead.</p>
   <p>The air around us was quiet. I could hear Shift sobbing into Chrono’s shoulder, and I dare not look at any of them. Silence coughed loudly as I rocked back and forth waiting for something to happen.</p>
   <p>Vanish appeared and put her hand on Silence. She waited for me to let go. I kissed him and backed away. The two of them blinked away in the bright blue light. Knowing that she had come did help, but not as much as I had hoped. She’d already had blood seeping from her eyes before they had left.</p>

    <p>Chapter 24: Opaque</p>
   </title>
   <p>I took a second to clear my head. I had to assume that Silence was safe, but we still had to get to the helicopter that was our way home. We were all tired and Arch could not walk on his own and was leaning on Chrono</p>
   <p>“Nobody gets left behind. Period. If you need help you speak up.” I brought up the map of the area on my watch. I took a good look at our surroundings, but it was difficult at night to determine where to go. Sharp pains in the back of my head weren’t helping anything.</p>
   <p>“Where do we go?” Shift asked looking over my shoulder at the map.</p>
   <p>I tapped my headset twice, "Acumen.”</p>
   <p>“Go ahead.” he said.</p>
   <p>“Is there any way we can make figuring out where to go easier?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Turn the dial on the watch to the C. It will point you in the direction of your ultimate destination using a GPS connection. You will have to find your way around any obstacles.” Acumen said.</p>
   <p>I did as he said. The map vanished and a small arrow appeared on the screen of the watch.</p>
   <p>I took a deep breath, "Are we ready?”</p>
   <p>Everyone gave their nod in ready. Chrono got a good grip on Arch and we followed the arrow into the trees.</p>
   <p>“I don’t think it’ll be long before we have company.” Blackout said.</p>
   <p>“We keep moving and maybe we can avoid them altogether.” We maneuvered slowly through the trees. I looked down at my watch, under the arrow it read <emphasis>.98M </emphasis>which I assumed M was for miles, "I think we have about a mile.”</p>
   <p>We exited the woods and waited at the edge of a four lane highway. We waited for a good enough break in the cars and in pairs we bolted across the road. When we got to the other side, we slid down into the ditch and took a breather.</p>
   <p>“How do you feel?” I asked Arch who was sitting at the bottom of the ditch.</p>
   <p>“Like I was hit by a bus.” he said. Blood was smeared across his face from him trying to wipe it off. "I think that I can walk now.”</p>
   <p>I watched the clock closely and when five minutes was up, I got everyone up. "Let’s get back.” I said. I felt personally responsible for the whole group and I was desperate for any information telling me that Ryder was going to be alright.</p>
   <p>We crossed a small field and cut a gap in a chain link fence that led into a small subdivision. The houses were all dark and there were hardly any cars in the driveways.</p>
   <p>“There it is.” I said as we hit the top of a hill. I could see the helicopter sitting on the pad waiting for us. The pilot was walking around the front, checking the craft over.</p>
   <p>“Let’s go home.” Arch said, trying to keep his balance.</p>
   <p>I heard a loud pitch whistle coming from behind where we stood. I turned around to see a black streak tear across the sky. It smashed into the helicopter and exploded, sending us all flying from the shockwave.</p>
   <p>I forced myself to my feet, but the helicopter, the pad, and the building had all been destroyed. I searched the sky behind us for any kind of aircraft, but I couldn’t see anything.</p>
   <p>“Acumen. The helicopter is gone.” I said into my headset.</p>
   <p>“What do you mean?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“Gone, exploded, big freaking boom.” I yelled. My brain was going a hundred miles a minute.</p>
   <p>“Calm down.”</p>
   <p>“Calm down? The pilot is dead!” I yelled.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. Bertha is ten miles north of you. They are refueling. I am updating your system now.” he said his voice panicked.</p>
   <p>“Ten miles?” Arch said. The whole group, including myself, was exhausted. Walking that kind of distance was simply not an option.</p>
   <p>“Stay here, Shift you come with me. We are going to get a truck.” I said.</p>
   <p>We went back out to the road.</p>
   <p>“What are you going to do?” Shift asked as we both knelt down by the road.</p>
   <p>“Something crazy.” I said.</p>
   <p>I walked out into the middle of the road as an SUV came barreling towards me at seventy plus miles per hour. I held out my hand. The truck came to a screeching stop inches from where I stood.</p>
   <p>I walked over to the driver’s door.</p>
   <p>“Are you out of your mind? I could have killed you!” the man in the driver’s seat said through an open window.</p>
   <p>“I need your car.” I said lighting my eyes on fire.</p>
   <p>The driver jumped out of the car and took off running down the street. I could make out him screaming something about a demon.</p>
   <p>I stopped the truck next to where the others had gathered. They all climbed up the ditch and into the truck. I took my cell phone out of my pocket and opened a GPS app. I checked the map for the coordinates to where Bertha was located and entered it the truck’s GPS.</p>
   <p><emphasis>”Make a u-turn whenever possible.” </emphasis>the GPS said.</p>
   <p>I put the truck into drive and smashed on the gas. I cut through the median and followed the directions given by the GPS. I swerved in and out of traffic, greatly exceeding the speed limit. Every time the traffic would build up I would go off the road around the cars.</p>
   <p>We came to a small airstrip as the familiar plane was taxing to the end of the runway. The side door was open. I drove the truck right up to where the plane was sitting and parked next to the opened door.</p>
   <p>“There was some kind of aircraft or something following us. I don’t know if we lost it or not.” I told the pilot. He was standing outside of the door waiting on us.</p>
   <p>“My name is Opaque.” he said. He reached up and placed his hand on the plane’s hull. He closed his eyes and the entire plane vanished along with everything inside it, "I’ve got this covered.”</p>
   <p>I sighed in relief, finally some good news. We all got into the plane and took our seats.</p>
   <p>I strapped my harness over my chest and pulled the straps tight with a little too much anger. I looked at everyone. They were tired, hurt, and dirty.</p>
   <p>“He is going to be alright.” Arch said sitting down next to me. Blackout rested her head on Arch’s shoulder.</p>
   <p>“How are you so sure, he could barely breathe.” I said worried about what we might come home to, "Besides that, Vanish wasn’t looking so good when she appeared.”</p>
   <p>“Don’t worry.”</p>
   <p>“Thanks.”</p>
   <p>The engines fired up and revved to full power. I could feel the plane begin to move down the runway. The nose lifted, and my stomach shifted as we gained altitude.</p>
   <p>I laid my head back and closed my eyes. Everything raced through my head, I knew I had to find my parents and help them, but I wanted to know why Aurora was working so hard to keep them alive, and why they had him attached to a computer.</p>
   <p>“So is this information going to be worth everything that we just went through to get it?” Chrono asked from across the plane.</p>
   <p>“The information that I got from just talking to the computer was worth almost everything that we had to do, but nothing is worth what happened to Silence.” I said.</p>
   <p>“And what did you get?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“My parents…”</p>
   <p>“What about them?” he asked.</p>
   <p>“They are both alive and Aurora has them.” I said.</p>

    <p>Chapter 25: Gone</p>
   </title>
   <p>Opaque landed the plane gently and taxied into the safety of the hanger. There was a truck waiting to pick up everyone and take us to the clinic. Sam waited for us in the lobby. He had a look of white hot anger on his face.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z was waiting for me; his assistant took care of the others. He took me to the exam room that I had been to before.</p>
   <p>“How is Silence?” I asked as he began to check my vitals.</p>
   <p>“Let’s finish this first.” he said with a stern look on his face. He brought out the brain scanner and placed it on my head. He recorded the new data.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“I am taking scans. I’m aware of what happened while you were on the mission.” he said, "Use your abilities.”</p>
   <p>I held out my hand and created a small ball of flame that hovered a few inches from my palm. I watched the screen. The normal lines appeared on the chart and no signs of the mental block. It was as if it never existed.</p>
   <p>“Everything seems to check out. Some bumps and bruises, nothing more, and it looks like your abilities have been returned to normal.” he said.</p>
   <p>“Great, I’m fine. Now, take me to Sam.” I said loudly.</p>
   <p>He sighed, "Alright come on.”</p>
   <p>I left the exam room and returned to the clinic’s lobby. Sam stood looking out of the window.</p>
   <p>“Where is Ryder?” I asked eager to see him. Sam didn’t take his eyes away from the window as I spoke.</p>
   <p>“I hoped that he was going to come back with you. I had hoped that Vanish was too bad off to make the return trip and they were on that plane with you.” he said putting his hands on the back of his head.</p>
   <p>“Well he didn’t, he disappeared with Vanish.” I said. I screamed in my head at the building frustration.</p>
   <p>“They are not here. They haven’t returned.” He said looking at the ground.</p>
   <p>“What do we do now?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know what to do.”</p>
   <p>I didn’t even respond. I had no idea what to say to him.</p>
   <p>I turned and left the clinic.</p>
   <p>Our house was empty and dark. If I moved quickly I could pack my things and leave before anyone tried to stop me. I walked up to my room and grabbed a bag. I began to stuff clothes into it without paying any attention to what items I was taking hold of, fury clouded my vision.</p>
   <p>I took the stairs down to the first floor two at a time but I wasn’t fast enough. Ronnie stood in my path of the door.</p>
   <p>“Where are you going?”</p>
   <p>“I’m leaving.” I said shoving him out of my path, which even with enhanced strength, was a difficult task.</p>
   <p>“Grace, why are you leaving?” He demanded following me out onto the front lawn.</p>
   <p>“Because someone has to do something and I’m not going to sit around and do nothing while there are so many unknowns.” I yelled over my shoulder.</p>
   <p>I ran to where Ryder had parked his car. He’d left the keys in the center console and I didn’t think he would object to me borrowing it for now.</p>
   <p>Sam’s truck was parked at the town’s entrance, but I blew past it like it wasn’t even there. I flew down the road at eighty miles per hour before slamming on the brakes outside of the road leading to my father’s house.</p>
   <p>I parked the car and slammed the door with so much heat that the window shattered. I was thinking about finally finding people that I fit in with and that particular life is so messed up.</p>
   <p>The front door to the house opened automatically as I approached it, sliding almost silently into the thick wall. Alrick was waiting inside as well as a woman that I hadn’t met and assumed was Alice.</p>
   <p>“Who is this?” I asked in an angry tone.</p>
   <p>“This is number four, your father called her Alice.” he said cheerfully.</p>
   <p>“The doctor?”</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am.” Alrick said.</p>
   <p>“What did I tell you about that?” I snapped at Alrick.</p>
   <p>“Sorry…Grace.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll be in the office. No calls.”</p>
   <p>“No calls?” He asked, "I don’t think that anyone will be calling you here.” he said bewildered.</p>
   <p>“Just don’t disturb me.” I walked away from them.</p>
   <p>“She is like her father.” Alice said quietly as they turned to walk in the other direction.</p>
   <p>I opened the door to the office. The lights came on as I walked into the room. It was clean but I could feel how used the room was. In fact the way the room felt, I thought that the only reason that Alrick was able to clean it was because my father was gone.</p>
   <p>I walked past a shelf on the wall that held several pictures in frames of silver. My father and mother where standing around a plane. I picked up the picture and read some writing in the bottom left hand corner; <emphasis>BF-1030 Joseph and Abby Madison. </emphasis></p>
   <p>I put it down, walked to the desk, and sat down in my father’s chair, and swiveled to look out of the window. The sun was coming up behind the mountain. I laid my head back and closed my eyes. It was peaceful. I could see the mountain and the entire lake from this one chair.</p>
   <p>I went through my father’s desk looking for some kind of journal or notes of any kind, but I found nothing. I tried to get onto his computer, but it was very thoroughly locked. My head was killing me and with each passing moment the pain got worse. I grabbed my head, laid it down on the desk.</p>
   <p>It felt like I was crying. I wiped the tears but they were blood. I found something and wiped my face clean, and pushed through the pain. I stood up and walked over to the window.</p>
   <p>I fell to my knees.</p>
   <p>Darkness swallowed the room.</p>
   <p>I didn’t feel myself collapsing to the floor.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I felt myself being lifted off the ground. I didn’t stay conscious long enough to know where I was taken.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>There was a knock on the door.</p>
   <p>“Yeah!” I yelled trying to keep both of my feet under the covers.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry to bother you.” Alrick said walking into the room.</p>
   <p>“It’s alright, Alrick.” I said pushing myself up onto my hands.</p>
   <p>“I have just a few things this morning. Your friend Ronnie stopped by this morning and requested to see you but I sent him away. I told him to come back once you have had a chance to get some real rest.” he said.</p>
   <p>My heart skipped a beat at the possibility that there may be news about Ryder. “Any news?” I asked. I started to get out of the bed, but the pain was unbelievable.</p>
   <p>“He told me to let you know that there was no more information on Silence, or Vanish’s whereabouts, and Alice would like you to come up and see her today.”</p>
   <p>“Is there anything else?” I asked rubbing my eyes.</p>
   <p>“No, let me know if you need anything.” He said looking around the room.</p>
   <p>“I will. Thank you for everything.” I said wearily. I felt like I could use more sleep just getting out of bed.</p>
   <p>“You do not need to thank me. You and your family are my family.” he said.</p>
   <p>Alrick turned and walked out of the room with a concerned look on his face.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“How do you feel?” Alice asked passing a scanner over my body focusing on the areas with the worst injuries.</p>
   <p>“The pain is not as bad.” I said, “But still pretty unbearable.”</p>
   <p>That’s good to hear. I will be monitoring your brain scans. There are a few things that are out of the ordinary that I have never seen before. Nothing to be worried about I’m sure, but I want to be ready for anything.” she explained.</p>
   <p>“Alright, so can I get out of here? No offence, but I don’t like doctor’s offices or any place that is similar.” I said getting down gently from the table.</p>
   <p>“Yeah, just take it easy for a while.” She said switching off the scanner and putting it in her pocket.</p>

    <p>Chapter 26: Chuck</p>
   </title>
   <p>I stood in my father’s office with my arms crossed, chewing on my thumbnail. I had my phone on its loudest setting lying on the desk beside me. I couldn’t take my eyes from the screen no matter how hard I tried.</p>
   <p>I wanted it to ring more than anything. I wanted Sam to tell me that Ryder and Vanish had reappeared and they were unharmed. I knew that call wasn’t going to come; something inside told me it would be very difficult to locate them.</p>
   <p>There was a knock at the door and a throat clear. I looked up to see Alrick standing in the doorway.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry if I’ve disturbed you ma’am.” He said with a soft smile.</p>
   <p>“No, you’re fine.” I said pressing the button on the side of the phone that woke the screen. I checked to see if I had missed anything, but I hadn’t. “Do you know how to unlock the computer?” I asked pointing to the main computer screen on the desk. There was no keyboard or mouse.</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am. Everything is voice controlled.” He explained, “Your father left a password for you and your sister that will unlock the computer main frame. It will make you the primary user.”</p>
   <p>“What is the password?” I asked sitting down in front of the screen.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know. Your father told me that you would know the password when you returned.”</p>
   <p>“You have got to be kidding me.” I said leaning back in the chair.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. Your father said that you and your sister were the only ones to have access to the database.” He turned to walk away but stopped and looked at me, “Alice asked me to have you go and visit her in her lab. She would like to take a few more scans.” He walked away in silence before I could say anything.</p>
   <p>I rotated in the chair mindlessly and sighed. I had no clue what the password could have been. I looked around the room trying to think of anything from my past but I couldn’t remember anything from before I was about ten years old. What I had learned so far about my father helped none when trying to figure out a password.</p>
   <p>Nothing came to mind.</p>
   <p>I stood, picked up my phone, checked it one more time, and put it in my pocket. I left the room. The door closed behind me and the bolts locked into the wall. The house was built like a fortress. I wondered if my father was paranoid.</p>
   <p>I roamed the halls trying to decide where I should go and getting an idea for the layout of the massive house. I wanted to find Ryder but I had no idea where to start looking. I had nothing that I could offer at this point to The Last Line besides setting things on fire.</p>
   <p>I found my way into the kitchen where the android named Chuck was standing with the fridge door open staring inside.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” I asked as I entered the room.</p>
   <p>He jumped and slammed the door shut. He stumbled backward, stammering but had no words.</p>
   <p>“Whoa big guy calm down.” I said holding out my hands. It surprised me to see a robot jump like a startled child.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry ma’am.” He said looking down.</p>
   <p>“I wish you would all stop calling me Ma’am.” I said rubbing my head. “I was just wondering why you were looking in the fridge.” I smiled.</p>
   <p>“I like to look at food. I wish that I could eat it, but it’s a no go.” He shrugged.</p>
   <p>I shook my head, “So, what do you party animals do for fun around here?” I put my hands in my pockets and rolled on the balls of my heels.</p>
   <p>“I haven’t been able to completely grasp the concept of fun, but what I do in my spare time gives me a feeling of completion.” Chuck said emulating my behavior, putting his hands in his pockets then rolling the same way that I had.</p>
   <p>“Well what is it you do to arrive at this feeling of completion?” I asked feeling as though I were being examined by an ape at the zoo.</p>
   <p>“I work on your father’s vast collection of vehicles.” He said, a smile spread across his face, and he ceased the emulation.</p>
   <p>“How many does he have?” I asked noting his excitement.</p>
   <p>“Well he only has about thirty here, but in other garages around the country the numbers could be in the thousands. I haven’t seen them all and I am afraid that in your father’s absence, the vehicles are sure to have fallen into disrepair.” He explained, “Would you like to see?” he asked holding his hand out towards the way that I had come.</p>
   <p>“Sure, why not?” I walked off in that direction.</p>
   <p>I followed behind Chuck as we walked towards the front of the house but as we passed the front door he didn’t stop. We walked down the hall towards the left wing of the house where the labs and office was located. We came to the end of the hall where it appeared that the hall stopped at a dead-end. Chuck reached out and placed his hand on a seemingly random spot on the wall.</p>
   <p>“What are you doing?” I asked but before he said anything, a blue laser scanned his hand. The wall morphed into a clear liquid and waved at his touch.</p>
   <p>“It’s perfectly safe. Your father had a great many inventions that he was not able to get out of this house. On a daily basis he would come up with something new. He would not only design the contraptions, but he wouldn’t stop until he found a way to make whatever he envisioned work flawlessly.” Chuck explained walking through the clear liquid.</p>
   <p>I hesitated for a second but gritted my teeth and pushed through. It was like walking through a warm breeze. It felt good making me smile.</p>
   <p>“This gateway uses nano robotic technology and a chemical to create not only the illusion of a door, but the physical sensation that it is actually there.” Chuck explained as he turned to continue down the hallway. The floor fell at a slight decline into an underground thru-way.</p>
   <p>We exited the thru-way into a garage that was lined like a packed parking lot with all different types of vehicles that I had never seen before. The wall behind us closed, solidifying into concrete and stone. I turned and rubbed my hand on the wall feeling the contours under my palm.</p>
   <p>“Wonderful isn’t it?” Chuck asked.</p>
   <p>“My father built this himself?” I asked, “He didn’t have someone else do the work?”</p>
   <p>“Oh no, your father was only happy when he had his hands dirty. He would design as he built, and build as he designed, making adjustments, and corrections on the spot.” He seemed sad.</p>
   <p>“Where did all of these cars come from?” I asked turning from the wall.</p>
   <p> “Your father and I worked together to build them. I tried to build one after he left, but without him here to give me design ideas, all that I can do is make exact copies of the ones that we had already built.</p>
   <p>“Why are there so many different kinds?” I asked walking up to a four door sedan and pulling on the door handle. It was locked.</p>
   <p>Chuck waved his hand and the doors unlocked.</p>
   <p>“That’s a cool trick.” I said opening the door. I slid into the driver’s seat.</p>
   <p>“I have a bluetooth transmitter in my head.” He said pointing to the base of his skull.</p>
   <p>“Back to my question.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Your father was trying to do away with the world’s dependence on Fossil fuels. He designed a new power cell that these vehicles use. The fuel in the cell, some element that he discovered, can power these vehicles for one hundred thousand miles.” He said.</p>
   <p>“Holy crap, that’s a lot. What is the element?” I asked pulling the hood release.</p>
   <p>“I don’t know, he assembled the power cells elsewhere. We just built the cars. We spent a great deal of time down here working.” Chuck explained pointing to a cylindrical device where the engine would normally be.</p>
   <p>“How does it work?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“You would have to ask your father. He is the mastermind.” He explained.</p>
   <p>“This is amazing.” I said, “But why aren’t there any of these on the road? This could solve so many of the ‘oil shortage’ problems. I mean you could power more than just cars, what about space travel?” I said excited with the possibilities.</p>
   <p>“The Aurora Corporation.” He said slamming the hood shut and walking away. The acquisition my father’s company was obviously a sour spot for him.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” I asked following him.</p>
   <p>“When they took over your father’s company they shut down all projects and pulled everything off of the market. It was some kind of punishment to your father’s memory. After six months, they rebranded tried and true money makers and rereleased them.” He explained.</p>

    <p>Chapter 27: Possibility</p>
   </title>
   <p>I went around the outside of the house still wishing to become more familiar with the grounds. There was a beautiful forest pathway and fountain. There was a court yard but I didn’t go out to it because I didn’t want to get lost. I left Chuck with the cars. He seemed a bit wound up about the mention of my father. It was hard to imagine that I would ever be able to handle robots with emotions.</p>
   <p>I made my way up to the second level of the house and to Alice’s office. I wondered why she needed to take more scans after only a few days. My headaches were becoming farther apart, and less intense.</p>
   <p>I checked unmarked doors as I walked down the hallway on the right side of the second floor before coming to Alice’s office. Every door until her office was an identical bedroom each fully equipped with its own bathroom.</p>
   <p>I walked into her office which was quite large. There were three hospital beds across the back wall and several different diagnosis tools littered the room including a large cat scanner. There was another room, in the back with a large window and an open door. Alice sat behind her desk in the room engrossed in her computer screen with her back to the window.</p>
   <p>I walked over to the window and knocked, “Alice.” I said trying to pull her attention away from the computer.</p>
   <p>“Ah, Grace!” She got up and closed the program window.</p>
   <p>“Alrick told me that you wanted me to come up for a few more scans.” I said putting my hands in my pockets.</p>
   <p>“If you are willing, I would like to do a few scans of your brain. I was keeping weekly scans of your parents before they were killed.” She said starting to collect a number of tools from her office.</p>
   <p>“I had a few scans taken while I was with The Last Line. How are you going to take the scans? Doctor Z had a device that they had stolen from Aurora and modified on their own.” I asked.</p>
   <p>“I have one that was built by AdvaGen. Designed by a woman named Dalia Alon who’s began to work for Aurora after they acquired your father’s company.” She explained.</p>
   <p>“I see.” I said, “I guess that I am alright with you taking a few scans.”</p>
   <p>“Excellent.” She said pulling a chair from her office, “Please, sit.”</p>
   <p>I did as I was instructed. Alice rolled next to where I sat. She placed all of her tools down on a table and then she returned to her office. She returned with a metal case that she placed on the table. She opened the locks and removed the device.</p>
   <p>She placed the device it on my head then removed a tablet computer from the case.</p>
   <p>“Alright, I am going to ask a series of control questions.”</p>
   <p>I nodded slightly, but the device was much heavier than the one that Doctor Z had used.</p>
   <p>“First question; what is the nature of your ability?”</p>
   <p>“I have the ability to manipulate fire and heat. The people at Aurora called my ability Pyrokinetics.”</p>
   <p>“Second question; how long have you been able to use your ability or when did you obtain your ability.”</p>
   <p>“I have been able to use my abilities for around three months, give or take.”</p>
   <p>“Have you had any pain directly associated with the use of your abilities?”</p>
   <p>“Sometimes when I use my abilities for extended periods of time, I tend to have head pain.”</p>
   <p>“Alright, now that I have neutral scans, please use your abilities.”</p>
   <p>I held out my hand, conjured a small ball of flame to hover a few inches from my palm. I slowly changed the magnitude of the flame by progressing from the cool yellow flames to the ridiculous heat of the white flames.</p>
   <p>When she was satisfied with the results of the scans she turned the heavy device off and removed it from my head. I was exhausted and my neck was killing me.</p>
   <p>“Alright I think that will be all that I need to begin constructing a file on your normal brainwave activity.” She smiled.</p>
   <p>I turned to leave the office rubbing my sore neck but stopped and thought for a moment. I turned to ask Alice a question.</p>
   <p>“My father left instructions with Alrick to access the computer system. He said that I would know the password, that I would be able to remember it, but honestly I don’t have a clue. I was wondering if there was any device lying around that would help me navigate my memories. Things are a little jumbled up in my head because they gave me a drug a short time ago to take down any mental blocks that I had developed over the years.” I explained.</p>
   <p>“The only device that I know of that could allow you to navigate your memories requires access to your father’s mainframe, and if you had access to that you wouldn’t have the problem in the first place.”</p>
   <p>“Oh well, I guess that it was worth a shot.” I shrugged and turned again to leave.</p>
   <p>“There is a less scientific way but it could be very dangerous.” She said turning to her office and opened up a program on her computer.</p>
   <p>“And what would that be?” I asked, going to the doorway and trying to watch what she was doing on the computer screens. The different windows were moving far too fast for my eyes to be able to follow.</p>
   <p>“We can put you into a coma.”</p>
   <p>“And what? Hope for the best?”</p>
   <p>“No, no. I can tune the kinetic brain wave inducer to stimulate the parts of your brain that are responsible for memories.” She explained.</p>
   <p>“How well will it work?” I asked worried about some of the memories that I had already relived on my own.</p>
   <p>“About a fifty-fifty shot.” She began to blaze through equations at lightening speeds.</p>
   <p>“Well, I guess that we can give it a shot.” I left her in her office.</p>
   <p>I walked back down the hall the way I came. I went back to the room that I had awakened in that morning. I went into the bathroom and cleaned up before going to bed.</p>
   <p>The bed was huge and extremely comfortable, but it still took me a few minutes to get to sleep. My mind didn’t want to slow down.</p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 28: Sister</p>
   </title>
   <p>I fought to stay asleep for at least eight hours. I hadn’t had steady sleep in as far back as I could remember. I was getting plenty of it, but most of the time it was an exhaustion fueled mini coma. I got up a few times in the night to wash my face with cold water and turn the air in the room down. Each room had self contained environmental controls.</p>
   <p>I turned on the TV and flipped through the channels. There was nothing on that I wanted to watch. I passed a documentary on the Aurora Corporation and the good that they were doing all over the world. The entire media universe spent millions or more on building Aurora up to some kind of Godsend.</p>
   <p>When the sun was pushing its way into the room, I decided that I would shower and then visit Alice hoping that she was ready to get on with this experiment.</p>
   <p>I met Alrick in the hallway when I left my room.</p>
   <p>“How is it that you are always right there when I get out and about?” I walked past him down the hall.</p>
   <p>“I monitor your sleep patterns and the whole house is set up with motion tracking.”</p>
   <p>“Sorry I asked.” I laughed.</p>
   <p>“Do you require anything?”</p>
   <p>“No thank you. I’m going to see Alice.”</p>
   <p>He nodded and walked the other way.</p>
   <p>I knocked on Alice’s office door this time instead of just busting into the room.</p>
   <p>“Come on in.” she said muffled.</p>
   <p>I couldn’t see Alice when I entered the room but I immediately noticed a new machine in the center of the room. It stretched from the floor to the ceiling with a chair suspended in the center of a large metal ring. I looked in the office and checked the supply closets at the back, but Alice was nowhere to be found.</p>
   <p>“Down here.” She called from under the new machine. I looked to see an access panel in the floor below where bundles of wires as thick as my arm were running up into the bottom of the chair. Alice’s face was covered in grease.</p>
   <p>“What’s up?” I knelt next to the access panel in the floor.</p>
   <p>“I’m almost ready.” She pulled herself back up into the room. “I had to get some equipment out of storage but this configuration should allow me to successfully stimulate the memory portion of your brain.” She explained. She walked over to her desk and picked up a tablet computer. She showed me a design of three different machines that were wired together. It was a massive extrapolation on the word Jerry-rig.</p>
   <p>“Is it safe?” I looked down in the hole. A metal cylinder about the size of my torso pulsated with blue lights like a slow heart beat.</p>
   <p>“I could run some simulations.” She said looking down at her tablet.</p>
   <p>“No, no let’s just get this over with.” I was torn between not wanting to wait and not wanting to know the truth of the danger.</p>
   <p>“Ok then, let’s get started.” She cleared her tools off of the chair and motioned for me to sit.</p>
   <p>I sat down and tried to think about anything but the fact that this device might fry my brain. Alice reached up and flipped a switch above my head. A small ring lowered over my head and began to rotate.</p>
   <p>Bolts of energy began arching from the ring to my head but there wasn’t any pain. “The ring will support your head once you have lost consciousness.” Alice walked around the machine and checking things off on a digital check list.</p>
   <p>“Noted.” I took a deep breath.</p>
   <p>She retrieved a syringe and a small vial from a nearby table. She filled the needle and slid up my sleeve. “This will take just a few minutes to kick in. You need to keep your mind on finding what you are looking for; it may be difficult to determine if you have fallen asleep or not.” She found a vein, stuck the needle in, and emptied the concoction into my blood stream.</p>
   <p>I gave her a thumbs up when she pulled out the needle and stepped back, “I hope this works.”</p>
   <p>“There is a very good chance it will work.” She pressed a button on her tablet. The large metal ring around the chair began to spin around me slowly at first, but faster, and then faster.</p>
   <p>I watched the ring as long as I could but I started to feel sick to my stomach so I closed my eyes.</p>
   <p>Moments passed and I wondered when things would start to happen or when I could just open my eyes without having to see the spinning.</p>
   <p>I decided that it wasn’t going to work and the drug that Alice had given had not been strong enough.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p><emphasis>When I opened my eyes I was in another world. Everything around me was completely destroyed. Fires burned around me in all directions. The large ring was still spinning but a section was missing. It had begun to slow and then finally it stopped.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I pulled the small ring from my head and climbed out of the chair. I took a look around the ruins and walked slowly through the halls. I obviously wasn’t remembering something because last I had checked I had not experienced the apocalypse. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I sat down on a crumbling wall and picked up a handful of ash. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“This isn’t going to help me.” I said to no one in particular. My voice echoed around me in all directions. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>A girl peeked at me from behind a wall. I didn’t know the girl off the top of my head but she seemed somehow familiar.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Hey, little girl!” I yelled jumping up and running after her.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I chased her through the maze of the building that didn’t resemble the house at all. I tried to keep up with her, but she was so fast that I started to lose her even as I called out for her.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I stumbled and tripped on the charred bricks on the ground. I fell throwing my arms out in front of me, but I didn’t hit that ground. I went through it and flipped over onto my back, making contact with a wooden floor.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Son of a bitch.” I said standing and rubbing the back of my head.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“You shouldn’t say things like that.” A man said behind me.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I’m sorry…” I said turning but I realized that the man wasn’t talking to me. He was knelt down beside a young girl. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The man was my father.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“But daddy I don’t want a sister!” the girl said stomping her foot.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Baby doll I know we all wanted a little brother, but we should be happy that we are getting a little sister.” He said tussling her hair.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The little girl was me.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>My father stood. We all walked into the room. My mother, who was very pregnant, was sitting next to a fireplace. She had been crying.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Now go and apologize to your mother.” My father said patting the little me on the shoulder.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I walked around and sat on the floor to watch the scene. The younger me hung her head and walked up to our mother. She stood next to our mother trying not to look her in the eyes.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I’m sorry for what I said, mommy. I hope I have fun with my new sister.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Thank you dear.” Our mom said leaning down and giving the younger me a hug, she sniffled, and wiped her eyes.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I couldn’t help but wonder why I was remembering all of this and not something that could be useful.</emphasis></p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 29: Isabella</p>
   </title>
   <p><emphasis>The dream seemed to have frozen around me. My mother, father, and the young me remained completely still. I stood from the floor and walked out of the room. Down the hall I came to a staircase that led into the main sitting room. As I took the steps one at a time, the walls aged and faded before my eyes. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Outside of a nearby window I could see snow falling in sheets and I could hear a fire roaring nearby. I followed the noise into the living room. My mother and father sat on a couch across from a young man that seemed somewhat familiar.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Joseph, I think that you are making a bad decision. Your father and my father have been doing business for forty years and their fathers forty years before that. Why are you ending the partnership between our companies?” The young man said with an angry smile on his face that was obviously forced.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“The Scott family has gone downhill from the time that your father took over Aurora. Your projects are getting closer and closer to the lines that I will not cross and you wonder why I want to end our partnership James?” My father said standing. He began to pace around the room. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Despite your obvious slant on my family name that can be forgiven, I have no idea what projects you are worried about.” James leaned back in his chair.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>My mother kept out of the conversation but I could see she was disgusted just being in the same room with James.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Don’t play games with me James. I have taps on your data network, the same as you have on mine, and I have been monitoring all of your progress. I am terrified to think what you plan to accomplish with these things that you are creating.” My father said.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>James stood, and sighed deeply, “I’m sorry that you feel this way. You know that this is bigger than both of us, and those above us… They want things done a certain way.”</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I think you should leave.” My mother said finally speaking up.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>James took a few steps towards my father, and stopped close to his face challenging him. The two men were exactly the same height. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Sooner rather than later I will control your company. I will do anything that it takes.” James almost growled.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Over my dead body.” My father growled back.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>A noise near the stair caught everyone’s attention. We all turned the see the younger me at the bottom of the stairs watching what was happening.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Isabella get your sister and get into bed.” My father said pointing up stairs.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The little me looked confused, much like I did when my father said the wrong name, but she walked away.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Such a beautiful daughter, it would be a shame if she fell into the hands of the terrible Aurora Corporation.” James said turning to the front door. I heard the slam of the door.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I followed behind the younger me up the stairs back to the second floor of the house. I stumbled over a dead man’s body in the hallway and prayed that I was in a new memory. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I knelt down and looked at the man’s body. It was no one that I knew, some random Aurora soldier wearing armor that I hadn’t seen yet a familiar patch on his shoulder gave him away. Two men turned the corner; my father and another man that looked strange. His skin was a light grey color and most of his features were smooth to the point that they looked unnatural.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“I caught him trying to move through the shadows silently. There was a point zero, zero one noise variance. Unfortunately father, I was forced the kill him.” The weird looking man said.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I wondered why this man called my father, father.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Don’t worry Jack, you did the right thing. They are trying the take Grace and Isabella.” My father said. My head started to hurt from all of the new, weird, information. I rubbed my neck trying to get at the pain.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“What would you like me to do with him?” Jack asked.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>“Let’s get rid of the body. A grave by the lake should do. I think it is time for me to take the plan into action to get the girls out of here. I hope that they can find a safer life. I hope that they can get sufficiently lost in the system.” My father said. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>Jack knelt down and scooped up the dead body with no effort. </emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>My father opened the door next the where the body lay. Inside the room slept Isabella. I could see the sadness and the age in my father that he was going to have to let us go.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>The world began to shake.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I could feel myself losing the dream.</emphasis></p>
   <p><emphasis>I still didn’t know anything.</emphasis></p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>My eyes burst opened and I was surrounded by flames. Not my hottest but they were hot. I made them vanish. I saw Alice standing outside of the large spinning ring taking notes on her tablet.</p>
   <p>“What happened?” I pushed myself up on the chair and watched the ring slow.</p>
   <p>“You have been out for about three hours and about a quarter of the way in, you burst into flames.” She said helping me out of the machine, she handed me a robe.</p>
   <p>“What exactly was the large ring for?”</p>
   <p>“It is a magnetic restrictor to keep you from sleep walking. It also projects an electromagnetic shield, that thankfully held your flames; much hotter though and you would have melted everything.” She showed me a place on the edge of the ring that had begun to melt.</p>
   <p>“I wonder why I did that. None of the dreams threatened me.” I scratched my head.</p>
   <p>“What did you see?” Alice asked.</p>
   <p>“A few things, first a little girl running through rubble… Then a young me being scolded for saying something mean to my mother while she was pregnant with Isabella. The next was my father having an argument with James Scott, that raises more questions, and sending me to my room, but he called me Isabella. The last memory was my father and someone named Jack finding a dead body in the hallway outside of Isabella’s bedroom.” I explained leaning on the nearest wall.</p>
   <p>“There is no way to be sure that what you saw was even the right thing to be looking for and on top of that, you don’t know if what you are looking for is in your memories to begin with.” Alice said inspiring great confidence.</p>
   <p>“I guess it won’t hurt to try based on what I’ve seen.” I left the room.</p>
   <p>Everything seemed newer then it had in the dreams.</p>
   <p>I went to my father’s office to try and log into his computer.</p>
   <p>Dark clouds had covered the sky so that when I entered the office it was pitch black. The light flickered on as I walked across the room to the desk at the back.</p>
   <p>I sat down in front of the computer. I didn’t even know how to turn it on. I reached up and wiped the layer of dust off the monitor. A blue box appeared in the center of the screen. It read <emphasis>please speak password</emphasis>, with a line flashing at the end.</p>
   <p>“Isabella Ward.” I said crossing my fingers.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sorry incorrect… Try again</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Isabella Madison.” I tried.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Sorry incorrect… Try again… twenty-four hour lock out pending</emphasis></p>
   <p>“Isabella.” I reduced to gripping at straws.</p>
   <p><emphasis>Commencing orientation, please wait while holographic projectors are calibrated.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I breathed a sigh of relief and leaned back in the chair. I was exhausted, but I didn’t want to stop and go to bed just yet.</p>

    <p>Chapter 30: Hope</p>
   </title>
   <p>When the holographic projectors were warm, they began to build line by line a perfect replica of my father before my eyes. I stood up from the desk and walked around to the front to look at the perfect recreation of my father.</p>
   <p>“Grace.” He smiled clapping his hands together.</p>
   <p>“You know who I am?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Of course I know who you are. My programming is based on recorded memory algorithms from your father. So in essence I am your father.” He said lacing his fingers and letting his hands fall very life like.</p>
   <p>“Well…Um…” I said stammering.</p>
   <p>“I guess I should speak first.” He chuckled.</p>
   <p>“I just didn’t expect to see my father.” I said leaning back on the desk and rubbing my eyes.</p>
   <p>“Your father worked for a long time to perfect my programming. He knew that you would come here, and deduce the password from those memories.” He said. His smile and movements were very life like.</p>
   <p>“How did he know what memories I would see?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“He put a trigger in your memory that would set off those memories if you went looking for them. Some were real, some belonged to other people. I’ll bet you are wondering why the password was<emphasis> Isabella</emphasis>?”</p>
   <p>I nodded but didn’t say anything. I didn’t know what to say.</p>
   <p>“Your father wanted you to find your sister. Just like if she were to have been the one who came here first. She was to look for you.</p>
   <p>Now… Here are the ground rules, young lady. First: You are allowed to access the entire knowledge base left behind by your father, except for these fourteen files.” He held out his hand and light blue representations of the forbidden files hover just over his palm.</p>
   <p>“Why are they off limits?”</p>
   <p>“These are files of things that your father wishes that he had never been a part of, or contain information that is not relevant to our current situation. I wish you to be free of them unless for some reason you are forced to be involved. If you ask the right question they will be unlocked.” He explained, closing his fist making the files vanish.</p>
   <p>“Fair enough, what other rules are there?”</p>
   <p>“The only other thing is, your father would like you to continue his work, however, that is more of a request, not a rule.”</p>
   <p>“Ok then, down to business. I need to know if there is any way with any of my father’s many inventions to track a kinetic user.” I said pacing around the room.</p>
   <p>“Ah yes, the AdvaGen satellite system is equipped with a kinetic brain wave detection component that can do what you ask. That is, if you have a profile of the user you wish to find.” He said, showing me an image of dozens of satellites orbiting the planet.</p>
   <p>I bit my thumb nail and paced around the room. I didn’t have a profile for Ryder or Vanish. I tried to call any of the numbers in my phone to contact the Last Line, but all of the numbers were busy.</p>
   <p>“What about an exact time and place that an occurrence happened on a pretty large scale.” I asked, turning back to look at the hologram that was doing nothing but watching me as I processed the information.</p>
   <p>“As long as the usage was in the tier two range or higher and it was within the last ten days.”</p>
   <p>I pulled out my phone and got the GPS location and the time that I called Sam to ask him to send Vanish. “At eight o’clock PM three days ago, near these coordinates,” I showed him the phone, “A teleporter used her abilities. She was injured and she had another injured person with her. They didn’t reappear where they were supposed to.</p>
   <p>“I will get you the most recent location that this ability was used. It will take roughly two hours. You should go and get some rest.” He patted my head and I could almost feel his hand but it was only wishful thinking.</p>
   <p>I left the office and as soon as the door shut my stomach growled like a lion. I followed the hallway to the kitchen. I started to go through the fridge.</p>
   <p>“Would you like me to cook you something?” Alrick asked entering the room from the deck out behind the house.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want you to go to any trouble.” I said, but my stomach interrupted me.</p>
   <p>“Grace you must get something straight. I am here to take care of you and your family. I take great pride in caring for the bunch of you. It is a difficult task at times but things like cooking are never any trouble.” He pushed me out from the fridge.</p>
   <p>“How can you have pride in things?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“I am a caretaker not an engineer. You should direct questions such as those to Chuck; he would know the answers before I would. Go and wait on the deck, it is a beautiful day and you need to relax for a while.” He pointed to the deck.</p>
   <p>I held up my hands in mock surrender. Then I turned and left the kitchen.</p>
   <p>I went out onto the deck and sat down in one of the chairs. I had a great view of the lake and the woods. To my left I could see the mountain and a glint at the top, the observatory.</p>
   <p>I laid my head back and closed my eyes for a moment.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“Grace, Grace.” Someone said softly shaking my shoulder. I jumped slightly and opened my eyes.</p>
   <p>“What is it?” I asked slowly remembering where I was sitting.</p>
   <p>“Your dinner is served.” Alrick said pointing to the two plates of food sitting on the table in front of me.</p>
   <p>“How long did I sleep?” I asked picking up a fork. I took a bite of the food and tried to contain myself as I chewed. It was the best steak that I had ever eaten.</p>
   <p>“You slept for about an hour. I take it that the food is good.” He smiled with pride.</p>
   <p>“It’s so good.” I was all but shoveling the food into my mouth.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I returned to my father’s office when I was finished with my meal. The room was empty but shortly after the door shut, he rematerialized in the center of the room.</p>
   <p>“I hope that you got some rest like I suggested.” The hologram said with a stern look.</p>
   <p>“I got a few moments of shut-eye. Did you find anything?” I asked becoming impatient.</p>
   <p>“Sorry, yes I did find something.” A map appeared in the air between us. “With the coordinates and the time that you gave me, I was able to generate a rough profile on the Kinetic in question. When you told me that the person was a teleporter, I assumed that there would be another identical spike at the same time, but it didn’t.” he showed me the spike when she disappeared.</p>
   <p>“So they just disappeared?”</p>
   <p>“For almost three hours they were not in this plain of existence. Take that at its face value, I have no clue where they were. When they did reappear it was several hundred miles away in the dead center of a crowded intersection.” He moved the map to the second spike.</p>
   <p>“Are they alright?” I asked.</p>
   <p>“Through some not so public channels I was able to secure a police report. A nearby police officer responded to two unconscious people, one with a gunshot wound. He took them to the hospital where they are undergoing treatment and under twenty four hour police watch. At least until they get more information.”</p>
   <p>“I need an address.”</p>
   <p>“I assumed you would. It’s in the printer.” He pointed to a freshly printed piece of paper.</p>
  </section>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 31: Flight</p>
   </title>
   <p>I grabbed the page out of the printer and left the office. I needed to find a way to get from Eastcroft to a small town south-east of Mankato, Minnesota where Ryder and Vanish had reappeared. I wasn’t exactly a legal driver and I wasn’t sure how a run in with the police would end.</p>
   <p>I contemplated going back to see if Sam had some one that could drive me, but that whole place was still locked down from the last mission. Going there would only mean complications and wasted time.</p>
   <p>I took out my phone and went to the map app. I entered the city of Mankato as my destination just to see how long the drive would be from my current location. It calculated for a few seconds and returned eighteen hours give or take.</p>
   <p>I went down to see Chuck who I figured would be the best person to ask about travel plans. I returned to the garage where I assumed he would still be working on the vehicles. He had pulled Ryder’s car into the garage and started to disassemble the thing.</p>
   <p>“Chuck!” I yelled walking into the open door.</p>
   <p>“Under the car.”</p>
   <p>I walked around to the front side of the car where his legs stuck out from underneath.</p>
   <p>I knelt down beside him, “Hey, got a minute? I need your help.”</p>
   <p>“What do you need?” He slid out from under the truck. He stood up and wiped grease from his hands with a rag he had hanging from his pocket.</p>
   <p>“I have to go to Mankato, Minnesota. It’s an eighteen hour drive from here. I was wondering if there were any toys down here that could shorten that trip.” I followed him as he carried a part from Ryder’s car to his work bench.</p>
   <p>“Land or air?” he looked up from a part that he was cleaning.</p>
   <p>“Whatever is faster and can be used to transport at least two extra people back.”</p>
   <p>“There is a small aircraft that your father was working on. It was supposed to be a “behind enemy lines drop craft” but he was never able to complete the stealth package. It’s fast, flies, and is very reliable.”</p>
   <p>“I don’t think that we will need any stealth.”</p>
   <p>He walked away from the workbench towards the back of the garage. I followed him past the many cars lined up along the walls. A small camera scanned his face. He then held up his hand. The camera then moved over to me. I did the same as he’d done.</p>
   <p>Thin lines on the wall appeared made of bright white light. The section of the wall that was outlined then slowly slid into the ground.</p>
   <p>Behind the wall sat a V shaped aircraft. It was a grey color, smooth finish with no lines what so ever. The cockpit was molded with the top and a passenger area tucked underneath. The engines were hidden in the wings, and there was a gun mounted to the front.</p>
   <p>“Who can fly this thing?” I walked around it, taking it all in.</p>
   <p>“Aside from your father, I am the only person that has been trained to fly this aircraft.”</p>
   <p>“Will you pilot for me?” I emerged from under the wing.</p>
   <p>“It will take an hour to prime the power cell and make sure that it is safe to fly. She has been sitting in this room alone for almost two years. I now regret not giving this vehicle more attention.” He said walking over to the wall next to the door. He pulled a lever that was hidden inside of an electrical box.</p>
   <p>The ceiling opened like a huge steel iris. Sunlight poured in from the outside as the sun made its final decent behind the mountain.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>After Chuck had determined that the aircraft was safe and the power cell was primed, he began to warm up the thrusters. He opened the back where there were four seats and enough room for three stretchers.</p>
   <p>“What exactly was this thing being built for?” I climbed into one of the front seats and pulled the safety harness over my shoulders.</p>
   <p>“Your father designed this craft to be used for med-evac extraction in times of warfare.” He climbed up into the cockpit. The door at the rear closed as the engines began to hum loudly, building power.</p>
   <p>The small craft lurched slightly as it began to lift off from the ground and gain altitude through the port in the roof. Chuck angled the nose of the craft and accelerated towards our destination. The floor of the craft became transparent; I could see the trees whipped by underneath of us. The aircraft flew very similar to a helicopter.</p>
   <p>I wondered if my father designed the aircraft because he thought something was coming or if he just had a good idea.</p>
   <p>“How long is the trip going to take?” I hoped that Chuck could hear me.</p>
   <p>“I am only going to fly at Mach one for safety so the trip will take almost two hours.” It sounded like he was sitting right next to me.</p>
   <p>“Let me know when we get close.”</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
   <p>I laid my head back and closed my eyes.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“I hate to disturb you but we are approaching the address that you gave me.” Chuck said pulling me out of a half sleep.</p>
   <p>“Where would you like me to land?” he asked as we swept over the hospital.</p>
   <p>“Get us a few miles away, somewhere secluded.” I tried to get a good look around.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
   <title>
    <p>Chapter 32: Hospital </p>
   </title>
   <p>Chuck set the aircraft down gently in a clearing south of the hospital. I could see the building from between the trees if I held my head just right. I climbed up into a tree at the edge of the clearing to get a better view.</p>
   <p>“I am going to have to sneak in; I can see at least six police cruisers in the parking lot.” I said down to Chuck who was checking the aircraft over.</p>
   <p>“Are you sure that you want to do this alone?” He looked up at me.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to waste the time. There is too much red tape dealing with them.” I lowered myself down from the tree. I jumped the last five feet stumbling just a bit with the landing.</p>
   <p>“What would you like me to do?”</p>
   <p>“Stay here. When I come up with a plan I’ll call,” I handed him my cell phone, “and I’ll tell you what to do.”</p>
   <p>“Yes, ma’am.” He nodded.</p>
   <p>“Please stop calling me ma’am! Keep the phone turned on, it’s already set on loud.”</p>
   <p>He gave a nod.</p>
   <p>The trees weren’t very thick at the bottom but the top blocked out the moon’s light. I moved in the same direction and refused to make any turns so I wouldn’t get lost. After about ten minutes I found the edge of the trees. The path opened into someone’s back yard.</p>
   <p>Houses all built in the same style; with slight color variations lined both sides of the street. Most of the windows were dark; there was a light here and there. I kept low and cut through the front yards and crossed the street.</p>
   <p>I stalked through a huge park that had a basketball court, baseball field, and a pool, and then I hopped a fence into an empty field. Then I entered the hospital parking lot ducking behind the cars. It was rather empty but there were enough to keep me out of view of the hospital windows. The cop cars were parked at the front of the parking lot; all of which were empty.</p>
   <p>I found a side entrance that gave access to a smoking area. The break area was unoccupied. I looked into the window at the dark corridor. I tried to open the door but it was very securely locked.</p>
   <p>I followed along the outside of the building and searched for the ER entrance. The parking lot in front of the ER was much fuller than the rest of the building. There were a dozen or so people sitting around the waiting room.</p>
   <p>I went inside and approached the receptionist.</p>
   <p>“Can I help you.” The large woman asked in a nasty tone.</p>
   <p>“I think my arm might be broken.” I said holding it gingerly.</p>
   <p>“Please take this form and fill it out. Bring it back to me when you are done and we will get you in as soon as we can.” She said handing me a clip board.</p>
   <p>“Is there a phone that I can use? My phone seems to have disappeared.” I said looking as pitiful as I could. She pointed to a phone near the end of the counter without saying a word.</p>
   <p>The phone had a sign on the wall above it that read <emphasis>Public 3 Minute Max.</emphasis></p>
   <p>I picked up the receiver and dialed my number and waited. Chuck answered the phone just before it went to voice mail.</p>
   <p>“Hey Chuck could you get me from the hospital.” I said then dropped to a whisper, “I am going to try and sneak in, helipad in one hour.”</p>
   <p>“Understood.” He said.</p>
   <p>“Thanks.” I said loudly and hung up the phone.</p>
   <p>I took the clip board to an empty seat near the door that lead out of the waiting room, and into the rest of the hospital. It was locked.</p>
   <p>I watched pretending to fill out the form. A nurse came from the exam area and began to speak to some of the sick people that were scattered around the room. I could see her keycard dangling from her hip, help on by a small metal clip.</p>
   <p>I got up suddenly and ran into the bathroom in a hurry like I was going to be sick bumping into the nurse as I went. I grabbed the card, melting the thin rope as I stepped back to apologize. I slipped the card into my pocket.</p>
   <p>“I’m so sorry.” I said through my hand feigning the need to vomit as I turned to finish the sprint to the bathroom.</p>
   <p>I burst into the bathroom making a show of things. I waited for a few seconds and then cracked the door a hair to watch the nurse. When she was finished with the patient she went back to the door and swore when she had realized that she had lost her card. She turned around and went to the receptionist.</p>
   <p>“Could you buzz the door? The stupid thing broke I swear they get cheaper every year.” The nurse said with a tired smile.</p>
   <p>The receptionist frowned and pressed a button under the counter, unlocking the door.</p>
   <p>I waited for a good ten minutes before I went through the motions in the bathroom so that it seemed like I had really used the facilities. I walked out, made sure that the receptionist wasn’t looking before quickly leaving the ER.</p>
   <p>I walked in the shadows back to the break area door. It was still empty so I held the card next to the panel. There was a small beep and the lock clicked. I opened the glass door and slipped inside.</p>
   <p>I wished I had kept my phone, I needed a flashlight. I crept along the walls. The whole wing of the hospital was empty. I looked into a room thinking that I would find a patient room, but it was empty. I walked slowly and as quiet as I could until I found an employee locker room.</p>
   <p>I opened a few of the lockers until I found a doctor’s coat that fit me without looking ridiculous and grabbed a stethoscope. I put it around my neck and closed the coat. The coat brought back memories of the Aurora facility and the smell wasn’t helping. Memories that I didn’t know that I had, but considering that we were in that godforsaken place for over a month and I only remembered a few days, who knows what I could have repressed.</p>
   <p>I went back out into the hallway and found the nearest nurse’s station, as empty as the hallways; the whole wing of the hospital seemed to have been shutdown.   I got onto the computer and looked for patient listings. There were no John or Jane Does.</p>
   <p>The Aurora Corporation logo flashed all over the screen. Rage flashed when T realized the hospital was enemy territory.</p>
   <p>I began to look for things out of the ordinary and I came across two people who were on a floor of the hospital alone. I assumed that would have to be them.</p>
   <p>Steven and Heather Smith, which should have stuck out as bad as Doe, were alone on the Fourth floor of the hospital. That made it easy; all I have to do is get them to the roof.</p>
   <p>I put the computer back the way I found it and left the nurse’s station for the stairs. I checked the door on the stairwell for an alarm. There wasn’t one so I headed up.</p>
   <p>I stopped before exiting on the fourth floor and took a deep breath.</p>
   <p>“Act like you own the place.” I told myself, trying to calm down.</p>
   <p>I opened the door to see a long hallway with doors down each side. The last door at the end of the hallway was guarded by two police officers.</p>
   <p>I had found Ryder and Vanish.</p>

   <title>
    <p>Chapter 33: Shock</p>
   </title>
   <p>I walked straight down the hallway to the guarded door. The police officer on the right moved into my path and held up his hand, “You are not supposed to be up here.” He said when I was close enough.</p>
   <p>“The doctor went home for an emergency; they brought me in to take over for the night.” I said as convincingly as I could, but I could already tell they weren’t going to buy my act.</p>
   <p>“Do you have your ID badge?” he asked crossing his arms over his chest.</p>
   <p>I rummaged in my pocket and felt the nurse’s badge. I didn’t use it because it would only destroy my ruse.</p>
   <p>“I must have left it down stairs.” I said flashing my friendliest smile.</p>
   <p>“Well when you go and get it I will let you in.” he said turning his hip to flash his gun.</p>
   <p>“It’s down on the first floor I just need to take a few notes, and make sure they are sleeping well.” I said making a big show of everything.</p>
   <p>“And once you get your badge you can do just that. I’m tired of you nosy reporters trying to get in here.” He said playfully punching the other officer in the shoulder.</p>
   <p>“I do have to say, she is the best looking imposter of the day.” The other officer said grinning ear to ear.</p>
   <p>The two men stopped joking in instantly and both pulled their guns. I threw up my hands and dropped to the ground. A rain of bullet fire peppered the two men in front of me. I covered my head.</p>
   <p>When the bullets stopped, I opened my eyes to see the two police officers both dead. The wall behind them was Swiss cheese and covered in blood.</p>
   <p>I took a deep breath and shot to my feet spinning to look at the murderers. I didn’t think, I held out my arms and blasted a flame down the hall taking out no less than a dozen Saber soldiers that lined both sides of the hallway. Behind them at the other end of the hallway, leading the group, was someone that I thought I would never see again.</p>
   <p>Jolt.</p>
   <p>My flames whirled around him and dissipated. He stood unshaken with a nasty grin on his face. There was something different about him. Bolts of energy randomly arched from his body to the walls surrounding him. His eyes were glowing blue, and when he opened his mouth to speak his teeth were the same color as his eyes; bolts of energy arching from his lower jaw to his upper.</p>
   <p>“Fancy running into you here.” He said taking a step forward and examining his soldiers.</p>
   <p>“You should be dead.” I said trying not to panic.</p>
   <p>“Funny thing, there is a chunk missing. I don’t remember much after our last encounter but I really don’t care. I have a mission.” He said walking a few steps closer, checking another of his soldiers.</p>
   <p>“I don’t want to fight.” I said taking a steady step backward towards the door.</p>
   <p>He looked up at me and smiled, “It seems that you have done a good job of taking these guys out.” He paused. “Version three Sabers, so disappointing. They really need to get these things worked out. You’d think heat resistance would be at the top of the list.” He added. “You said that I should be dead. I do remember a blast from, what is it you call him?”</p>
   <p>“Arch.” I growled.</p>
   <p>“Yes, Arch.” He said pointing at me absent mindedly, “I woke up later in a lab. I don’t know what they were sticking me with but I don’t care. I feel so powerful.” As he said the last word he opened his hands and shot a few bolts of lightning from his palms.</p>
   <p>“Well isn’t that good for you.” I was backed into the wall.</p>
   <p>“It’s a shame that you don’t want to fight. I’ll just have to kill you and the two you are guarding in there.” He nodded towards the door.</p>
   <p>He stopped talking and threw himself at me. Bolts of lightning streaked behind him. I was just barely able to move out of the path of his fist. He put a huge hole in the wall.</p>
   <p>I got up off the ground and tackled him with all my weight but it did nothing but put him off balance. He balled his fist and punched me in the stomach sending me flying into the ceiling. I succumbed to gravity, and slammed face first into the ground.</p>
   <p>He spit blood onto the ground and wiped his mouth.</p>
   <p>“Not bad.” He said.</p>
   <p>I pulled myself up off the ground, my ribs were killing me. I balled my fist and ignited it into yellow flames. I punched him in the face and fired a ball of flame into his head. This time when I attacked I knocked him onto the ground.</p>
   <p>He stood shaking the pain from his face. His skin charred from the flames. He was angry; my attack had touched a nerve. I took a few steps back, but he didn’t use a physical attack. He slammed his hands together and spread them causing a ball of energy to charge in between them.</p>
   <p>I had nowhere to go. When he threw the ball, it collided with my chest and slammed me into the wall. Holding me there for what felt like forever, I could feel the energy from the attack coursing through my body.</p>
   <p>Again I fell to the ground.</p>
   <p>“You are so weak!” he yelled as I screamed in agony.</p>
   <p>I took a few deep breaths and pushed past the pain. I pushed myself up on my fists and then I stood. My muscles were tensing with the residual energy.</p>
   <p>“Is that the best you can do?” I was barely able to get the words out of my mouth.</p>
   <p>He slammed his hands together again but I took the opportunity. I threw a quick ball of plasma at him. Timing everything perfectly, I ran as fast as I could right behind the ball of pulsating flame. When the attack hit him, I tackled him with all of my momentum.</p>
   <p>We crashed through outer wall and fell the four stories onto a parked car below. Jolt took the bulk of the impact.</p>
   <p>I rolled myself off of him and fell two feet down onto the ground.</p>
   <p>He wasn’t moving but he was breathing.</p>
   <p>I slowly pushed myself up; I quickly realized that my left arm was broken so I kept my weight on my other arm. I walked over to the building and into the ER door this time with my arm hurt for real. I placed my hand on the door and melted the lock with a little heat.</p>
   <p>No one tried to stop me. The receptionist stood but quickly sat right back down in her chair.</p>
   <p>I got into the elevator. The nurse that I’d stolen the ID badge from was standing next to me. I reached into my pocket and gingerly pulled her badge out and handed it to her.</p>
   <p>“Sorry.”</p>
   <p>She took it and nodded. Then she took a small step away from me.</p>
   <p>Back on the top floor, I looked down through the fresh hole in the wall at the still unconscious body of Jolt. He had not moved.</p>
   <p>I found an abandoned stretcher and pulled to Vanish and Ryder’s room.</p>
   <p>Ryder was unconscious but his machines were active. Vanish was strapped to a table with a gag in her mouth. I took out the gag.</p>
   <p>“Are you alright?” I asked undoing the bindings. I worked slowly, holding my injured arm to my body.</p>
   <p>“I wouldn’t tell them who we are and I was making a scene.” She rubbed her wrists.</p>
   <p>“I’ve got a ride waiting on the roof; help me get him onto the stretcher.” I pulled the stretcher over next to Ryder’s bed.</p>
   <p>We gently lifted him and placed him down on the stretcher. He was out; an explosion wouldn’t have woken him.</p>
   <p>We pushed Ryder to the elevator and when the door closed I pressed the roof button. The elevator moved up slowly.</p>
   <p>The doors opened to an empty helipad.</p>
   <p>Chuck was not waiting like I had instructed.</p>

    <p>Chapter 34: Invisible</p>
   </title>
   <p>“I thought you had a ride?” Vanish asked, tired and weak.</p>
   <p>“He is supposed to be here.” I said limping out onto the helipad. There was no sign of Chuck. I walked over to the edge to check on Jolt and to my horror, he was gone. Only a smashed car remained where he had landed.</p>
   <p>When I turned around, the air in the center of the helipad began to shimmer and slowly the aircraft began to reappear.</p>
   <p>Vanish pushed Ryder out of the elevator and onto the occupied helipad. The back door of the aircraft opened and Chuck walked out onto the helipad with us.</p>
   <p>“I thought the stealth package wasn’t working.” I asked Chuck as he grabbed a hold of Ryder’s stretcher and pulled it into the passenger bay.</p>
   <p>“Your father was farther along than his notes let on, he often left break advancements out until he was happy with the finished product. While I was flying to the helipad, I hit a small patch of turbulence that caused me to bump the stealth controls. It took me a moment to deactivate the stealth and the computer wouldn’t let me open the door until I deactivated the stealth system. I apologize.” He explained as he strapped Ryder down.</p>
   <p>“We don’t have time for apologies. I don’t know where Jolt is; we need to get out of here.” I said sitting down and instructing Vanish to do the same. We both strapped into the seats and I gave Chuck the thumbs up.</p>
   <p>He closed the rear door and climbed up the ladder into the cockpit. He flawlessly lifted the aircraft up off of the roof and began to take us away from the building.</p>
   <p>The back of the aircraft shifted violently to one side.</p>
   <p>“I guess this is Jolt.” Chuck yelled down from the cockpit. A holographic projection of the outside of the aircraft appeared in front of where Vanish and I sat. Jolt clung onto the wing.</p>
   <p>Chuck dropped the left side of the aircraft suddenly making my stomach jump up into my throat. The maneuver caused Jolt to lose his grip and fall. He grabbed a tree branch on his way down and slammed into the ground.</p>
   <p>Once Chuck regained our altitude and had gotten us back on course, we all took a breath of relief.</p>
   <p>“Could you take us to Eastcroft instead of heading back to the lake house?”</p>
   <p>“Yes ma’am.”</p>
   <p>I turned to Vanish who hung her head, “What happened?” I asked. I wanted to know where they had disappeared to for a half an hour.</p>
   <p>“I don’t really know how to describe what happened. I remember there being a lot of bright white lights and cold. I couldn’t really make out anything. My vision was blurred the whole time.” She didn’t look up.</p>
   <p>“Well whatever happened, I’m glad to have you both back and in one piece. What did the doctors do to treat his gunshot?” I nodded towards Ryder.</p>
   <p>“He was taken to several surgeries but I don’t think they accomplished anything. Silence never seemed to get any better. Everything they tried, they could not get the wound to heal. I hope that Doctor Z will be able to do something.” She wiped tears from her cheeks.</p>
   <p>“I’m sure that Doctor Z will have the answer. I’m sure he is going to be just fine.” I hid my worry, I wasn’t sure if he would be able to do anything.</p>
   <p>I watched Ryder as he rocked back and forth with the motion of the aircraft.</p>
   <p>“Grace, we are nearing Eastcroft. I think that you should try and call their traffic control and request permission for landing.” Chuck announced, “I could land in stealth.”</p>
   <p>“No need, I’m sure they will let us land.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Go ahead whenever you‘re ready.”</p>
   <p>“Eastcroft this is Sear, requesting permission to land immediately.”</p>
   <p>“All air traffic has been halted; please proceed to another landing area.” said a man from the control tower.</p>
   <p>“Please find Acumen; I assure you that he will let us land.” I said with desperation.</p>
   <p>The line was dead for a few moments, “Please state reason for requesting permission to land.” The man said.</p>
   <p>I was quickly becoming irritated.</p>
   <p>“There are three injured people and we need to land now. Silence and Vanish need medical attention.” I practically yelled at the man in the tower.</p>
   <p>“Permission granted.” said Sam over the line.</p>
   <p>Chuck set the aircraft down softly near the hanger. I unbuckled my safety belt and stood, shaky from my injuries. I helped Chuck unbuckle Ryder from the aircraft. He opened the rear door and pushed the stretcher out onto the tarmac.</p>
   <p>“I found someone.”</p>
   <p>Sam’s face lit up with the sight of Ryder.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I sat in the lobby of the clinic.</p>
   <p>I was alone and in pain. My head was killing me and I could only imagine what was coming from Alice when I got back home.</p>
   <p>Ryder was in with Doctor Z and Vanish had been escorted home by Hothead. He was so happy to see Vanish that he almost crushed me.</p>
   <p>Sam joined me in the lobby, “It’s going to be a while but the good doctor is optimistic.”</p>
   <p>“That’s good.” I said exhausted.</p>
   <p>“How did you find them?” He sat down in a chair across from me, “And what happened?”</p>
   <p>“My father helped me find him, well a holographic representation of him. I gained access to his computer system and used some of the technology that he left behind.” I rubbed my face.</p>
   <p>“What happened when you found them?”</p>
   <p>“When I got to the hospital, everything was going great until a squad of Sabers and Jolt showed up. Jolt was pretty worked up on killing us.” I shifted gently in the chair.</p>
   <p>“Is he dead?”</p>
   <p>“No, he is not. It took everything that I had just to knock him out. I had to push him out of the fourth floor of a building.” I shook my head.</p>
   <p>“I’m glad you did what you did. You understand that I can’t condone what happened, but I’m glad. The others are on their way here.” He got up out of his chair and gazed out of a nearby window.</p>
   <p>“I understand.”</p>
   <p>“Grace, I don’t know what is going to happen next. We have had close calls before, but…” he sighed deeply, “Nothing like this before.”</p>
   <p>Just before I was able to doze off, the room filled with Ronnie, Sandy, Rachel, and Kenny. They were all excited to see me.</p>
   <p>“Hey guys.” I said awkwardly.</p>
   <p>There was a mumble of greetings and they all sat around me.</p>
   <p>“Why didn’t you come and get us to help you?” Ronnie demanded.</p>
   <p>“I didn’t want to waste any time and if I had, Jolt would have gotten there before me.” I explained. “Vanish and Silence wouldn’t have had a chance.”</p>
   <p>“I’m just glad that you are back!” Sandy grabbed my good hand and squeezed.</p>

    <p>Chapter 35: Lock Down</p>
   </title>
   <p>The first place I went after returning to my father’s house was to see Alice. She scanned my injuries with a sour look on her face the whole time.</p>
   <p>“Four broken ribs, arm broken in two places, and the same shoulder dislocated. You have dozens of cuts and too many bruises to count. Were you hit by a truck?” She fumed throwing her arms into the air.</p>
   <p>“No, I jumped off a building.” I smirked</p>
   <p>Alice stopped what she was doing and looked at me to see if I was being honest; “You are as bad as your father!” she steamed.</p>
   <p>“What? I did.” I shrugged, but quickly realized that shrugging was painful.</p>
   <p>“Well lucky for you I can fix most of this.” She grabbed my shoulder and swiftly pushed it back into place with a small pop sound. I yelled in agony but she rubbed a light blue gel onto the shoulder removing all the pain. “Quiet you baby.”</p>
   <p>“What is that?”</p>
   <p>“Pain killer.” She set the jar down and went after a small electronic device about the size of her palm.</p>
   <p>“You couldn’t have given me that before you popped my arm back into place?”</p>
   <p>“Would you have learned anything?” she turned the device on and began to wave it over my arm in slow, smooth motions.</p>
   <p>“I suppose not.” I winced, “What is that?” I pointed at the device.</p>
   <p>“This will fuse your bones and skin, but they will still be weak for a short time. You are going to have to avoid base jumping for a few days. Unfortunately it won’t work on your ribs.” She explained, moving to the second break in my arm.</p>
   <p>She wrapped my rips and sent me on my way.</p>
   <p>I went up to my room. I cleaned up as quickly and gently as I could.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>I returned to Eastcoft. I wanted to be there when Ryder woke up. I wanted to talk to him. I just wanted to be near him.</p>
   <p>Chuck drove me into town. He was a much safer driver then me, given that I had very little formal training.</p>
   <p>I met Hothead in the lobby where he paced around the room. Ronnie and Sandy were sitting, looking at the TV. They weren’t really watching it; they were just kind of staring in its general direction.</p>
   <p> I walked up and patted Hothead on the shoulder, “How is Vanish?” I asked. It occurred to me that I did not know his or Vanish’s real names.</p>
   <p>“She was not feeling well so I made her come and see the doctor.” He said, and like he just realized who he was talking to, his face lit up and he grabbed me in a hug and squeezed.</p>
   <p>I yelled in pain and he dropped me.</p>
   <p>“I’m sorry. I am just happy that you found her. I owe you everything!”</p>
   <p>“It’s alright, just a few broken ribs.” I fell into a nearby chair. “Hothead, what is your name and Vanish’s for that matter.” I gently rubbed my ribs.</p>
   <p>“My name is Gera. If you wish to call me Hothead I don’t mind it. Vanish, her name is Liz.” He returned to pacing around the room.</p>
   <p>Sam came out of the back wearing a surgical uniform. He had some blood on his hands and shirt. He took his gloves off and disposed of them in a bin.</p>
   <p>“What is going on back there?” I stood just a little too fast. I cringed at the pain. My head spun with any sudden movement.</p>
   <p>“We had to operate on Ryder. He is fine now.” He pulled his mask off.</p>
   <p>“Why did you have to operate?” I forced myself to keep calm.</p>
   <p>“The doctors that had him before didn’t try and remove the bullet. The bullet itself was secreting some kind of toxin that was keeping his flesh from being able to heal.” He dropped into a chair.</p>
   <p>“I came back to see him. Will I be able to today?”</p>
   <p>“Soon enough Grace.” He said, trying to keep from putting his arm in the blood on his shirt.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>After hours of waiting I was finally allowed to see Ryder. He wasn’t awake yet but Doctor Z explained that he could open his eyes at any moment. He also thought I would be the best person for Ryder to see when he awoke.</p>
   <p>I brought in a chair and pushed it close to the right side of the bed. I sat down and propped my feet up.</p>
   <p>I took his hand.</p>
   <p>I watched him breathe shallow for a while until I couldn’t hold my head up anymore and it wasn’t long before I was falling asleep.</p>
   <subtitle>~//~</subtitle>
   <p>“Wake up, I’m the sick one.” Ryder squeezed my hand.</p>
   <p>I didn’t open my eyes, “I’m pretty banged up myself.”</p>
   <p>“What have you been up to?” Someone had brought him some food that he was now woofing down.</p>
   <p>“Finding you.”</p>
   <p>“What about your parents?”</p>
   <p>“I haven’t looked into it yet; I was more concerned with finding you first.” I pulled myself up in the chair.</p>
   <p>“Well I am here now; let’s get to work finding your parents then.”</p>
   <p>“Whoa, calm down. You should rest.” I took a sip of his iced tea.</p>
   <p>There was a knock at the door. We both turned to Doctor Z standing in the doorway.</p>
   <p>“What’s up?” Ryder smiled.</p>
   <p>“Sam would like for everyone to meet in the waiting room.”</p>
   <p>“Are you sure that Ryder should be up and about.” I stood.</p>
   <p>Doctor Z pushed in a wheel chair. “As long as he stays in this for now, he will be fine. With the bullet removed you should heal much quicker.”</p>
   <p>We worked together to help Ryder into the chair and left the room to join the others in the waiting room.</p>
   <p>We all sat in the lobby waiting for Sam. Every chair in the room was taken. There were several people that I had not yet met, who lived in Eastcroft.</p>
   <p>Sam walked into the room. He was dressed in a business suit, tie and all. He looked very official. He looked as if a huge weight was pressed down onto his shoulders.</p>
   <p>He paced around the room.</p>
   <p>“I have to go and see the Overseers. For those of you that don’t know, the Overseers are a government committee that protects us from the outside world. I am afraid that they are not going to be happy with what happened on our last mission. They have already warned me once that we were ‘making too much noise’ on our missions.” He said making air quotes.</p>
   <p>“What is going to happen?” Sandy asked.</p>
   <p>“For now I am going to assure that we are suspending missions for the time being.” He scratched his head, “I wanted everyone to hear it from me. We are going on lock down. Until further notice there will be no missions or any kind of activity.”</p>
   <p>I stood, “Is there anything else?”</p>
   <p>“No, I think everyone should get some rest.”</p>
   <p>Everyone dispersed in a somewhat orderly fashion. I helped Ryder back to his room. We got him into his bed. Then I pulled the chair back up to where it was and got comfortable.</p>
   <p>“So what is the plan?” He cringed a little as he tried to get comfortable in his bed.</p>
   <p>“I’m going to have to find my parents myself and my sister.” I sighed, “But I’m not worried about it.”</p>
   <p>“You still didn’t answer my question.”</p>
   <p>“I’ll start by looking for my sister, she should be much easier to find.”</p>
   <p>“And what will you do when you find her?”</p>
   <p>“I don’t know yet.” I admitted.</p>
   <p>“We need to get started as soon as possible.” He said.</p>
   <p>“Maybe you should stay here. Sam will most likely insist.” I said.</p>
   <p>“Grace,” he said leaning up, but he hissed in pain and laid back down.</p>
   <p>“Calm down.” I said gently patting his leg.</p>
   <p>“Promise me something.” He said looking particularly pitiful.</p>
   <p>“What’s that?”</p>
   <p>“Promise me that you will always be mindful and you will always come back.”</p>
